# Namakanda (The Chapter On Nouns)

Now the topic about the nominal case-endings is being told 'Nama' is so called because (i) it tends towards the meaning and 
(ii) it brings (fetches) the meaning towards itself or in itself. That is a designation of matter. The noun is twofold : (i) Anvatthanama (noun according to the sense) and (ii) Rulhinama (noun grown by tradition). It is threefold as : (i) masculine, (ii) feminine and (iii) neuter like ruklcho (tree), mala (garland), and dhanam (wealth). It is fourfold as : (i) samaniianama, (ii) gunanama, (iii) kiriyanama and (iv) yadicchanama. For example : - rukkho (tree), nilo (dark blue), pacako (a cook), and sirivaddho 
(rich in glory) etc. It is eightfold as : Avannantapakatinama (ending in 'a' or 'a'), Ivannantapakatinama (aiding in 'i' or 'i'), Uvannantapakatinama 
(ending in 'u' or 'u'), Okarantapakatinama (ending in *0'), and Niggahitantapakatinama (ending in 'am'). In this context, the case endings 
'si' etc. are applied first after the masculine word 'purisa* ending in 'a'. 

> Atha nāmikavibhatyāvatāro vuccate.

Now the topic about the nominal case-endings is being told.

> Atthābhimukhaṃ namanato, attani catthassa nāmanato nāmaṃ, dabbābhidhānaṃ.

'Nama' is so called because:

1. it tends towards the meaning and
2. it brings (fetches) the meaning towards itself or in itself.

That is a designation of matter. The noun is twofold:

1. Anvatthanama (noun according to the sense) and
2. Rulhinama (noun grown by tradition).

> Taṃ pana duvidhaṃ anvattharuḷhīvasena, tividhaṃ pumitthinapuṃsakaliṅgavasena. Yathā – rukkho, mālā, dhanaṃ.

It is threefold as:

1. masculine,
2. feminine and
3. neuter

like rukkho (tree), mālā (garland), and dhanaṃ (wealth).

> Catubbidhaṃ sāmaññaguṇakriyāyadicchāvasena, yathā – rukkho, nīlo, pācako, sirivaḍḍhotiādi.

It is fourfold as:

1. samaniianama,
2. gunanama,
3. kiriyanama and
4. yadicchanama.

For example:

- rukkho (tree)
- nilo (dark blue)
- pacako (a cook), and
- sirivaddho (rich in glory)

etc.

> Aṭṭhavidhaṃ avaṇṇivaṇṇuvaṇṇokāraniggahītantapakatibhedena.

It is eightfold as:

1. Avannantapakatinama (ending in 'a' or 'ā'),
2. Ivannantapakatinama (aiding in 'i' or 'ī'),
3. Uvannantapakatinama (ending in 'u' or 'ū' ),
4. Okarantapakatinama (ending in 'o' ), and
5. Niggahitantapakatinama (ending in 'aṃ').

## (52-60) Jinavacanayuttaih Hi.

(The rules of Pali grammar are) applicable to the words of the Conquerer. 

This (vidhi) is adhikara (governing). "Jina" is so called because he conquered five devils. That is the Lord Buddha. The word of the Conquerer is 'jinavacana'. "Jinavacanayutta" means applicable to the word of that conquerer. (It was) applicable for Magadha's language which is the original speech (sabhavanirutti). That is the words of the Lord Buddha called 'the basic speech, and thus, it is governing rule. 

"People in the ancient times, and Brahma-s, (and children) who had never listened to the words before and also the Buddha-s spoke in Magadhi language. It is the original language". 

The governing rules, however, are threefold : (i) sihagatika adhikara, 
(ii) Mandiikagatika adhikara, and (iii) yathanupubbika adhikara. The 
'sihagatika' is so called because it can look forward and backward. Or that is also 'yathanupubbika'. Making it different from Sanskrit, in order to prepare the foundation as suitable to the words of the Conquerer, the technical terminology is told (by the grammarian) : -

> Adhikāroyaṃ. Tattha pañca māre jitavāti jino, buddho. Jinassa vacanaṃ jinavacanaṃ, tassa jinavacanassa yuttaṃ jinavacanayuttaṃ, tepiṭakassa buddhavacanassa māgadhikāya sabhāvaniruttiyā yuttaṃ anurūpamevāti idaṃ adhikāratthaṃ veditabbaṃ.

This (vidhi) is adhikara (governing). "Jina" is so called because he conquered five devils. That is the Lord Buddha. The word of the Conquerer is 'jinavacana'. "Jinavacanayutta" means applicable to the word of that conquerer. (It was) applicable for Magadha's language which is the original speech (sabhāvanirutti). That is the words of the Lord Buddha called 'the basic speech', and thus, it is governing rule.

> Sā māgadhī mūlabhāsā, narā yāyādikappikā;  
> Brahmāno ca’ssutālāpā, sambuddhā cāpi bhāsare.

"People in the ancient times, and Brahmā-s, (and children) who had never listened to the words before and also the Buddha-s spoke in Magadhi language. It is the original language".

> Adhikāro pana tividho sīhagatikamaṇḍūkagatikayathānupubbikavasena, ayaṃ pana sīhagatiko pubbāparavilokanato, yathānupubbikoyeva vā.

The governing rules, however, are threefold:

1. sīhagatika adhikāra,
2. Maṇḍūkagatika adhikāra, and
3. yathānupubbika adhikāra. The 'sīhagatika' is so called because it can look forward and backward. Or that is also 'yathānupubbika'.

> Sakkatavisadisaṃ katvā jinavacanānurūpavasena pakatiṭṭhapanatthaṃ paribhāsamāha.

Making it different from Sanskrit, in order to prepare the foundation as suitable to the words of the Conquerer, the technical terminology is told (by the grammarian).

## (53-61) Lihgaih Ca Nipaccate.

The gender is fixed. 

Gender is not different from noun. The gender is determined here just as it is applicable to the discourse of the Lord Buddha. The roots 
(dhatu) also are (covered) by the word 'ca'. Afterthat gender is so called by paribhasa 'parasamanna payoge'. That is which has meaning separated from dhatu (root), paccaya (suffix), and vibhatti (case-ending). From here onwards in all the context of the rules regarding vibhatti and paccaya the word linga is understood (continued). 

> Liṅgaṃpāṭipadikaṃ, yathā yathā jinavacanayuttañhi liṅgaṃ, tathā tathā idha liṅgaṃ nipaccate ṭhapīyati. Casaddena dhātavo cāti jinavacanānurūpato ‘‘purisa’’iti liṅge ṭhapite tato tassa dhātuppaccayavibhattivajjitassa atthavato saddassa "parasamaññā payoge"ti paribhāsato liṅgasaññāyaṃ –

The gender is fixed.

Gender is not different from noun. The gender is determined here just as it is applicable to the discourse of the Lord Buddha. The roots (dhātu) also are (covered) by the word 'ca'. After that gender is so called by paribhāsā 'parasamaññā payoge'. That is which has meaning separated from dhātu (root), paccaya (suffix), and vibhatti (case-ending).

> Ito paraṃ vibhattippaccayādividhāne sabbattha liṅgaggahaṇamanuvattate.

From here onwards in all the context of the rules regarding vibhatti and paccaya the
word liṅga is understood (continued).

## (54-62) Tato Ca Vibhattiyo.

Case-endings are added after the genders. 

By the force of 'ca' also the words ending in the suffixes tave. 

meaning of gender through kamma etc. and ekatta etc. Then, what are those case-endings ? The word vibhattiyo is governing :-

> Tato jinavacanayuttehi liṅgehi parā vibhattiyo honti. Casaddaggahaṇena tavetunādipaccayantanipātatopi. Kammādivasena, ekattādivasena ca liṅgatthaṃ vibhajantīti vibhattiyo.

Case-endings are added after the genders.
By the force of 'ca' also the words ending in the suffixes tave,
meaning of gender through kamma etc. and ekatta etc.

> Kā ca pana tā vibhattiyo? ‘‘Vibhattiyo’’ti adhikāro.

Then, what are those case-endings ? The word vibhattiyo is governing

## (55-63) Si-yo, aih-yo, na-hi, sa-naih, sma-hi, sa-naih, smiih-su. 

Si-yo, am-yo, na-hi, sa-naih, sma-hi, sa-narh, smim-su are called vibhattis (case-endings). 

Fourteen words beginning with 'si' are called vibhattis. In this context, si and yo belong to pathama, am and yo belong to dutiya, na and hi belong to tatiya, sa and nam belong to catutdii, sma and hi belong to paficanu, sa and narh belong to chatthi, smim and su belong to sattaml. Among the safinasutta, adhikarasutta, paribhasasutta and vidhisutta, the present sutta should be known as 'safinasutta'. In vutti, it is asked, "What is the use of the term 'vibhatti' ?" The reason is that we have the following rule :- "Amhassa mamaiii savibhattissa se" (120-243). 

Alternatively, this rule should be joined with the previous rules, for the reference to pathama and ekavacana etc. should be understood according to the meaning or according to the technical term belonging to other grammatical tradition. Reference to one is called 'ekavacana'. Reference to more than one is called "bahuvacana". Completion of two is called 'dutiya' and so on. Otherwise, on the force of 'ca' in the preceding rule, this would be irrelevant and meaningless rule. The rules 'Jinavacanayuttam hi' 
(52-60) and 'Lingam ca nipaccate' (53-61) are understood as continuing. However, the present sutta is composed separately to indicate that the declension also should be made keeping with the discourse of the Lord Buddha. 

> Syādayo dvisatta vibhattiyo nāma honti. Tattha si, yo iti paṭhamā, aṃ, yo iti dutiyā, nā, hi iti tatiyā, sa, naṃ iti catutthī, smā, hi iti pañcamī, sa, naṃ iti chaṭṭhī, smiṃ, su iti sattamī.

Si-yo, am-yo, na-hi, sa-naih, sma-hi, sa-narh, smim-su are called vibhattis (case-endings).

> Idaṃ pana saññādhikāraparibhāsāvidhisuttesu saññāsuttanti daṭṭhabbaṃ, vuttañhi vuttiyaṃ ‘‘vibhattiiccanena kvattho, amhassa mamaṃ savibhattissa se’’ti, itarathā purimasuttena ekayogo kattabboti. Ettha ca paṭhamādivohāro, ekavacanādivohāro ca anvatthavasena, parasamaññāvasena vā siddhoti veditabbo.

Fourteen words beginning with 'si' are called vibhattis. In this context, si and yo belong to pathama, am and yo belong to dutiya, na and hi belong to tatiya, sa and nam belong to catutdii, sma and hi belong to paficanu, sa and narh belong to chatthi, smim and su belong to sattaml. Among the safinasutta, adhikarasutta, paribhasasutta and vidhisutta, the present sutta should be known as 'safinasutta'. In vutti, it is asked, "What is the use of the term 'vibhatti' ?" The reason is that we have the following
rule :- "Amhassa mamaiii savibhattissa s e " (120-243).

> Ekassa vacanaṃ ekavacanaṃ, bahūnaṃ vacanaṃ bahuvacanaṃ, dvinnaṃ pūraṇī dutiyātiādi, itarathā purimasutte casaddena saññākaraṇe appakataniratthakavidhippasaṅgo siyā.

Alternatively, this rule should be joined with the previous rules, for the reference to pathama and ekavacana etc. should be understood according to the meaning or according to the technical term belonging to other grammatical tradition. Reference to one is called 'ekavacana'. Reference to more than one is called "bahuvacana". Completion of two is called 'dutiya' and so on. Otherwise, on the force of 'ca' in the preceding rule, this would be irrelevant and meaningless rule.

> ‘‘Jinavacanayuttañhi, liṅgañca nipaccate’’ti ca vattate. Idha pana padanipphādanampi jinavacanassāvirodhenāti ñāpetuṃ paribhāsantaramāha.

The rules 'Jinavacanayuttam hi' (52-60) and 'Lingam ca nipaccate' (53-61) are understood as continuing. However, the present sutta is composed separately to indicate that the declension also should be made keeping with the discourse of the Lord Buddha.

## (56-64) Tad-Anuparodhena.

(The gender is fixed) according to the discourse of the Lord Buddha The gender as well as the verb by the force of 'ca' should be fixed as they do not go against the words of the Lord Buddha And in this section as well as in the akhyata section, the dual is not accepted and the concerned grammatical operations of the terminations etc. are differMit from Sanskrit In the context of the word-process in all the terminations beginning with 'si', it should be known that it is based on the desire of the speaker. 

## (284-65) Lingatthe Pathama.

The nominative case (is) in the sense of gender. 

The nominative case is just to indicate the gender. In that context, the pasanga of non-fixation of singular or plural arises; and as there is the technical term 'ekavacana' when a single one is to be spoken of, the nominative sing, 'si' is laid down, if the singularity of the lingattha is desired. The word 'ato' is continued from the rule 'Ato nena' (103-79) and also the word 'linga' is understood :-

## (104-66) So.

(After stems ending in 'a'), the case-ending 'si' becomes 'o'. This rule has two padas, that is, 'si' and 'o'. After the gender ending 
'a', 'si' becomes 'o'. For, in the rule, the expressions shown in nominative are to be understood as changing into genitive case for grammatical substitution. In this context, 'si' means case-ending because the present sutta (rule) 'Tato ca vibhattiyo' (54-62). Similarly, elsewhere, when grammatical operation is to be made on 'si' etc., the word 'vibhatti' should be understood. The loss of the previous vowel is to be understood as an exception, when usually, the loss of the following vowel occurs according to 'va paro asarupa' (13-15). 

(83-67) saralopo aih-adesappaccaya-adimhi saralope tu pakati. 

The final vowel is elided when the case-ending 'am', substitutes and suffixes follow; when, however, the vowel is elided, the word remains in its base form. 

The final vowel is elided before case-ending 'am', substitutes and suffixes; after the elision of the vowel, the word becomes the basic vocable. Here, the word 'saralope' is understood again in order to retain the base form when the modification of following vowel caused by the loss of vowel occurs. The expression 'arh-adesappaccayadibhute sare pare' is accomplished on the strength of the statement about the base form of the following vowel. 

"In this context, by the word paccaya, the suffixes *ti' etc. should be understood The word 'adi' is for inclusion of the verb, derivative etc. And the substitute is considered as base form due to being joined with the suffixes. Therefore, the final vowel is not elided, when 
'abhi', 'aha' etc. follow". 

The word 'tu' in the rule is to exclude the loss of vowel in the expressions like 'bhikkhuni' etc. It should be carried towards the following purisa are purisa; and not 'purisa purisa' :-
(388-68) Sarupanaih ekaseso asakiin. 

Of many (padas) identical in form, only one is retained. 

Out of the words or consonants having the same fomi, only one is retained; others are elided 'Asakiih' means ekaseso. Now in this context, the expression 'asakim' can be derived from the statement about 'sarupa' words. Why again the word 'asakirii' is used ? The reply is as foUows:- The word 'asakiih' refers to the padas having the same cases. And this word does not cover the expressions indicating repetition because the expressions of repetition are already accomplished through the word 
'pancapaiicaso' belonging to the rule 'vagga paiicapancaso manta' (7-9). 

Or alternatively, we may say that 'ekaseso' is applicable to the cases where there is reference to co-existents. 

"By yogavibhaga, from the expressions 'ekaseso', and 'asakiih', we can have the reference to the virupa ekasesa found in 'pitunarh' etc." 
Similarly, when the plural of the lingattha is desired, the suffix 'yo' belonging to the nominative plural is added by, 'bahumhi vattabbe bahuvacanaih' (paribhasa rule). In this context :- Purisa + yo. The words 'ato ca' are understood :-
(107-69) sabbayoninaih a e. 

'A' and 'e' are substituted for all yo-s and ni-s. 

the strength of 'va', 'a' is understood The word 'sabba' indicates the entire substitution. The vowel-elision etc. are similar to the preceding vidhi. Therefore, the following example is proved Purisa titthanti. The word 'va' is continued; for we have rupa rupani, aggayo munayo. The word 'va' is in the sense of vavatthitavibhasa. 

'Therefore, in the masculine, this rule is fixed. In neuter, it is not fixed But in the technical term 'jha' (i-vanna), the state of 'e' does not occur (asanta). This is indicated by va." 
Similarly, when the vocative case is desired, the rule 'Lingatthe pathama' (646-65) should be understood :-

## (285-70) Alapane Ca.

(The nominative case is) also used in addressing a person. 

'Alapanaih' means speaking fece to face. That is addressing. The ending of the first case is used to express the sense of addressing as well as to signify the sense of the crude form. Process of singular number etc. should be operated as before. In the context of 'Purisa + si' :-

(57-71) Alapane si gasanino.  
In the vocative case the (suffix) 'si' is called 'ga'. 

In the vocative case, the case-ending 'si' is technically denominated as 'ga'. Thus, this is the technical term 'ga'. The word 'ge' from the rule 'bho ge tu' (243-110) is continued :-

## (244-72) Akara-Pitadi-Antanaih A.

The vowel 'a' and the final vowel of 'pitu' etc. (followed by 'ga') 
is changed into 'a'. 

When 'ga' (vacative case-ending 'si') follows, the vowel 'a' and also the final of the words 'pitu', 'satthu' etc. are changed into 'a'. Now, the words 'ge' (fi"om the rule 'bho ge tu' 243-110) and 'rassarh' (fi-om the rule 'jhalapa rassaiii' 245-152) are understood 

## (246-73) Akaro Va.

When 'ga' follows, vowel 'a' belonging to gender is shortened optionally. 

This is applicable only when address is made to one who is not at distance. 

## (220-74) Sesato Loparii Gasi Pi.

After remaining stems the nominative and vocative case- ending 'si' is elided. 

The stems not included in the rules 'so sirii sya ca' (189-113), 
'sakhato gasse va' (113-132) and 'ghate ca' (114-178) etc. are refered to by the word sesa. After these 'sesa-s' stems, 'ga' and 'si' are elided The word 'api' is for including additional meaning. Now, in this context, even if 'si' includes 'ga' stems, 'ga' is mentioned separately to indicate that here 'si' does not include 'ga'. The words 'bhavanta' or 'he' 2ire to be applied by some grammarians for making 'alapana' clearly. Bho purisa tittha or bho purisa. It is not different in plural :- Bhavanto purisa titthatha. 

## (280-75) Yarn Karoti Tarii Kammaih.

That which (an agent) does is called an 'object'. 

That karaka which one does, changes or obtains and which is the sign of verb, is called 'kamma'. 

## (297-76) Kamatthe Dutiya.

The second case-ending is used in the sense of object The ending of the second case is used in denoting the object 'Am' is belonging to the second case-ending (and) singular as previous. When the vowel is elided by the force of the word 'saralopo' (83-67) and when the lengthening is caused by the rule 'dighaiii' (15-17), the base form is retained. Purisaih passa. In plural, the case-ending 'yo' is changed into *e' by the rule 'sabbayoninarh a e' (107-69). Purise passa. Similarly, it is desirable that the word 'kattu' should be defined :-

## (281-77) Yo Karoti Sa Katta.

The doer of an action is called an agent. One who himself does an action is called the agent Now, the word 
'tatiya' (648-83) is understood :-

## (288-78) Kattari Ca.

Also (the third case-ending is used) in denoting the agent. The ending of the third case is used in denoting the agent too. 

Now about 'na' belonging to the third case-ending, singular :-

## (103-79) Ato N-Ena. 

![9_Image_0.Png](9_Image_0.Png)

After stems ending in 'a' the case-ending 'na' becomes 'ena'. 

The case-ending is not denoted by the word *ena'. The case-ending 
'na' becomes 'ena' after stems ending in 'a'. Saralopa etc. are applicable. 

Piirisena katam. Now regarding the plural number :-

$$\blacksquare$$

## (101-80) Su-Hi-Su Akaro E.

The final 'a' becomes 'e' beft)re 'su' and 'hi'. 

When the case-endings 'su' and 'hi' follow, the final 'a' which is related to gender becomes 'e'. 

## (99-81) Sma-Hi-Smiih-Naih Mhabhimhi Va.

The case-endings 'sma', 'hi', and 'smiriT are optionally changed into 
'mha', 'bhi' and 'mhi' respectively. 

After all bases 'sma', 'hi' and 'smith' are optionally changed into mha, bhi and mhi respectively. Piirisebhi purisehi kataih. Similarly, when the definition of karana is desired :-

## (279-82) Yena Va Kariyate Tarii Karanaih.

That by means of which action has been done is called 'karana'. 

That by means of which something has been done, seen or heard is called Karana (instrument). 

## (286-83) Karane Tatiya.

The third case-ending is used in the sense of an instrument. 

The ranaining (vidhi) is similar to that of katta. For example :- Avitthena purisena so pufinam karoti. [He (god) makes merit for the men to whom he is living in (i.e. his body)]. Purisebhi purisehi. Similarly, when the definition of 'sampadana' is desired :-
(276-84) Yassa datukamo rocate dharayate vatam sampadanaih. 

One to whom something is desired to be given, entertained or borne, is called 'sampadana'. 

One to whom something is desired to be given, or one who entertains by something or one from whom something is home is called the sampadana karaka. 

## (293-85) Sampadane Catutthi.

The fourth case-«iding is used in die sense of 'sampadana' (dative case). 

The fourth case-ending is used after a word denoting the recipient 
(dative case). The (case-ending) 'sa' is belonging to dative case, singular. 

$$\mathbf{\partial}_{j}\mathbf{\partial}_{a}\mathbf{\partial}_{a}\mathbf{\partial}_{a}$$
$$\mathbf{M}$$
$\mathbf{-P^{-}}$
(61-86) Sa agamo se. 

The sound 'sa' is inserted when the case-ending 'sa' follows. 

After gender in all instances, when the case-ending 'sa' follows, the sound *sa' is augmented. Purisassa dhanaih dadati (He is giving wealth to a man). Now, in the context of plural, the word 'digharh' (15-17) is to be understood :-
(89-87) Su-narii-hisu ca. 

vowel of stems, too becomes long. 

These case-endings i. e. 'su', 'nam' and 'hi' having followed, all final vowels of stans are to be lengthened. By the force of 'ca', the rule becomes not applicable sometimes to the stems ending in 'i' and 'u'. Now, when the definition of 'apadana' is desired :-

## (271-88) Yasmadapeti Bhayamadatte Va Tarii Apadanarii.

From which someone goes away or fear arises, or something is received, is called 'apadana'. 

The ablative case relation (apadanakaraka) signifies that from something someone goeis away, fear arises, or something is received 

## (295-89) Apadane Paiicami.

The fifth case-ending is used in the ablative case. The endings of the fifth case are used to denote the ablative. The 
(case-ending) 'sma' belongs to paiicami ekavacanarii. Now, the words 'ato' (103-79) and 'sabbesarii a e' (107-69) are understood :-

## (108-90) Sma-Smiiiinarii Va.

(After stems ending in 'a') the case-endings 'sma' and 'smim' optionally (become 'a' and 'e' respectively). 

After stems ending in 'a', these case-endings 'sma' and 'smim' sometimes, are substituted by 'a', and 'e' respectively. Similarly, sometimes in other (examples), 'sma' is changed into 'mha'. For example :- Purisa, purisamha, purisasma apeti. In bahuvacana, all case-endings are similar to 
'bhi'. For example :- purisebhi, purisehi apeti. Now about the definition of sami :-
(283-91) Yassa va pariggaho tarii sami. 

One to whom something belongs, is called the owner. One to whom some property belongs is called 'sami' (an owner). 

## (301-92) Samismiih Chatthi.

The sixth case-ending is used in the sense of the owner. The endings of the sixth case are used in denoting the owner (in the genitive case). In all instances, there is similar form of catutthi and chatthi except when there is the substitute 'aya'. "Purisassa etarii dhanarii, purisanam". Now about the definition of 'okasa' :-
(278-93) Yodharo tarii okasaih. 

That which is the site is called 'okasa' (location). The site of an action of agent and object is called the Karaka okasa 
(location). 

## (302-94) Okase Sattami.

The seventh case-ending is used in the sense of location. The radings of the sevaith case are used in denoting location. 'Smim' is belonging to seventh case-ending and singular. It is changed into 'e' by the rule 'sma smirrmam va' (108-90). And it becomes 'mhi'. For example 
:- purise, purisamhi, purisasmirh patitthitarh. There is the vowel 'e' in purisebhi purisehi; purisassa, purisanarh; purisa purisamha purisasma, purisebhi, purisehi; purisassa, purisanam; purise, purisamhi, purisasmim, purisesu. Similar is the declension of the following words :- sugato, sugata; bho sugata or bho sugata, bhavanto sugata; sugatarh; sugate; sugatena sugatebhi, sugatehi; sugatassa, sugatanaih; sugata sugatamha su^tasma, sugatebhi sugatehi; sugatassa, sugatanaih; sugate sugatamhi sugatasmim sugatesu. Thus :-
"Sura (god), asura (danon), nara (man), uraga (snake), 
naga (serpent), yakkha /, gandhabba (divine musician), kinnara (a divine little bird with a head like man's), manussa (man), pisaca (goblin), peta (ghost spirit) /, 
matanga (elephant), jangama, turanga (horse), varaha 
(boar, pig), siha (lion)/, byaggha (tiger), accha (bear), kacchapa (tortoise), taraccha (hyena), miga (deer), assa (horse), sona (dog)/, aloka (light), loka (world), nilaya (dwelling), anila (wind), caga (donation), yoga, / 
vayama (perserverance), gama (village), nigama (small town), agama (scripture), dhamma (doctrine), kama 
(desiring), / sangha (group of monks), ogha (a flood of water), ghosa (sound), patigha (repulsion), asava (canker), kodha (anger), lobha (greed),/ sarambha, thambha (rigidity), mada (vanity), mana (conceit), pamada (heedlessness), makkha (detraction), / punnaga (species of tree), puga (betel nut tree), panasa (die jackor tree), asana (the tree pentaptera tomentosa), campaka (the campaka tree), amba (mango tree), / hintala (a kind of palm), tala (the palmyra tree), bakula (the tree mimusops tree (creeper), / mandara (the coral tree), kunda (the jasmine), pucimanda (the nimba tree), karanja (the tree pongamia glabra), mkkha (tree), / mayura (peacock), 
sakuna (bird), andaja (egg bom), koiica (the heron), and hariisa (swan) etc."

(The treatment of) masculine words is over. 

Now, (after the masculine gender) the words of the feminine gender are being told. The a-ending faninine word has not a literary occurance. The a-ending feminine word 'kaiina'. When the stem 'kaftiia' is formed:-
(237-176) Itthiyam ato a-paccayo.

"The feminine suffixes indicating basic meaning are like si etc. Na etc. are indicative of the meanings of suffixes together with the basic meaning." 
First, by the mle 'saralopo etc' the preceding vowel is elided and it is takai to the place of latter sound. Now, as it is told that 
'dhatopaccayavibhattivajjitam atthavam lingam', the case-ending does not indicate gender. Thus, the application of case-ending does not occur. By the word 'ca' in the rule 'taddhita-samasa-kitaka-namarh va tavetunadisu ca' (601-319), the stem with a feminine suffix also is called nama. The application of 'si' etc. should be known as earlier. By the rule 'sesato lopaih gasi-pi' (220-74), the case-ending 'si* is dropped Sa kaiiiia.

Bhoti kaiiiie, bhotiyo kaiina kaniiayo (O you girls). In the accusative singular, due to saralopa and pakatibhava, we have kaiinarii, kaiina kaiiiiayo. Now, regarding the third case-aiding etc. the words 'aya' and 'dcavacanaih' from the rule 'aya catuttha-ekavacananaih' (109-295) are understood.
