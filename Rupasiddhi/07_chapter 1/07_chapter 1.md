# Introduction

## Pali Grammatical Literature

Pali is the language of the texts which preserves the teachings of Buddhism. It has it's own grammar. The grammar of a language is the art of speaking or writing it with propriety, by acquiring the knowledge of the different parts of speech and the structure of sentences . The grammatical literature of the Pali language started from the times of Kaccayana or Mahakaccayana who is considered as the first Pali grammarian . The Pali term 'Vyakarana' is phonetically same as the Sanskrit 
'Vyakarana'. This word is derived as : 'vi + a + Vjkara + 'yu' suffix= 'vyakarana' . The term 'Vyakarana' is used in three meanings. They are i) grammar, ii) prediction and iii) answer. In the sense of 'grammar', it is found as a 'vedanga' belonging to the Vedic lore of learning i. e. Sikkha, kappa, Vyakarana, Nirutti, Chanda and Jotisattha. 

'Vyakarana' is very important among them. The term 'veyyakarana' means exposition or explanation, the function of which is to make thing explicit or clear. For the study of entire Pali literature (mainly Tipitaka

'Yw is changed into 'ana.'

(texts), Atthakatha (commentary), tika (sub-commentary) etc.,) a scholar should posseses knowledge of the following texts : i) Saddasattha or Vyakarana ii) Abhidhanasattha or Nigandu, the science of developing vocabulary or glossory of words, iii) Chandasattha or the Vuttodaya, a standard Pali work on prosody and iv) Alaiikarasattha or ketubha, the figures of speech or the art of poetry. 

Among these four texts, Saddasattha or Vyakarana is the most important because it is the basis of them all. It is said that 'The grammar of Pali language must be critically studied by one who wants to understand its literature generally, and by one who wants to penetrate into the abstruse doctrines of Buddhism, which exhibit the pure wisdom of its founder'. 

Even in the Dhammapada, the importance of the grammar is emphasized:-
"Vltatanho anadano, niruttipadakovido akkharanam sannipataih, janM pubbaparani ca sa ve antimasariro, mahapanno mahapurisoti vuccati." 
"He is a great man or a learned person who has leamt the rules of construction of sentences, combination of letters or syllables in words and determination of sequence or syntax." 
The word 'Nirutti' means 'verbal analysis', 'glossory', 'use', 
7 *PVL p. 424* 8 Mam p. 7 9 Dhp V. 352 10 HPL p. 631 
'expression of a language', 'grammatical and logical explanation of the words' or 'texts of the Buddhist scriptures.' In the verse, mentioned above, Nirutti is used to mean treatise on grammar. The grammar of Pali language has been composed in many countries like India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. There are many texts available. But concerning the texts which possess sutta-s (rules, aphorisms), vutti (supplementary explanation), and udaharana (illustration), in accordance with the Burmese tradition there are four schools : i) Kaccayana, ii) Moggallana, iii) Saddaniti and iv) 
13 Saddasangaha. 

The Saddasangaha's author is 'Yomanchi Ubholai' of Mandate who composed it in the year 2413 B. E. (Buddhist Era). However, the grammatical woiks of only three schools are well known : i) those which belong to the school of Kaccayana i.e. Balavatara, Rupasiddhi etc.; ii) the grammar of Moggallana with the ancillary works belonging to it like 15 Payogasiddhi, Padasadhana etc. and iii) Saddaniti. 

First of all, let us have an outline of 'Saddaniti' one of the three schools of Pali grammar. Its grammar is based on the Tipitaka. The treatise was composed by a grammarian called 'Aggavamsa', belonging to Pagan during the reign of the king Anorata in the year 1154 A. D. The Saddaniti 
// *Ibid* 12 Ibid 13 KcP p. (Kha) 
14 Ibid 15 PLL p. 49 16 PLB p. 16 17 18 consists of twenty-five Pariccheda-s or sections [according to W. **Geiger,** 
27 chapters; according to K. R. **Norman,** 28 chapters.]. The first eighteen are called 'Mahasaddaniti' and the remaining nine are called 'Cullasaddanlti'. 

That text has three parts : Padamala : the Garland of words, Dhatiimala: 
the Garland of roots and Suttamala : the Garland of rules. On the whole 20 it follows Kaccayana, but Aggavamsa also makes use of Panini. According to *Pitakatthamain,* there is a tika on it called 'Saddanltitika' which is composed by **Pannasami** Thera of Mandale and the *Saddanitinissaya* by 
- 21 U **Pug.** The *Saddaniti* was the first return gift of Burma to Ceylon which had been brought by the 'Uttarajivathera'. It was received with enthusiastic admiration and declared superior to any other work of the kind written 22 by Sri Lankan scholars. This treatise is still regarded as a classic in 23 Myanmar. 

Another grammatical work called Moggallana or Moggallayana Vyakarana, is considered as the up-to-date treatise on Pali grammar. It is also called 'Saddalakkhana'. It is based on the Sanskrit grammar viz. 

the Katantra, the work of Chandragomin. It is also based on the older works on Pali grammar. The thera named 'Moggallana' of Ceylon is the 17 Ibid 18 PLL p. 55 19 PL p. 164 20 Ibid 21 Pit-Sm p. 139 22 PLB p. 17 23 HPL p. 636 24 PLL p. 53 author of the treatise of the same name, which was composed in the reign of the king Parakkamabahu 1^^ (1153-1186 A. D.). He was the pupil of Mahakassapa of Udumbaragiri Vihara. Moggallana deals with the linguistic material exhaustively; and with greater understanding of the essence and character of Pali, which with the influence of both Sanskrit and Sinhalese had changed in comparision to the language of the earlier works on Pali grammar. It consists of six chapters i. e. Akkharavidhi and Sandhi : Terminology and Combination, Nama : Nouns or Declensions, Samasa : Compounds, Taddhita : Nominal derivatives, Akhyata : Verbs and Kitaka: Verbal Derivatives. Each of these divisions possesses sutta-s, vutti and udaharana similar to Kaccayana. 

Among the commentaries on it, mention may be made of 
'Padasadhana' of Piyadassi, the pupil of Moggallana; which was composed at the end of twelfth centmy^ and the *' Payogasiddhi'* which bears the same relation to Moggallana Vyakarana as the *Rupasiddhi* does to the 28 *Kaccayana. Payogasiddhi* was composed by Vanaratana Medhahkara, who 29 lived in approximately 1300 A. D., in the reign of Bhuvanekabahu III.

## Kaccayana Tradition

The principal and oldest work of Pali grammatical treatises is 32 
'Kaccayana-Vyakarana'. It is also known as 'Kaccayanagandha'. It is so called, because it owes its origin to the teacher Kaccayana or Mahakaccayana According to the tradition, he belonged to Jambudipa, i.e. 

33 India. According to modem scholars, the author of the Kaccayana-Vyakarana was probably a South Indian belonging to the fifth or sixth century A. D. They further add that this Kaccayana belonged to the Avanti school founded by Mahasavaka Mahakaccayana. Mahasavaka Mahakaccayana was contemporary of the Buddha, and had attained the 35 fourfold knowledge. 

The author of Kaccayana-Vyakarana must be later than the teacher Buddhaghosa who was well known irom fifth or sixth century onwards. Nothing is known about him except his name, and he seems to be unconnected with any other Kaccayana known to us from Sanskrit or Pali. 

The *Kaccayana-Vyakarana* is composed on the lines of *Katantrakalapa* of 30 Ibid 31 Ibid p. 51 32 PLL p 37 33 IC p 196 34 KacN p 39 35 Nam p. 12 

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

Sarvavarman and Panini. However the *Kaccayana-Vyakamna* is the most ancient Pali grammar that was composed by a first rate scholar and it is a very usefiil and valuable work for acquiring the knowledge of Pali 37 language. Kaccayana-Vyakarana consists of eight divisions i.e. Sandhi : 
the combination, Nama : Nouns, Declension, Karaka : Syntax, Samasa: Compound, Taddhita : Nominal derivation or the secondary derivation, Akhyata : Verbs, Kitaka : Verbal derivatives, and Unadi : particle, minor part of speech. Each division contains sutta-s or rules with great brevity, vutti or supplementary comments to explain the deficiencies in the sutta-s and Udaharana : the illustration, examples. 

This treatise has explained the grammar with rules briefly. Therefore, it is difficult for one who is new to it Thus, there are several commentaries which are connected with this grammar :-
1. *Nyasa or Mukhamattadipani :* The grammatical work based on Kaccayana tradition was composed by the Thera 'Vimalabuddhi' in the 38 eleventh century A. D. The author, according to *Sasanavamsa* was a thera of Pagan, but according to some other authorities, he belonged to Sri Lanka. The author of Saddaniti calls 'Vimalabuddhi' as 'Vajirabuddhi'. The work posseses sutta, vutti and udaharana similar to Kaccayana. There 37 Nam p 13 38 PLL p 38 39 PLB p 21 4() Tatha hi mukhamattadipaniyamsaddasatthavidhunii vajirabuddhacariyena nirutdnaye kosallavasena gosaddato yonamikaradeso vutto" Sadd T. p. 344 36 PLL p. 37 is also a tika on it called Thanbyin. 

2. *Balavatam* : The Pali grammatical work is a summary of the Kaccayana-Vyakarana. It has seven chapters. This treatise was composed by a Sri Lankan thera 'Dhammakitti' in the fourteenth century. But the Gandhavamsa assigns its authorship to Vacissara. The arrangement of Balavatara is similar to 'Laghusiddhantakaumudi' of the Paiiinian tradition. 

3. *Suttaniddesa :* It is also called 'Kaccayanasuttaniddesa'. It is a grammatical treatise which explains the suttas (aphorisms) of Kaccayana. It was composed by a teacher of Pagan named 'Saddhammajotipala' or 
'Chapata' in the year 1181 A. D. The Gandhavamsa adds that Chapata ^j^-
composed 'Suttaniddesa' at the request of his pupil 'Dhammacari'. In this *j^ -* treatise, we have the following passage which states that the rule 'Attho akkharasanfiato' was declared by the Lord Buddha himself; and that the author of *Kaccayana-Vyakarana* is **Mahakaccayana Mahasavaka.** 
"Eko vuddha-pabbajito bhagavato santike kammatthanam gahetva anotattatire salarukkhamule nisinno udayabbayakammatthanarn karoti, so udake carantarh bakarh disva udakabakanti kammatthanam karoti, Bhagava tarn vitathabhavaih disva vuddhapabbajitam 42 PLC p. 244 and GV p 62 pakkosapetva attho akkharasaniiatoti vakyamaha. 

Kaccayanattherenapi bhagavato adhippayam janitva attho akkharasannatoti vakyarh pubbe thapetva idarh pakaranam katanti kaccayanena katasuttantipi vadanti." 
'A certain aged monk having taken kammatthana in the vicinity of Bhagava, goes away, and sitting at the root of a Sala tree on the bank of the lake Anotatta, meditates on the kammatthana, repeating the word 
'udayabbaya'. He observing a crane (baka) moving on the water (udaka), 
meditates on kammattana, uttering the word 'udakabaka'. Bhagava, perceiving his inaccuracy, sent for the old monk and uttered the phrase 
'Attho akkharasannato', which signifies : 'The sense is understood by means of letters'. They say that the elder Kaccayana having percieved Bhagava's meaning, placed the phrase 'Attho akkharasaiinato' as the first of his aphorisms and composed his Grammar. They also say that the above phrase is an aphorism produced by Kaccayana himself.' 
Moreover, there are many grammatical works in the line of Kaccayana i. e. Kaccayanabheda, Kaccayanavannana, Kaccayanasara, Karika, Saddabindu, Vaccavacaka, Vacakopadesa and so on. According to a Thai scholar, the manuscripts of Pali grammatical texts are more than 134. Many grammatical treatises still lie buried in manuscripts. Some are reported to have been lost. 

## Place Of Rupasiddhi

Rupasiddhi is one of the grammatical works in the line of Kaccayana. 

It is a standard book on Pali grammar. According to **De Zoysa,** *Rupasiddhi* is similar to *Payogasiddhi* which is on the line of *MoggalJana-vyakamna.* 
The span of this treatise is very wide; and the treatise is mature. Rupasiddhi is called variously as : Rupasiddhipakamnaih, Padarupasiddhi, Maharupasiddhi, and *RQpasiddhi-atthakatha.* Let us consider the propriety of these titles :-
1) *Rupasiddhipakaranam :* 'Rupasiddhi's composition' or 'the text on Rupasiddhi'. This occurs as the title of the work and also at the end of the treatise. The word 'pakarana' if used in the title means literary work, 49 composition or book. In Pali it is often used to indicate a text, such as : Abhidhammapakaranam, Kathavatthu-pakaranarh, Nettipakaranarii etc. 

2) *Padarupasiddhi :* The author uses this word in the last line of the opening stanza. *Padarupasiddhi-tika* has given the meaning of this 52 word as 'Etymology of the part of speech.' It explains the word as follows :-

| 'Padaiii    | catubbidham   | vuttarh   | namakhyatopasagganca  - 53   |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| nipatancati | vifinuhi      | asso      | khalvabhidhavati'            |

48 PLL p. 54 (De Zoysa, quoted in catal, p. 25 f). 

49 PED p 379 50 STR p 6 51 Rup T. p. 1 "byattam sukandam padarupasiddhim" 52 PLC p 221 53 PDT p 24 
"It is said by the learned persons that the word (pada) is fourfold; Nama, Akhyata, Upasagga and Nipata, i. e. 'asso (noun), khalu (nipata), abhi (upasagga), dhavati (verb)." 
3) *Maharupasiddhr* : The meaning is : 'Rupasiddhi the great'. The preceding word 'maha' is used to show the importance of the work. 

4) *Rupasiddhi-At thakatha* : It is so called because it is a commentary on the *Kaccayana-Vyakarana.* 
5) *Rupasiddhi :* This name is normally used by the author in the title of the chapters and at the end of the chapters; *f. e.* 'Rupasiddhiyarh sandhikando', 'iti rupasiddhiyarh sandhikando pathamo', 'mpasiddhiyarh namakando', 'iti rupasiddhiyarh namakando dutiyo' etc. 

Rupasiddhi is written by a thera called 'Buddhappiya' or 'Dipahkara'. 

The author is referred to as 'Bhadanta Buddhappiyacariya' in the Padarupasiddhi-tika. The author mentions himself in the colophon : 
"Vikkhatanandatheravhayavaragurunam tampapanniddhajanam w ' sisso dipahkarakhyaddamijavasumati dipaladdhappakaso, Baladiccadhivasanvitayamadhivasarh sasanarh jotayi yo 57 soyarh buddhappiyavho yati imamujukarh rupasiddhirh akasi." 
"This perfect *Rupasiddhi* was composed by that monk who 55 PLB p 105 56 S p 463 57 Rup T. p 393 received the title of Buddhappiya and was named Dlpankara, a disciple of Ananda, the eminent preceptor who was like unto a standard in Tambapanni, he (Dlpankara) was renowned like a lamp in the Damila country, and being the resident superior there of two monasteries including 58 Baladicca, caused the Religion to shine forth". 

59 The other monastery was called 'Culamanikamma' or 
'Cudamanikya.' 
Buddhappiya's period has not been fixed yet. It depends on the time of the thera 'Ananda' whom Buddhappiya ascribes as his teacher himself. Most of the scholars viz. W. **Geiger, M. Winternitz, Malalasekera** etc. have pointed out that Buddhappiya lived in the second half of thirteenth century. He was a contemporary of the thera 'Vedeha'. The Elder 'Vedeha' was also a pupil of the Elder 'Ananda Vanaratana'. Buddhappiya is probably the same person as the author of *Pajjamadha* It is a poem composed in the praise of the Buddha. At the conclusion of *Pajjamadhu,* he gives his name and pupilage :-

$$\gamma_{i}^{i}\sigma_{i}$$
$$\mathbf{\mu}$$

"Ananda-raiiiia-ratanadi-maha-yatinda */l-^i/n'h c^/* 
niccappabuddha-padumappiya-sevinangi buddhappiya+ghana-buddha-gunappiyena *rP^/ ^^"^^* 
a, theralins/ racita pajjamadhum pibantu". 

58 PLC p. 220 59 Sadd be. [Nidanakatha] p. [k.] "baladiccassa culamanikammassa cad dvinnarh parivemnarh padhananayakabhuto. " 
60 HPL p. 203, PLL p. 51 
"May they drink deeply of these nectar-like verses (pajjamadhu) made by the bee Buddhappiya, delighted with the Buddha's virtues - who constantly attends upon that lotus, the Venerable Elder Ananda Vanaratana, heavy-laden with the perfume of his virtues and always in bloom". 

Malalasekera has written about the bio-data of Buddhappiya in detail from which we can conclude that Ananda thera was a disciple of Udumbaragiri Medhankara, the pupil of Sariputta who is the author of 
'Sarattha-dipani-tika'. Ananda Thera lived probably in the time of Vijayabahu III. He was the teacher of several disciples, who became scholars of note and authors of important compilations. Two of his disciples who are better known as distinguished writers are Coliya Dipankara and Vedeha Thera. Coliya Dipankara or Buddhappiya was a native of Cola country in South India but studied in Sri Lanka under Ananda Vanaratana Walpola **Rahuia** however has different view about the date of Ananda Thera, the author of *Mulatika.* According to him, Ananda Thera lived in Polonaruva in the tenth or eleventh century A. D. and had known the 64 *Rupasiddhi* of Buddhappiya. Further the author of *Moggallana-Vyakarana* knew *Rupasiddhi* of Buddhappiya. This means that **Moggallana** was composed after *Rupasiddhi* or it was contemporary with *Rupasiddhi.* We know that the Moggallana Vyakarana is a new grammatical school belonging to the twelfth century A. D. (1158-1186). Moggallana disagrees with Kaccayana about the number of the Pali alphabets. In *Kaccayana,* the Pali alphabets are fourty-one according to the rule : 'Akkharapadayo ekacattallsarh.' The alphabets are divided into 8 vowels (sara) viz. a, a. i, 1, u, u, e, o; 32 consonants (byafijanani) and 'am' which is a Niggahita. The 32 consonants are :- ka, kha, ga, gha, lia (ka-vagga), ca, cha, ja, jha, na (ca-vagga), ta, tha, da, dha, na (ta-vagga), ta, tha, da, dha, na 
(ta-vagga), pa, pha, ba, bha, ma (pa-vagga) and ya, ra, la, va, sa, ha, la. According to Moggallana, the Pali alphabets are fourty-three 'a adayo titalisavanna'. Thus two more vowels et and 6t are included Rupasiddhi, which is the re-arrangement of *Kaccayana* and which was composed in the 13 century is in dispute with Moggallana :-
"Adikakkharavantani ekatalisato ito na buddhavacananiti dipetacariyasabho." 
"The teacher had shown that the alphabets (akkhara-s) other than 41 are not the Buddha's words (buddhavacana)." 
Thus it is clear that *Rupasiddhi* was composed after *Moggallana.* Besides *Rupasiddhi,* Buddhappiya also composed a beautiful poem 67 CPD p. // 68 Rup T. p. 3 (rule 2) 
69 in Sanskritized Pali which contains 104 stanzas in praise of the Buddha. 70 *Rupasiddhi-tika* too was written by Buddhappiya himself. In the GV, it is said 'diparikaro namacariyo rupasiddhipakaranam rupasiddhitikarh 71 sammapaiicasuttaficeti tividhapakaranam akasi'. In place of the word 
'sammapancasuttarh, one finds the word 'Pajjamadhugantharh', according to 72 GV in Burmese script. According to GV, there is also the book called 73 'saratthasaiigaha' composed by Buddhappiya. Buddhappiya had a pupil named 'Siddhattha'. Siddhattha was the author of *Sarasangaha,* a work on Buddhism in prose mixed with verse. He probably lived in between 13 and 14 century. **Malalasekera,** however, called 'Sarasangaha' as 75 'saratthasangaha' instead. In the conclusion of the work, Sarasarigaha's author himself says that he was a pupil of Buddhappiya Buddhappiya's intention to compose the *Rupasiddhi,* as he has described in the first stanza, is :-
"Balappabodhatthamujurh karissarh byattam sukandam padarupasiddhim" 69 PLC p. 222 70 Ibid 220 f 71 PTS (1886), p 338 72 GV pp 331, 338 73 Ibid pp. 332, 339 74 PLL p 45 75 PLC p 229 76 Rup T. p. 1 
"I (Buddhappiya) shall compose the padarupasiddhi exhaustively (ujurh), transparently (byattaih), (having) proper chapters (sukandarh), for the benefit of persons who are ignorant (about grammar)". 

The words 'ujurh, byattam, sukandarh' indicate the methodology in the composition of the treatise. Moreover, the reason for adopting this methodology is given in the Sandhikappa (chapter on Combination) : 
77 
'Akkharakosallaih bahupakaram buddhavacanesu,' 'Having knowledge about the letter (akkhara) is of great use in the Buddha's discourse (Buddhavacana)'. *Padarupasiddhj-tika* comments : 'the penetration into the pariyattidhamma (the true doctrine of study) i. e. the *tipitaka* together with atthakatha, will be attained when there is knowledge of letters, and there the patipattidhamma (the true doctrine of practice) and the pativedhadhamma 78 (realizable aspects of the true doctrine) will be penetrated into respectively'. 

Therefore, the purpose of the methodology followed in the composition of Rupasiddhi is divided mainly into two as follows :-
1. to support the way of learning Pali grammar easily. As the Mabasiddhantakaumudi is much helpful to understand Panini's grammar, 79 similarly, *Rupasiddhi* also ia helpful for the study of Kaccayana grammar. 

2. to penetrate into the discourse of the Buddha in pariyattidhamma, patipattidhamma and pativedhadhamma. 

Besides that the author has also touched the five points of writing as :-
"Saiifia nimittaiii katta ca parimanarii payojanarh sabbagamassa pubbeva vattabbam vattumicchata". 

"Before writing the treatise, one should deal with (five points) v.z. sanfia, nimitta, katta, parimana and payojana". 

The author of *Rupasiddhi,* for 'saiina' or nomenclature, [which means declaring the name of text], uses the word 'padarupasiddhi'. The nimitta is twofold :- i) ajjhattikam nimittarh : the internal reason, ii) bahirarh nimittam : the external reason. These two reasons are clear by the word 
'balappabodhattham'. The word 'bala' indicates the external reason which means a student who had difficulties about learning and who caused Buddhappiya to compose the treatise. That shows his compassion towards the students. Thus, compassion is the internal reason. With regard to the 
'katta' or authorship, Buddhappiya uses the word 'karissaiti' which is the 'amhayogakiriya' (the verb of first person). But the name of the author does not occur in this context However, the name occurs in the colophon of the text. Then comes the parimana or measurements of the contents of the work. Its measurement is indicated by the word 'sukaridarh'. This means that this treatise has been made neither very brief nor very extensive. The gain or payojana of the grammatical work is twofold according to the author. It is as follows :- i) Mukhapayojana : Primary gain, ii) Anusarigikapayojana : Secondary gain. Among them, understanding of Pali grammar, is the primary gain. The secondary gain is that one can attain the highest position in the Buddhist Dispensation. The *Rupasiddhi's* author has shown these two gains by the use of the word 'pabodha' (in on 
'balappabodhattharh'). 

## Contents Of Rupasiddhi

Rupasiddhi is divided into seven chapters :-
1) Sandhikando : the chapter on combination. It contains five sections : Safina or saiinabhidhana, sara, pakati, vyafijana and niggahita. 

There are fifty-nine aphorisms. 

2) Namakando : the chapter on Nouns. The chapter contains also the declension of pronominals, numerals, personal pronouns; the use of indeclinables and inseparable particles (Opasaggikarh padarh, nepatikarh padarii). The aphorisms herein are two hundred and twenty-three in number. 

3) Karakakanda :- the chapter on syntax. It deals with the forms of nouns which are related to verbs. There are six case-relations i. e. 

kattukaraka, kammakaraka, karanakaraka, sampadanakaraka, apadanakaraka, and adharakaraka. There are thirty-three aphorisms in this chapter. 

4) Samasakanda :- the chapter on Compounds. The compounding of words is dealt upon in sixfold manner i. e. Abyayibhava, kammadharaya, digu, tappurisa, bahubbihi and dvandva. There are thirty-one aphorisms in this chapter. 

6) Akhyatakanda : the chapter on verbs. It is in three parts as follows : i) vibhattividhana : the construction of the verbal forms in which pada, purisa, vacana, vibhatti and kala are to be taken into account, ii) Vikaranavidhana : it deals with the dhatu : (roots) paccaya : (suffix) and vacaka (tense), iii) Dhatupaccayantanaya : It explains the procedure of the formation of the words ending in the 'dhatu-paccaya-s'. This chapter has one hundred and twenty-one aphorisms. 

7) Kibbidhanakanda :- the chapter on verbal derivation. In this chapter, along with the kibbidhana suffixes, the 'unadi' suffixes also are explained. There are one hundred and forty aphorisms in this chapter. 

Thus, the number of the aphorisms of *Rupasiddhi* is six hundred and sixty eight. The number of the aphorisms of *Rupasiddhi* according to the Thai, Sri Lankan and Myanmarian versions is different In the Thai and Sri Lankan *Rupasiddhi,* there are 668 aphorisms. But the aphorisms in Myanmarian one are 684. This, however, does not indicate less or more aphorisms; the number varies just because of inclusion or exclusion of the aphorisms repeated in different contexts. Further, the way of the classification of aphorisms under different sections varies from one another in the Kaccayana, Nyasa and *Rupasiddhi. Kaccayana* and *Myasa* divided the contents into eight divisions. Each division is called 'kappa' such as Sandhikappa, Namakappa etc. Section of a kappa is called 'kanda' f. e. 

'Sandhikappe pathamo kando', 'Namakappe dutiyo kando' etc. The topics of the first six divisions of the three texts are similar. The topic of the seventh and eight divisions of *Kaccayana* and *Nyasa* is the same as that of the seventh chapter of *Rupasiddhi,* 
However, the number of the aphorisms in the three texts varies. 

Kaccayana contains 673 aphorisms. *Nyasa* has 714 aphorisms i. e. 41 aphorisms more than *Kaccayana.* There are 36 additions of aphorisms in Karakakappa, 3 in Namakappa and 2 in Samasakappa. But in *Rupasiddhi,* there are only 668 aphorisms. *Rupasiddhi* excludes 7 aphorisms from Kaccayana and accepts two aphorisms from *Nyasa.* 

## Importance Of The Three Chapters

It has been mentioned before that *Rupasiddhi* consists of seven chapters. Here, however, as the title indicates, the three chapters i. e. Namakanda (the chapter on Nouns), Samasakanda (the chapter on compounds) and Akhyatakanda (the chapter on verbs) are the aspects which are selected for study. Let us deal with the significance of these three aspects. 

## Namakanda (The Chapter On Nouns)

Buddhappiya, the author of *Rupasiddhi,* re-arranges the rules of Kaccayana and gives explanation to make them easy to understand. The author follows *Kaccayana* and also adds some rules from other treatise for better understanding. *Rupasiddhi,* in the second chapter introduces the word 
'nama'. The meaning is 'the designation of matter'. 'Nama' tends towards the meaning and brings the meaning in itself. This chapter starts with the rule 'Jinavacanayuttam hi' (60) as in *Kaccayana* (52). Under this rule, we find the following verse :-
Sa magadhi mulabhasa nara yayadikappika 81 brahmano cassutalapa sambuddha capi bhasare. 

This verse refers to Pali as the language of Magadha, which was used by the Buddha-s. Then follow the rules about declension of nouns. 

In Pali, a noun has three genders :- masculine (pullinga), feminine 
(itthilinga), neuter (napumsakalinga). There are two numbers :- singular (ekavacana) and plural (bahuvacana). There are eight cases (vibhatti-s). The word 'purisa' belonging to the masculine gender, ending in 'a' (a-Karanta), is the first example given in this kanda. 

Let us note how the form 'puriso' is accomplished. 

- 'Si' is applied by the rule 'Lingatthe pathama' (65). - The case-ending 'si' is changed into 'o' by the rule 'So' (66) 
= Purisa + 0. 

- The vowel following consonant is dropped by the rule 
'saralopo amadesapaccayadimhi saralope tu pakati' (67). 

- 'O' is applied after 'S' by the rule 'Naye pararii yutte' (14). 

Thus, the form 'puriso' is accomplished. Similar process is followed in plural number and the other words ending in 'a'. In the Namakanda of *Rupasiddhi,* the first part deals with the masculine noun stems ending in a, a, i, i, u, u and o. The author concludes this part as follows :-
82 sattha-abhibhu sabbannu goti pullingasangaho". 

"Puriso gunava raja sa-aggi dandi ca bhikkhu ca The second part of Namakana deals with the declension of feminine noun stems ending in a, i, i, u, u, and o. The author concludes this part with the following verse :-
"kaiiiia ratti nadi itthi matulani ca bhikkhuni dandini yagu mata ca jambu gotitthisangaho". 

The declension of neuter noun stems ending in a, a, i, I, u, u and o are included in the third part. The chapter concludes as follows:-
"cittarii kammafica assaddha- mathatthi sukhakari ca 84 ayu gotrabhu dhammaiinu cittagoti napurhsake". 

The fourth part, consists of pronominals and numerals. There are twenty-seven words of this type, f. e. sabba, ya, ta, ima, dvi, ti, etc. 

There are also the words having no gender (aliiiga), like the personal pronouns 'tumha, amha'. These words have similar forms in all three 85 genders, f. e. tvaifi, aharh etc. (tvarh puma, tvam itthi, tvarh napumsakam). 

Rupasiddhi also deals with the nouns which end in the case-suffixes like 'to' in the sense of 'pancami' (ablative), and tra, ttha etc. in the sense of sattami (locative). Thus, we have the forms like sabbato, rajato, corato, sabbatra, sabbattha etc. The last part of the chapter on Nouns deals with the Upasaggas and Nipatas which also belong to the group of noims having no genders (aliiiga). They are also called 'indeclinables.' In the conclusion of chapter, the author summarizes by this verse :-
"PullingaiTi itthilinganca napumsakamathapararh tilinganca alinganca namikarh pancadha thitam". 

"The nominal words are fivefold :- i) pullinga : 
masculine, ii) itthilinga : feminine, iii) napumsakalinganeuter, iv) tilinga - having three genders and v) alingahaving no gender." 

## Samasakanda : The Chapter On Compounds

The chapter on compounds starts by mentioning the types of compounds; namely :- i) Abyayibhava : Adverbial, ii) Kammadharaya : 
Apposidonal, iii) Digu : Numerical, iv) Tappurisa : Determinative, v) Bahubbihi : Relative and vi) Dvandva : Copulative. These are dealt with as follows :-
85 Rup. T. p. 105 86 Ibid p 128 
'Abhyayibhava' is a compound having upasagga or nipata as the first member. The whole of the compound is treated like a noun in neuter gender with a Nominative Case and Singular Number. They are divided into two types i) Upasaggapubbaka : being preceded by upasagga and ii) Nipatapubbaka : being preceded by nipata. The author of *Rupasiddhi* has also dealt with the irregular Abhayibhava compounds. These compounds are not in Neuter gender with Nominative case and singular number. The author refers to the words like 'upanagarassa', 'upanagarasmirh', 'anto-avicimhi', 
'bahisaniyarh' etc. 

'Kammadharaya' is a compound having both members in the same case relation. The first member is thus either a noun or an adjective qualifying the other member. They are of nine types :- i) Visesanapubbapada: adjective is the first member of the compound, f. e. 'mahapuriso'. ii) Visesanuttarapada : adjective is the second member of the compound f. e. 'narasettho', etc. iii) Visesanobhayapada : both the members are adjectives f. e. 'katafica akatanca katakatam', etc. iv) Upamanuttarapada : the second member indicates comparison f. e. 'munisiho' etc. v) Sambhavanapubbapada: 
'dhammabuddhi', etc. vi) Avadharanapubbapada : 'gunadhanam', etc. 

vii) Nipatapubbapada : f. e. 'amanusso', viii) Kupubbapada : The nipata 
'ku' is the first member f. e. 'kuputto', 'kuditthi' etc. 

'Digu' is so called because the first member of a kammadharaya compound is a numeral. Digu is twofold i) Samaharadigu, ii) Asamaharadigu. The 'tappurisa compound' is sixfold. It is in the six case-endings beginning with the accusative. There are also the tappurisa compounds having different forms other than the six. They are i) 
amadiparatappurisa and ii) alopatappurisa. 

They are ninefold : i) dvipada tulyadhikarana, ii) dvipada bhinnadhikarana, iii) tipada, iv) nanipatapubbapada, v) sahapubbapada, vi) upamanapubbapada, vii) sankhyobhayapada, viii) disantaralattha and ix) byatiharalakkhana. The bahubbihi compounds have two members in the same case relation and are used in six cases. 

Two or more nouns joined by the co-ordinating conjunction 'ca' (and) 
being in the same case are called 'dvandva'. It is of two types : 
i) itaritarayoga, ii) Samahara. The itaritara dvandva compound is always plural and takes the gender of the last member. The 'samahara dvandva compoimd' always has singular number and neuter gender. This compound is especially used in the sense of limbs of living beings. 

The samahara dvandva is formed in different senses. In the dvandva compounds of the words denoting rukkha, tina, pasu, dhana, dhaniia, janapada etc., singularity and neuter gender are only optionally applicable. 

When there is the absence of singular, plural is applicable and gender of 87 the latter word is applicable. This is also called 'vikappasamaharadvandva.' 
In the conclusion of the chapter on compounds, the author summarizes by this stanza :-

| "pubbuttarubhayanfiatthap-   | padhanatta   | catubbidho   |          |                     |       |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| samasoyarh                   | digukamma-   | dharayehi    | ca       | chabbidho           |       |
| duvidho abyayibhavo          | navadha      | kammadharayo |          |                     |       |
| digu                         | dvidha       | tappuriso    | atthadha | navadha             | bhave |
| bahubbihi                    | dvidha       | dvandvo      | samaso   | caturatthadhati "88 |       |

"This samasa is fourfold according to the major members being pubbapada, uttarapada, ubhayapada and annapada. It is sixfold with the inclusion of digu and kammadharaya. The abyayibhava is twofold The Kammadharaya is ninefold. The digu is twofold The tappurisa is eight-fold The bahubbihi is ninefold The dvandva is twofold Thus, it is thirty-two-fold" 

## Akhyatakanda : The Chapter On Verbs

'Akhyata' is the pada indicating action (kiriyapada). The 'akhyata's components are eight types namely : Kala, karaka, Purisa, vacana, pada, vibhatti, dhatu and paccaya. Kala or time is divided into three. Karaka: case-relation or voice, there are three voices : i) Kattukaraka : Active voice, ii) Kammakaraka : passive and iii) Bhavakaraka : impersonal constructions. Purisa : Person. There are three persons. Vacana : Number. There are two numbers :- ekavacana : singular and bahuvacana : Plural. Pada : There are two padas : i) the parassapada and ii) attanopada. Vibhatti or case-terminations are eightfold as follows :- i) Vattamana vibhatti : It indicates the present tense O'accupannakala). ii) Pancami vibhatti : Imperative, iii) Sattami vibhatti : Potential, iv) Parokkha vibhatti : These terminations are used to express a past event not experienced by (present) senses, v) HiyyattanI vibhatti : Past tense, vi) Ajjattanivibhatti : Aorist. The forms of Aorist terminations are very rare in literature, vii) Bhavissanti vibhatti : Future tense, viii) Kalatipatti vibhatti : Conditional. This topic is concluded by this stanza :-
"pancami sattami vatta- mana sampatinagate 89 bhavissanti parokJchadi catassotltakalika." 
"The terminations called Pancami, Sattami, and vattamana are applicable to present (sampati). The bhavissanti is applicable to the future. The four terminations beginning with 
'Parokkha' are applicable to the past" The second part of the chapter on verbs consists of vikaranavidhana: 
the procedure of the conjugation. It deals with the roots divided into seven types i. e. i) Bhuvadi. ii) Rudhadi. iii) Divadi. iv) Svadi. v) Kiyadi. vi) Tanadi. vii) Curadi. The author concludes by this verse :-
"Bhuvadi ca rudhadi ca divadi svadayo gana 90 kiyadi tanadi ca curadi cidhadi sattadha." 
Suffixes are also classified in five divisions :- i) Kattupaccaya, ii) Kammapaccaya, iii) Bhavapaccaya, iv) Hetukattupaccaya. v) Hetukammapaccaya. 

In the final section of the chapter on Verbs, the words ending in 
'dhatu-paccayas beginning with 'kha' and ending with 'karita' are dealt with. When these suffixes are applied to root, the root's meaning is changed. 

There are also suffixes which change a noun into verb. Also the Karita suffixes i. e. ne, naya, nape, napaya are dealt with. They bring the sense of 'cause' (Hetu). 

This outline of the three chapters would reveal the importance of the grammatical topics covered therein. Accordingly, the present attempt deals with those important topics by way of critical presentation of the text in Devanagari script, English translation and critical notes wherever necessary. It may be pointed out that herein *Rupasiddhi* is appearing for the first time in Devanagari which is often convenient for Indian readers. Similarly, the translation of *Rupasiddhi* also is appearing first time in English. 

## Outline Of The Present Attempt

In the field of Pali literature, *Rupasiddhi* has become a constant subject of study in the monasteries. The present attempt is to study and interpret some aspects of *Rupasiddhi.* The author desires to explore the method of *Rupasiddhi* in the light of concerned literature. The thesis has four parts as follows :-
1) Text : *Rupasiddhi* has seven chapters. An attempt is being made here, to study the three chapters as follows :-
1.1) Namakanda : The chapter on Nouns. 1.2) Samasakanda : The chapter on compounds. 

1.3) Akhyatakanda : The chapter on verbs. 

As the text of this thesis, these chapters are presented in the 
'DEVA-NAGARI-SCRIPT' first time. The variant readings are recorded as foot-notes. 

2) Translation : Hereby, *Rupasiddhi,* though partially, appears in English translation, first of its kind. 

3) Notes : Some necessary notes also are presented to explain some rules or examples. Reference may be made to the word 'ekasesa' appearing under the rule 68. 

4) Bibliography : The thesis uses not only English sources, but also the editions available in Thai, Sinhalese and Burmese Scripts. The Bibliography covers detailed descriptions of the sources. 

Thus, the objective of this thesis is to study Buddhappiya's treatment of nouns, compounds and verbs. It is hoped that this would be the pioneer leading to the flirther study of remaining aspects of *Rupasiddhi.* 
In the translation part, the Pali sutta is preceded by teo numbers; the first number indicates the rule number in the *Kaccayana Vyakarana,* whereas the second one indicates the rule number according to Rupasiddhi.
