# Akhyatakanda (The Chapter On Verbs).

Now, the verbal terminations are being told (which are to be applied) 
after roots indicating action. The pada indicating action is called 'Akhyata' because it narrates (acikkhati) the action. For, it is told that the akhyatika word indicates kala, karaka, and purisa, and its characteristics is an action. Then in this context, past etc. are called 'kalo'. The object, subject, and condition are called 'karakarii'. The first person, second person and third persMi are called 'purisa'. The meanings of the roots such as gamana, pacana etc. are called 'kiriya'. Kiriyalakkhanam means that which has acti(xi as its symbol Oakkhana). And, the gender is not appliable. And it is also told that :-
"The word which has three kala-s, three purisa-s, indicating action, having three karaka-s and no gender, (and) having two vacana-s, is called 'akhyata'." 
Those which divide the root-meanings by the force of 'kala' etc. 

are called 'vibhatti-s'. They begin with 'ti' etc. However, they are eightfold: 
i) vattamana, ii) paricami iii) sattami, iv) parokkha, v) hiyyattani, vi) 
ajjattani, vii) bhavissanti and viii) kalatipatti. The 'dhatu-s' are so called because they possess an action. They begin with the root 'bhu' and end with those ending in root- suffixes 'kha' etc. However, they are twofold in the meaning as :- i) sakammaka and ii) akammaka. Among them, the roots which express action depending on the object are called sakammaka. For example :- katarh karoti (He is making a mat), gamam gacchati (He is going to village), odanarh pacati (He is cooking rice) etc. The roots which express action without expectancy of an object are called "akammaka*. 

For example :- acchati, seti, titthati etc. Further, they are sevenfold by the difference of the vikarana-suffixes. How ? The root 'bhu' etc. have 'a-vikarana'. The roots 'rudha' etc. have 'a-vikarana' preceded by niggahita. 

The roots 'diva' etc. have 'ya-vikarana'. The roots 'su' etc. have nu, na and una as vikarana-s. The roots 'ki' etc. have na, ppa and nha as vikarana-s. The roots 'tana' etc. have 'o-vikarana'. In their root-meanings the roots cura etc. end in 'ne' and 'naya'. Now, in the context of roots bhu etc. having a-vikarana, the first root is 'bhu' which is akammaka. After that 'ti' etc. are applied 'Bhu sattaya' means the root 'bhu' is to be understood in the meaning of existance. It means that that root is used in the sense of becoming which is pervasive (common) action. Now, when we have bhu :-

## (457-408) Bhuv-Adayo Dhatavo.

The 'bhu' etc. are called dhatu-s. 

The group of the words indicating actions beginning with 'bhu' etc. 

are called 'dhatu-s'. Bhuvadayo means the roots which begin with bhu. Or, 'bhuvadayo' means belonging to the bhu, va type (adi). 

"The sound 'va' in the word 'bhuvadi' should be know as caused by 'agamasandhi'. Or, the roots of the 'bhu' and 
'va' type in the sense of sakammaka and akammaka." 
The word 'kvaci' from the rule 'kvaci dhatu' etc. (517^72) is to be understood in the following :-

## (521-409) Dhatussa-Anto Lopo Aneka-Sarassa.

The final of the root having more than one vowels is dropped Sometimes, the final of the root having more than one vowels is dropped The word 'kvaci' is understood to cancel the lopa in 'mahiyati, samatho etc.' Thus, in this context, because of the absence of more than one vowels, the elision of the final of the root is not applied Further, when many suffixes would be available due to the governing 'dhatu' the pasariga would arise. Then the rule 'vatticchanupubbika saddappatipatti' should be applied, and when the word vattamana is desired :-

(423-410) Vattamina ti anti si tha mi ma, te ante se vhe e mhe.  
The ti, anti, si, tha, mi, ma, te, ante, se, vhe, e, mhe, are called 
'vattamana' (suffixes). 

The twelve (vibhatti-s) beginning with 'ti' are called 'vattamana'. 

Thus, they are technically called 'vattamana' because the vibhatti-s 'ti' etc. concern with the sense of the present. 

$$({\bf413}{\bf\mathrm{-}}{\bf411})\quad{\bf K}{\bf\hat{a}}{\bf l e}.$$

In the sense of time. 'kale' is the governing rule. After this (rule), everywhere, (the word 
'kale') is to be understood in the process of suffixes 'ti' etc. 

## (414-412) Vattamana Paccuppanne.

The vattamana terminations are used in the sense of present. When the present tense is understood, a vattamana suffix is applicable. 

Moreover, in this context, the word 'kalo' indicates 'kiriya'. EX)ing is 'kara'. 

The sound 'ra' becomes 'la' :- 'kalo'. Therefore :-
"When action is understood by the process of terminations, they are applied after the roots only; thus, terminations 'ti' etc. are accomplished" However, in this context, the specific word 'paccuppanne' is used because of kala being divided sixfold by the force of atita, anagata, paccuppanna, anatti, parikappa and kalatipatti. Paccuppanna means arisen (uppanna) depending on (paticca) different causes. The meaning is 'having obtained that nature, still not past'. 

"Vattamana vibhatti is used indirectly even in the tense which is near to present It is also used in past due to the force of the word kala." 
In that present tense, having applied a vattamana vibhatti, as there is not a rule indicating the place of that suffix, the paribhasa 'dhatulirigehi para paccaya' is applied. Thus the vattamana terminations are applied after a root When there is not fixation about the terminations, the pasanga eirises. According to 'vatticchanupubbika saddappatipatti', the word 'parassapada' is desired :-

## (406-413) Atha Pubbani Vibhattinaih Cha Parassapadani.

Now, the first six out of these terminations are called 'parassapada-s'. 

Now, after taddhita-s, the first six out of all terminations having eight groups beginning with 'vattamana' are parassapadas. Accordingly, they are fourty-eight padas. Thus, in the beginning, the nomenclature parassapada is applied to six terminations. Parassa-padani means the padas concerning the word 'dhatuhi' from the rule 'dhatuhi ne naye etc.' (438-524) is applicable :-

## (456-414) Kattari Parassapadaih.

The 'parassapada' is used in the active voice. 

In the active voice, the 'parassapada' is applied after all the roots. 

Thus, even having applied the parassapada terminations, the pasanga arises regarding their non-fixation as they depend on the desire of the speaker. By the modification of vibhatti, the words 'parassapadanaih and attanopadanam' are to be understood in the following :-
(408-415) Dve dve pathama-majjhima-uttama purisa. 

Two pairs are pathama, majjhima and uttama purisa-s. 

The pairs belonging to parassapada and attanopada suffixes are called pathamapurisa, majjhimapurisa, and uttamapurisa respectively. It is as follows :- ti, anti, belong to pathamapurisa, si, tha, belong to majjhimapurisa, mi, ma, belong to uttamapurisa. Also among attanopada terminations :- te, ante, belong to pathamapurisa, se, vhe, belong to majjhimapurisa, e, mhe, belong to uttamapurisa. Similarly, it should be applied in the seven remaining terminations. Therefore, thirty-two each are applicable to pathama, majjhima and uttama-purisa-s belonging to akhyatapadas divided into ninety-six by way of eight terminations. Thus, the pairs of pada-s are called 'pathamapurisa' in the beginning of parassapada belonging to the present terminations. 

(410-416) Namamhi payujjamane-pi tulyadhikarane pathamo. 

pathamapurisa (is laid down). 

When a nama except tumha and amha, having the same case-relation is used or not, the pathamapurisa temiinations are applied after roots. So having applied the pathamapurisa temiinations, - The pasaiiga arises due to non-fixation even of the pathama-purisa temiinations. In the context of single perfomier desired by the speaker, the paribhasa 'ekamhivatlabbe dcavacanaih' is applicable. Thus, present third person singular termination belonging to the parassapada is accomplished. The words paro, paccayo and dhatu are goveming. Similarly, the word kattari irom the rule 'kattari ca' (454-424) is understood in the operation of vikarana and paccaya. 

## (445-417) Bhuv-Adi-To A.

The suffix 'a' is used after the root 'bhu' etc. After the group of roots beginning with 'bhu', the suffix 'a' is used in active sense when the verbal terminations and suffixes follow. Only in the 'sabbadhatuka', the suffix 'a' is desired. The words 'asamyogantassa' and 'vuddhi' are understood in the following :-

$$(485\mathrm{-}418)\quad\mathrm{\bf~A\ddot{n}n e s u\quad c a.}$$

And when other suffixes follow. 

The roots not ending in conjuncts are lengthened when the suffixes other than karita follow. By the force of the word 'ca', the suffix 'nu' also is lengthened. Moreover, in this context : the word 'va' from the rule 'ghatadinarh va' (448-526) is to be understood. And that is in the sense of vavatthitavibhasa. Bv that â€¢-

"The M' vanna and 'u' vanna only of the roots ending in 'i' and 'u' vanna-s and penultimate short vowels are lengthened and not others. Even, the 'i' and 'u' vanna-s are not lengthened when the suffixes 'ya', 'nu', 'na', 
'na' and 'nittha' etc. follow. When the 'a' vikarana follows, the roots 'tuda' etc. are not lengthened. It is optionally lengthened in 'chetva' etc." 
When again 'pasanga' of non-fixation arises, the change of sound 
'u' into *o' is to be considered as vuddhi by paribhasa 'ajoivannanaiicayo vuddhi'. When the word 'dhatunaih' is understood by the modification in the following :-

## (513-419) O Ava Sare.

When a vowel follows, the (final) 'o' is changed into 'ava'. When a vowel follows, the final sound 'o' of the roots is changed into 'ava'. When saralopa etc. are made by the rule 'saralopo arh adesa' etc. (83-67), the paranaya should be done by the rule 'naye param yutte' (11-14). So puriso sadhu bhavati *(That* man is good), sa kafiiia sadhu bhavati (That girl is good), tarn cittarh sadhu bhavati (That mind is good). For, in this context : -
"The instrumental case is not applicable in the active sense because the katta is told by akhyata only. 

However, the nominative case is applicable because of the expected sense of gender". 

Even if, when there is a single verb, because of many performers, the rule 'bahumhi vattabbe bahuvacanarh' is applicable. Thus, the present third person plural termination 'anti' belonging to parassapada is accomplished. The suffix 'a', vuddhi, ava-substitute and saralopa etc. are applicable as before. Te purisa bhavanti (Those are men). Even when it (katta) is not used :- bhavati bhavanti. The words payujjamanepi and tulyadhikarane are to be understood in the following :-

## (411-420) Tumhe Majjhimo.

In (the case of) 'tumha', the second person (is laid down). 

When the word 'tumha' having the same case-relation is used or not, the majjhimapurisa terminations are applied after roots. Thus, the present second person, singular termination 'si' belonging to the parassapada is accomplished. The remaining process is as before. Tvarii bhavasi, tumhe bhavatha (you are). Or when the subject is not used :- bhavasi, bhavatha. Why the word 'talyadhikarane' is used ? For, we have :- taya paccate odano (Rice is being cooked by you). When the same words are goveming:-

## (412-421) Amhe Uttamo.

In (the case of) 'amha', the uttamapurisa (is laid down). 

When the word 'amha' having the same case-relation is used or not, the uttamampurisa terminations are applied after roots. Thus, the present first person singular termination 'mi' belonging to parassapada is accomplished. The suffix 'a', the vuddhi, and ava-substitute are applicable. 

## (478-422) Akaro Digharii Hi-Mi-Mesu.

When die terminations 'hi', 'mi', 'ma' follow, the vowel 'a' is lengthened. 

The vowel 'a' becomes long when the terminations hi, mi and ma follow. Tvarh bhavahi (You are), aham bhavami (I am) mayarh bhavama (We are); bhavahi, bhavami, bhavama. The words 'vibhattinarh' and 'cha' are understood in the following :-

## (407-423) Parani Attanopadani.

The latter are 'attanopada-s'. 

The latter six pada-s in each set of the entire eight terminations beginning with 'vattamana' are called 'attanopadas'. Thus, the terminations 'te' etc. are technically called 'attanopada'. The words 'dhatuhi' and 'attanopadani' are understood in the following :-

## (454-424) Kattari Ca.

And in the active sense. 

The attanopada terminations are also used after the roots when the case-relation is 'katta'. The word 'ca' is used to cancel the rule for some usages. The remaining process should be understood by that which is told in parassapada above. Bhavate, bhavante, bhavase, bhavavhe, bhave, bhavamhe. The root 'paca' is used in the sense of 'cooking'. The elision of the final of the root is applicable because the term 'dhatu' is applicable. 

'Ti' etc. are applied by the process which is told before. However, the difference in this context, is that the 'vuddhi' is not applicable due to the absence of 'i' vanna and 'u' vantia. So devadatto odanam pacati (That Devadatta is cooking rice), pacanti, pacasi, pacatha, pacami, pacama. So odanam pacate (He is cooking rice), te pacante (They are cooking), tvarti pacase (You are cooking), tumhe pacavhe (You are cooking), ahaiti pace 
(I am cooking), mayarh pacamhe (We are cooking). When there would arise a pasariga of simultaneous application of pathamapurisa etc. the following paribhasa is being told :-
(409-425) Sabbesam eka-abhidhane paro puriso. 

In single reference to all, the latter purisa (is used). 

The latter purisa should be applied when pathamapurisa and majjhimapurisa, pathamapurisa and uttamapurisa, majjhimapurisa and uttamapurisa or the three purisa-s together occur in single reference. And this abhidhana is applicable only when the sentences belong to the same tense. The alternative expression for 'so ca pacati tvarh pacasi', we have 'tumhe pacatha' (You are cooking). Similarly, for 'so ca pacati ahafica pacami', we have 'mayarh pacama' (We cook). Furthermore, 'tvafica pacasi ahafica pacami' becomes 'mayatii pacama' (We cook). Similarly, it should be applied everywhere. Why the word 'ekabhidhane' is used ? For, we have :- So ca pacati (He also cooks), tvafica pacissasi (You will cook), aham pacirii (I cooked). In this context, 'mayarh pacimha' is not applicable because of different tenses. The root 'gama' is used in the sense of moving and going. As above the elision of the final of the root is applicable because the term dhatu is applicable. In the active sense, 'ti' etc. are also applicable. 

## (476-426) Gamiss-Anto Echo Va Sabbasu.

When any (suffix) follows, the final of the root 'gama' is optionally changed into 'ccha'. 

When any suffix follows, the final sound 'ma' of the root 'gama' and karita suffixes are included The word 'va' is for vavatthitavibhasa. 

By that, this (is told) :-
"The word 'va' indicates fixation in the active sense, regarding the suffixes mana and anta. Elsewhere it does not indicate fixation. It implies negation regarding Parokkha." 
The suffix 'a' and the process of paranaya should be applied. So puriso gamaih gacchati (That man is going to the village), Te gacchanti (They are going). By the rule 'kvaci dhatu' etc. (517-472), when third person plural follows a short vowel preceded by garu sound, it changes into 're' optionally. Gacchare, tvarh gacchasi (you go), tumhe gacchatha (you go), aham gacchami (I go), mayaiii gacchama (We go). When the 
'ccha-substitute' is not applicable :- The suffix 'a' becomes 'e' by the rule 'lopanca ettarh akaro' (510-471). Gameti, gamenti :- Saralopa is applicable. 

Gamesi, gametha, gamemi, gamema. In attanopada also :- so gamam gacchate (He goes to the village), gacchante, gacchare, gacchase, gacchavhe, gacche, gacchamhe. However, in 'kuto nu tvaiti agacchasi' (Where do you come from ?), rajagahato agacchami (I come from rajagaha-city) etc. the vattamana termination is used in the sense of near to paccuppanna. The word 'va' is understood in the following :-

## (459-427) Gamissa Ghammaih.

The root 'gamu' (is changed) into 'ghamma'. The entire root 'gamu'' is optionally changed into 'ghamma'. 

Ghammati ghammanti etc. Furthermore, in the sense of bhava and kamma:-

(453-428) Attanopadani bhave ca kammani. 

The attanopada-s are used in the impersonal and passive sense. 

The passive terminations are used in the karaka called bhava 
(impersonal) and kamma (passive). By the word 'ca', they are applicable also to kamma-kattari. And that bhava is not connected with another karaka. The root-meaning is just becoming, cutting etc. Kamma is so called because the action takes place (kariyati). Even the akammaka roots having upasaggas become transitive. Therefore, in the passive sense after the root 'bhu' preceded by 'anu', the termination 'te' belonging to vattamana, attanopada, third person, singular is applied. When the word 'dhatuhi' from the rule 
'dhatuhi ne nya etc' (438-524) is understood in the following :-

## (440-429) Bhava-Kammesu Yo.

The suffix 'ya' (is used) in the sense of 'bhava' and 'kamma'. After all roots, the suffix 'ya' is used in impersonal and passive sense. The suffix 'ya' is to be applied optionally in the expression of attanopada. By the word 'va' continued from the rule 'aiiiiesu ca' (485-418), the vuddhi is not applicable before the suffix 'ya'. Anubhuyate sukham devadattena (The happiness is being experienced by Devadatta). 

"The instumental case is applied in the active sense because the subject is not referred to by akhyata. The accusative case is not applicable. In this context, the Nominative case is applicable because the object is referred to." 

Devadatta), anubhuyavhe tumhe (You are being experienced), aharii anubhuye taya (I am experienced by you), mayarh anubhuyamhe (We are being experienced). When the word 'kvaci' from the rule 'kvaci dhatu' etc. 

(517-472) is understood in the following :-

## (518-430) Attanopadani Parassapadattaih.

The attanopada-s (acquire the state of) parassapada. Sometimes, the attanopada-s are changed into parassapada. This is applicable only when it is not active sense. The sound 'ya' becomes double. 

Anubhuyyati or anubhuyyate maya sukharh (The happiness is being anjoyed by me), anubhuyyanti, anubhuyyasi, anubhuyyatha, anubhuyyami, anubhuyyama. When (the suffix 'ya') is not reduplicated :- anubhuyati anubhuyanti. Why the word 'kvaci' ? For, we have the form 'anubhuyate'. In impersonal construction, only the singular is applicable because of the singularity of bhava which has no object. And that (ekavacana) is applicable only to pathamapurisa. Bhuyyate devadattena (Devadatta exists). The meaning is present existance. And after the root 'paca' when the suffix 'ya' is applied in attanopada in the passive sense :- When the word 'yassa' is to be understood by modification in the following : -

## (441-431) Tassa Ca-Vagga-Yakara-Vakarattamsadhatu-Antassa.

It, together with the final of the root, is changed into ca-vagga, ya and va. 

The suffix 'ya' indicatiang bhava and kamma becomes ca-vagga, 'ya' and 'va' together with the final of the root as the case may be. Moreover, is to be taken by sihagati. And that is in the sense of vavatthitavibhasa. By that :-
" 'Ca' and 'ta' vagga-s occuring as the finals of roots become ca-vagga-s. The sounds 'ra' and 'va' together with the suffixes become 'ya' and 'va' respectively." 
When the sound 'ca' is applicable as the final of the root belongs to ca-vagga, the sound 'ca' becomes double by the rule 'paradvebhavo thane' (28-40). Paccate odano devadattena (Rice is being cooked by Devadatta). 

By the rule 'kvaci dhatu' etc. (517-472), it is changed into 're' in the pathamapurisa plural after the short vowel being preceded by garu. Paccare, paccante, paccase, paccavhe, pacce, paccamhe. When the parassapadasubstitute is applicable :- Paccati paccanti, paccasi,paccatha, pacccami paccama. Similarly, in the passive sense and active sense :- paccate odano sayarh eva (Rice is being cooked by itself only), paccante, paccati or paccanti etc. After the root 'gama' when the suffix 'ya' is applied in attanopada in the passive sense :- The words 'dhatuhi', 'tasmim' and 'ye' are understood :-

## (442-432) Ivann-Agamo Va.

The 'i'-vanna is optionally augmented When the suffix 'ya' indicating bhava and kamma follows, the 
'i-vanna' is optionally augmented after all roots. TTius, the sound 'i' is augmented. The word 'va' is in the sense of vavatthitavibhasa. Ccha-substitute is applicable.

## (443-433) Pubbarupaii-Ca.

And the form of the preceding (consonant is laid down). 

This rule is applicable after the roots which are not referred to above. 

By that, the suffix 'ya' after the roots ending in ka, a ta, pa-vagga-s, ya, la, and sa only, is changed into the form of the preceding consonant. 

By the force of va after the sound 'ma', the suffix 'ya' becomes 'ma'. 

Gammate, gamiyate, gammante, gamiyante, gammase, gamiyase, gammavhe, gamiyavhe, gamme, gamiye, gammamhe, gamiyamhe. Now, when it is parassapada :- gacchiyyati gacchiyyanti or gacchiyati gacchiyanti. gammati gammanti. gamiyati gamiyanti. When the sound 'i' is augmented :- gamiyyati gamiyyanti. Similarly, ghammiyati ghammiyanti etc. 

(Here ends) the vattamana vibhatti. 

(424-434) Pancami tu antu hi tha mi ma, tarn antarii ssu vho e amhase. 

Tu, antu, hi, tha, mi, ma, tarn,, antam, ssu, vho, e, amhase are called 'paficami' (suffixes). 

The twelve (vibhatti) beginning with 'tu' etc. are called 'pancami'. 

## (415-435) Anatti-Asiihsatthe Anutta-Kale Pancami.

The paficami terminations are used in the sense of command and blessing when time is 'anutta'. 

When time is 'anutta' the pancami - suffix is applicable in the sense of command and blessing. Even, when 'kala' is governing, the word 'kala' has occured again. By that pancami - vibhatti is applicable in the sense of vidhi, nimantana, ajjhesana, anumati, patthana, pattakala etc. Anatti means ordering. Asimsa means blessing. And that asimsittha means a desired thing which is not obtained. Thus, anatthasiriisatthe means in those 'anatti' and 
'asimsattha'. 'Anuttakala' means the time which is expressed in one's vicinity 
(anu). That is 'paccuppannakala'. Or, the time which is not referred to is 'anuttakala'. In that 'anuttakala' means when the time does not concern. In this context, the pancami termination 'tu; third person, singular is used after the root 'bhu' in the sense of asiriisana (blessing). The suffix 'a', vuddhi and ava-substitute are applicable. So sukhi bhavatu (May he be happy), te sukhita bhavantu (May they be happy). The word 'akarato' from the rule 'akaro dighaih himimesu' (478-422), is understood by modification in the following :-

## (479-436) Hi Lopaih Va.

The termination 'hi' is optionally elided. 

After the sound 'a', the suffix 'hi' is optionally elided. Tvam sukhi bhava or bhavahi (May you be happy). Lengthening is applicable when 'hi' follows. Tumhe sukhita bhavatha (May you be happy), aham sukhi bhavami (May I be happy), mayaih sukhino bhavama (May we be happy).

applied because the word 'va' is understood as continued Further, the intransitive roots become transitive when the causal suffix is applied And the transitive roots would take two objects. The roots having two objects become tikammaka (having three objects) when karita-suffix follows. Therefore, the akhyata terminations may possibly be used in active or passive sense. It is not possible in bhava. And 'suddhakatta' is called kamma in the contex of karita. The padhanakamma of the roots 'ni' etc. the appadhanakamma of the roots 'duha' etc. and suddhakatta are to be treated as objects belonging to the verbs in the causal use." 
In this context, whosoever is becoming, to him other person says, 
'you become ! you become !.' Or another person inspires one to prosper when he has potentiality of prospering. Or, he causes to be. In this sense the suffixes ne and naya are laid down by this rule. Also the technical term karita is laid down for these suffixes. The vakya is not used by (paribhasa) 'vuttatthanam appayogo'. The sound *na' is elided by the rule â€¢karitanarh no looam' C523-5101 The vuddhi 'o' for the vowel 'u' is applicable by the rule 'asamyogantassa vuddhi karite' (483-511). The words 
'o' and 'e' are continued and the word 'dhatu' is understood in the follwing:-

## (515-525) Te Av-Aya Karite.

When a karita-suffix follows, those are changed into 'ava' and *aya'. 

When a karita-suffix follows, those vowels 'o' and 'e' belonging to the final of the root are changed into ava and aya. The roots 'jhe' etc. are changed into 'aya' even in non-karita suffix by yogavibhaga from 'te avaya'. Thus, the vowel 'o' is changed into 'ava'. Saralopa etc. are applicable. The terminations 'ti' etc. are applied by the rule 'dhatuppaccayehi vibhattiyo' (455-511). So samadhiih bhaveti / bhavayati (He cultivates the cocaitration.), bhaventi / bhavayanti, bhavesi / bhavayasi, bhavetha / bhavayatha, bhavemi / bhavayami, bhavema / bhavayama, bhavayate / bhavayante. In the passive sense :- the attanopada, the suffix 'ya', the i-augment and saralopa etc. are applicable. Tena bhaviyate samadhi (The concentration is being cultivated by him.), bhavlyante, bhaviyati bhaviyanti.

In the passive sense :- bhaviyeyya bhaviyeyyum. 

In ajjattanlvibhatti : - the sound 'sa' is augmented even after a karita 
^ding in long vowel by yogavibhaga from 'sattaih ajjattanimhi' (491-507) 
abhavayimsu / bhavayirhsu, abhavayurh / bhavayum, abhavesi / bhavesi, abhavittha / abhavayittha, abhavesim / bhavesirh, abhavayirfi / bhavayiih, abhavimha / abhavayimha.

In the passive sense :- bhaviyissate bhaviyissante, bhaviyissati bhaviyissanti. Abhavissa / abhavayissa, abhavissarfisu / abhavayissamsu. In the passive sense :- abhaviyissatha, abha^ayissa etc. 

Similarly, whosoever is cooking, to him the other person says 'you cook ! you cook !' or other person inspires one to cook or he causes to cook. In this sense according to the previous process, the suffixes ne, naya etc. are to be applied. The lengthening ('a' for 'a') is applicable. 

The remaining process is the same. So devadattam odanam paceti (He makes Devadatta to cook rice.), pacenti, pacesi pacetha, pacemi pacema; pacayati pacayanti, pacayasi pacayatha, pacayami pacayama. However in the case of the suffixes nape and napaya :- so puriso tarn purisam odanam pacapeti (That man makes that person cook rice), pacapenti, pacapayati pacapayanti. In the passive sense : so odanam paciyati (He makes the rice cooked), tena pacayiyati (The rice is being made cooked by him.), pacapiyati pacapayiyati. 

Similarly, pacetu / pacayatu, pacapetu / pacapayatu, paciyataih paciyatu, pacayiyatam pacaylyatu, pacapiyatam pacaplyatu, pacapayiyatam pacapayiyatu, pacepeyya / pacayeyya, pacayeyya / pacapayeyya, paciyeyya paciyeyyuih, apacesi / pacayi, apacapesi apacapayi, pacessati / pacayissati. 

pacapessati / pacapayissati, apacissa / apacayissa, apacapissa / apacapayissa etc. To indicate the meaning : 'He impels one who is going' or 'He impels one to go', the suffixes ne and naya are applicable. When lengthening is applicable :- The rule 'asariiyogantassa vuddhi karite' (483-511) is understood. 

## (484-526) Ghatadinaih Va.

(The vuddhi) of the roots 'ghata' etc. (is applicable) optionally. 

When a karita-suffix follows, the roots 'ghata' etc. not ending in conjuncts are optionally lengthened The lengthoiing is not applicable by the word 'va' in tiiis rule. The word 'va' is in the sense of vavatthitavibhasa. So tarn purisaiii gamaih gameti / gamayati (He makes that man to go to the village.), gacchapeti / gacchapayati, so gamaih gamiyati (He is being made to go to the village.), gamayiyati tena, gacchapiyati gacchapayiyati etc. This process should be applied everywhere. Similarly, even in the 
(context ol) further (terminations). 

The root 'ghata' is used in the sense of 'iha' (attempt). Ghatantaih payojayati (He impels one who is attempting), ghateti. The vuddhi is not applicable by the rule 'ghata-dinaih va' (the present rule). Ghatayati ghatapeti ghatapayati. The word 'karita' is understood in the following :-

## (486-527) Guha-Dusanaih Digharii.

(The vowels) of the roots guha and dusa become long. When a karita-suffix follows, the vowels of the roots guha and dusa beccMne long. This rule is for laying down an exception to vuddhi. The root 'guha' is used in the sense of restraining. Guhayati means 'one causes to restrain', guhayanti. The root 'dusa' is used in the sense of hatred Dusayati means one encourages the hater, dusayanti etc.

"The karita-suffixes may be applied even after the verbal suffixes. And in this context, it is indicated that the suffixes 'yu' and 'nvu' are found even after causd forms." 
By that, in the sense of 'one encourages the tolerant' we have titikkheti / titikkhapeti; tikiccheti / tikicchayati means one causes to cure, tikicchapeti / tikicchapayati; similarly, bubhukkheti bubhukkhayati, bubhukkhapeti bubhukkhapayati; pabbatayati means one encourages some one who behaves like a mountain.

(Here ends) the process of the words ending in the dhatu-paccaya-s. 

"According to my knowledge, 1 have taught the Akhyata topic for the (buddha) sasana. The clever ones may think over it with their power of learning. An expert in the characteristics of kamma, should know *bhavati titthati,* seti ahosi, etc. as intransitive verbs. Even intransitive ones ending in the hetu-suffixes should be known as transitive ones. For example, 'a monk cultivates (bhaveti) 
the path which removes passion etc.' "
