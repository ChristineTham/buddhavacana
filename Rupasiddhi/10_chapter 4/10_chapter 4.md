# Samasakanda (The Chapter On Compound)

Now, samasa is based on nouns, because samasa is made of nouns connected with each other. Moreover, samasa itself has the characteristic of a noun. Therefore, 'samasa' is being told after nouns. And from the point of view of nomenclatures (saiiiia) it is sixfold :- i) abyaylbhava, ii) kammadharaya, iii) digu, iv) tappurisa, v) bahubbihi and vi) dvandva. In this context, firstly, the abyayibhava samasa is being told. And that is niccasamasa; so its analysis can not be done by its own pada-s. Regarding 
'upa-nagararh', after the word 'upa' the nominative singular case-ending 'si' is applied. That (case-ending) is preceded by upasagga, therefore, it is dropped by the rule 'sabbasam avuso-upasagganipatadihi ca' (221-282). After the word 'nagara', the genitive singular case-ending 'sa' is applied. When by using external word, the analysis is done as : nagarassa samipam :-
The rule 'namanarh samaso yuttattho' (316-316), is to be understood everywhere in the process of samasa. 

## (319-315) Upasagganipatapubbako Abyayibhavo.

'Abyayibhava' has upasagga or nipata as first member. 

The noun having combined meaning, preceded by upasagga or nipata, is always compounded with those upasagga or nipata and such a samasa is technically called 'abyayibhava'. Or in this context, the rules laying down the nomenclatures 'abyayibhava' etc. themselves are to be icnown as defining the compounds through the laying down of those nomenclatures. Here, the word 'abyaya' is the technical term for upasagga and nipata. The 
'abyayibhava' is so called because it makes the meaning of abyaya-s clear without changing by the differences in gender and number. Or, abyayibhava means turning the non-abyaya into abyaya, as the sense of abyaya precedes. 

## (316-316) Namanaih Samaso Yuttattho.

The combined sense of nouns is called 'samasa'. 

The combined sense of the meanings of nouns is technically called 
'samasa' (combined sense). The other (combined sense) is known as 'vakyarh'. 'Namas' are the words which end with the case-endings beginning with 'si'. 'Samasa' is so called as it is derived from the verb 'samassate'. 

The meaning of samassate is 'that which abbreviates (saiikhipiyati)'. 

And it is told : -
"Samasa is the abbreviation of padas; Taddhita is the collection of padas & suffix. In this way the difference between them should be understood." 
And, the compounding in the case of samasa is twofold i) the compounding of words and ii) the compounding of meanings. In luttasamasa both these compoundings are found completely. But in 'aluttasamasa' only the compounding of meanings is found because the vibhatti-suffixes are not dropped Or even in that, both compoundings are found because there also both the padas go to the state of a single pada. For, the purpose of a samasa is twofold : i) to make a single pada and ii) a single case-suffix. 

'Yuttattha' means combined sense. Or, 'yutta' means connected relation. That is the meaning of which, it is 'yuttattha'. By this, 'yuttattha' means 
'combined meaning'. Therefore, the definition of samasa is told as 
'bhinnatthanarh ekatthibhava' (bringing different meanings into one). 

Moreover, in this context, by the expression 'namanaih' it is shown that in the sentences like 'devadatto pacati etc' 'samasa' is not made with the verb. When, however, the word 'yuttattha' is taken in the sense of connection, it is shown that samasa is not formed in the following : i) bhato ranno putto devadattassa etc. and ii) devadattassa kanha danta etc. 

In the first expression the words have no expectancy with each other. In the second, the whole expression expects some other word, as the meaning is not properly applied. As 'the case terminations are changed according to meaning,' the word 'yuttatthanam' modified (from 'yuttattha') is understood :-

## (317-317) Tesaih Vibhattiyo Lopa Ca.

And their case-endings are dropped. In this context, 'yuttattha' means tumed into single sense by means of another pada, or taddhita suffixes or the suffixes *aya' etc. By that, the case-ending of those 'yuttattha', compounds and nouns ending in the suffixes of taddhita and aya etc. are dropped. But when the word 'samasa' is governing, or by the force of the word 'tesam', the vibhatti-endings of taddhita-s and the words ending with the suffixes aya etc. are dropped. The word 'ca' is used in order to cancel the elision in 'pabhankaro' etc. By modification, the words 'luttesu vibhattisu' are continued. And the word 
'yuttattha' is understood :-
(318-318) Pakati ca assa sarantassa. 

(Such a word) ending in a vowel assumes primitive form. When the case-endings have been ehded, the words ending in vowels, belonging to the three genders, having the combined sense assumes the basic fonn. By the word 'ca', also the niggahita assumes pakatibhava in kiihsamudaya, idampaccayata, etc. As the absense of nemittaka is not certain, even if there is the absence of nimitta, in this context, we have atidesa. The designation 'nama' is extended as there is absence of the state of a linga for a samasa-pada as it has not its own basic meaning and therefore the application of case-endings does not occur. (So in the following :-). 

(601-319) Taddhita-samasa-kitaka namainv-atave-tuna-adisu ca, 
(Words ending in) taddhita, samasa and kita suffixes are regarded as nouns, except the suffixes tave, tuna etc. 

The samasa and the words ending in taddhita and kita suffixes except tave, tuna, tva etc. are to be considered like nama. The word 'ca' is used to indicate that even the words ending in kiccapaccayas and itthipaccayas are called 'nama'. The other (grammarians) have told that in this context, the word 'samasa' is used to indicate that the definition of nama as 'the collection of meaningfiil (padas)' is applicable only to the samasas. The word 'abya>ibhavo' is understood in the following :-

## (320-320) So Napuihsaka-Lihgo.

That (abyajibhava) has neuter gender. The 'abyayibhavasamasa' is to be regarded as neuter only. Thus, the state of having the neuter gender is accompUshed. For in this context, when the 'atidesa' of gender is available, in the forms like 'adhipannaih' etc. the calamity of becoming adhinanam does not occur; because it would be a different word. It is to be considered as the forms like 'tipannaih' etc. And the 'atidesa' is not applicable because the word 'iva' indicating atidesa does not appear in the nile. 'Si' etc. are applied as before. The word 'kvaci' is to be understood in the following :-
(341-321) Am vibhattinaih akaranta abyayibhava. 

The case-endings (are changed into) 'am' after 'a' ending abyayibhava. After that a-ending abyayibhava, the case-endings sometimes are changed into 'am'. The process is as usual. Tarn upanagaram i. e. it is situated near the city, tani upanagarani. Similarly, also in the locative case, tarn upanagaram passa (you see that which is near city), tani iq)anagaiam. 

"Due to the governing 'kvaci', 'am' is not applicable in the ablative *cast.* But 'aiti' is optionally applicable for instrumental, locative and genitive cases." 
Taia upanagaram or iq)anagarena katam. tehi upanagaram or upanagarehi. tassa upanagaram dehi. tesam upanagaram. upanagara anaya, upanagaramha, iqianagarasma. upanagarehi. tassa upanagararh santakam, or upanagarassa, tesam upanagaram, or upanagaranaih. upanagaram nidhehi, upanagare or upanagaramhi, upanagarasmim. upanagaiath, or upanagaresu. 

Similarly, upakumbhaih. In the sense of 'abhava' (absence) :- niddaratharh means without anxiety, nimmasakaih. In the sense of 'paccha' (after) :-
anurupaih means suitable to the form. In the sense of 'viccha' (repetition):-
paccattam means individual, anvaddhamasam means every fortnight, twice a month. In the sense of 'anupubba' (successive) :- anujettharh means according to seniority. In the sense of 'patiloma' (against) :- patisotam means against the stream, patipathaih, pativatam; ajjhattarh means that which is personal. In the sense of 'mariyada' and 'abhividhi' :- aoanakotikam means upto the end of life. The suffix 'ka' is applied by the rule 'kvaci samasa' ntogatanaih akaianto' (294-335). a kumarehi yaso akumaram, yaso kaccayanassa. In the sense of 'samiddhi' (accomplishment) :- when the compound is formed in the sense of 'accomplishment of alms' and when the state of neuter is applied - when the expression 'samasassa anto' is applicable :-

## (342-322) Saro Rasso Napuihsake.

The short vowel is (laid down) in neuter gender. 

The final vowel of samasa having the neuter gender becomes short Moreover, in this context, the word 'abyayibhava' should not be taken as continued By that even in digu, dvandva and bahubbihi, the shortening of the final vowel of samasa having the neuter gender is accomplished. 

By the rule 'aril vibhatfinarti etc,' (341-321), the 'arii' substitute is applicable, subhikkharii. Upagangarii means it is near the ganga river, upamanikarii means near the waterpot When, in the sense of 'in connection with women', compounding, neuter state, shortening etc. are done :- The word abyajibhava and vibhattinam are applicable :-

## (343-323) Aniiasma Lopo Ca.

After the other (abyayibhavasamasas), also the elision is applicable. The case-endings after the abyayibhava samasa-s not ending in 'a' are also elided adhitthi : the meaning is the talk is 'about women', adhitthi passa, adhitthi katarh etc. Similarly, adhikumari; 'upavadhu' means near the young girl, 'upagu' means near the cows, the shortening of the sound 'o' is 'u'. In this manner, the abyayibhava, when the first member is upasagga. 

should be known. When the first member is a nipata as :- â€¢yathavuddham' means sequence of elders, or according to elders; yathakkamarh in the sense of, 'not transgresing the sequence' :- yathasatti or yathabalaih means 'he is doing according to his power', yavajivarh means as long as life lasts, similarly, yavatayukarh, the suffix 'ka' is applied. Yavadattham means as far as one likes, tiropabbatam means beyond the other side of mountain, tiropakaram, tirokuddarh, antopasadarh means within the palace, antonagaraih, antovassam, bahinagaiaih means outside the city, iq)aripasadaih means the upper story of a palace, uparimancaih, hetthamancam means undemeath the bed, hetthapasadam, purebhattam means before meals, similarly, pacchabhattam. In the sense of whole, entire :- 'samakkhikaih' means '(he eats) entire (lit) together with fly, the meaning is he does not leave anything; by the rule 'tesu vuddhi etc' (362-355), the 'sa-substitute' for the word 'saha' is applied Oragangam means this (lower) side of gaAga etc. 

$${\mathfrak{M}}.$$

The abyayibhavasamasa is over. 

Now, the kammadharaya samasa is being told :- And that is ninefold as : i) visesanapubbapada, ii) visesanuttarapada, iii) visesanobhayapada, iv) 
upamanuttarapada, v) sambhavanapubbapada, vi) avadharanapubbapada, vii) 
nipatapubbapada, viii) kupubbapada, and ix) padipubbapada. In this context, regarding visesanapubbapada firstly, mahanta + purisa, the nomiative singular case-ending 'si' is applied to the both; the application of the word 'ca' and 'ta' is to denote noun in aposition (same case). Now, when the analysis is done :- mahanto ca so puriso ca :- Further, the word 'vibhasa' fi-om the rule 'vibhasa rukkhatina etc' (323-345), is understood everywhere in the process of samasa. 

## (324-324) Dvipade Tulya-Adhjkarane Kammadharayo.

In the context of two words having the same case, kammadharaya 
(is laid down). 

The two nominal words having the same case are combined with each other optionally. And when two words used in the same case, are compKHjnded, that compound is called 'kammadharaya'. Dvipadarh meÂ£ins two padas, that pair of padas the meaning of which is in equal adhikarana; in that pair of padas means tulyadhikarafle, 'tulyadhikaranata' means action in a single meaning through the relation of 'visesana' and 'visesitabba', on the part of two padas having originally different pavatti-nimittas. Kammadharaya means that which holds the both as kamma. It holds the pair, action and purpose that is â€¢kamma', because action and purpose are possible whai object exists. Therefore, this compound holds two nouns having the single meaning, because that compound is possible when the pair of nouns indicates the single meaning. Samasasaiina, vibhattilopa and pakatibhava are applicable as Wore. As 'tulyadhikarana' is told by that samasa Mily, the word 'ca' and 'ta' are not applied by 'vuttatthanaih appayogo'. 

## (330-325) Mahataih Maha Tulyadhikarane Pade.

Whai a word in the same case follows, mahata (plural) changes to 'maha'. 

The word mahanta is changed into 'maha', when the uttarapada having the same case follows. By the plural form 'mahatarh', sometimes, the substitute 'maha' is also applicable. Moreover, in this context, as herein the substitute maha of the adjectival preceding pada is laid down, it is indicated that the abjective precedes (in this compound). The words 
'kammadharayo' and 'digu' are to be understood in the following :-

## (326-326) Ubhe Tappurisa.

The both are called 'tappurisa'. Both descriptive compound and numeral compound are called 
'tappurisa'. The man of that (king) is called tappurisa. This compound is also called 'tappurisa' technically having similarity to the word tappurisa. Just as the word tappurisa has the preceding member as an abjective similarly this compound also. For, the tappurisa has the meaning of the uttarapada as its major member. After that, the term of nama is appUcable, (and) 
'si' etc. are applied. The tappurisa, however, possesses the number of the abhidheyya and the gender of the final member. The forms mahapuriso, mahapurisa etc. are similar to those of the word purisa. Similarly, mahaviro, mahamuni. 'mahabalam' means great power, mahabbhyaih :- here the maha-substitute is applicable, sappuriso means good person. By the word 
'ca' in the rule 'santasaddassa so bhe bo cante etc' (185-112), even in samasa when there is not the sound 'bha' the sa-substitute of the word 
'santa' is applicable. Similarly, pubbapuriso, parapuriso, pathamapuriso, majjhimapuriso, uttamapuriso, dantapuriso, paramapuriso, virapuriso, setahatthipuriso, kanhasappo, nili^palam, setuppalam, rattuppalam, lohitacandanam. Sometimes, the compound is not formed due to the governing 'vibhasa'. For example :- punno mantaniputto, citto gahapati. 

sakko devaraja. Now, when the compound is made in the sense of 'male cuckoo', the word 'loparh' is understood :-

## (222-327) Pumassa Lihgadisu Samasesu.

(The final) of the word 'puma* (is dropped) in the compounds having the words linga etc. (as para-padas). 

The final sound 'a' of the word 'puma' is elided when the compounds having the words 'linga' etc. as parapadas are formed. The sound 'ma' is changed into niggahita by the rule 'am o niggahitam jhalapehi' (82-149). 

punkokilo. Similarly, punnago. Whai the dissolution 'khattiya girl' is tumed into compound : The mles 'tulyadhikarane pade' (330-325) and 'itthiyambhasitapumitthi pumava ce' (331-338) are applied :-

## (332-328) Kammadharaya-Saniie Ca.

Also in the (samasa) technically called 'kammadharaya'. 

And in the compound called 'kammadharaya', when the feminine uttarapada follows in the same case, the preceding word indicating feminine gender, if it is used in masculine in the language should be known as having masculine gender. The itthipaccaya becomes non-applicable to the preceding pada. 

Khattiyakanna, khattiyakaniiayo etc. Similarly, rattalata, dutiyabhikkha. 

Brahmanadarika means a brahmin girl. Similarly, nagamanavika. The 'atidesa' of the state of masculine is applicable only to the preceding word. By that in the uttarapadas of khattiyakumarl, Kumarasamani, tanmabrahmani, the itthipaccaya is not forbidden. Why 'itthiyam' ? For we have :- kumariratanam, samanlpadumam. Why bhasitapuma ? For we have :- ganganadi, tanhanacU, pathavidhatu. However, in the words nandapokkhaiani, nandadevi etc. pumabhava is not found because they are proper nouns. 

Similarly, puratthimakayo means ejistem part of body, then, in this context, the word 'kaya' is used with reference to particular body. Similarly, pacchimakayo, hetthimakayo, uparimakayo, sabbakayo, puranaviharo, navavaso, kataranikayo, katamanikayo, hetupaccayo. Bahulikatam means multiplied that which was not multiplied Jivitanavakam means the nine forms begiiming with life; and so on. 

Now, regarding 'visesanuttarapada' :- The visesana i.e. thera, acariya, pandita etc. is to be used as the latter member keeping with the usages made by the conqueror; as :- sariputtatthero means the thera called Sariputta, similarly, mahamoggallanatdiero, mahakassapatdiero, buddhaghosacariyo, dhammapalacariyo, or acariyaguttilo. Mahosadhapandito means the wise one called Mahosadha; similarly, vidhurapandito, vatthuviseso. Now, regarding the 'visesanobhayapada' as :- situnham means cold and hot, siniddhunho maso means moist and hot bean, khanjakhujjo means lame and humpback, similarly, andhabadhiro, katakata, chiddavachidda, uccavacaih, chinnabhinnarii, sittasammattham, gatapaccagatam. 

In upamanuttarapada :- the visesana used as upamana is put latter according to the usage of that noun as :- 'munisiho' :- unique as a lion; one who is a sage and also unique like a lion; similarly, munivasabho, munipumgavo, buddhanago, buddhadicco, saddhammaramsi :- ray as ray; righteous dhamma as well as (like) ray; similarly, vinayasagaro; samanapundariko :- white lotus as white lotus; one who is a sage as a white lotus, similarly, samanapadumo. mukhacando :- moon as the moon; that which is face as well as moon, similarly, mukhapadumam etc. 

Now, the sambhavanapubbapada as :- dhammabuddhi means religioiis intelligence, similarly, dhammasanna, dhammasankhato, dhammasammato, panasannita, asubhasanna, aniccasaiina, anattasanna, dhatiisanna, dhitusanna, attasanna, atthisanna, attaditthi etc. The avadhaianapubbapada as :- gunadhanam means virtue itself is wealth, similarly, saddhadhanam, siladhanam, pannaratanarh; cakkhundriyaih means eye itself is the sense organ, similarly, cakkhayatanam, cakkhudhatu, cakkhudvaiam, ruparammanaih etc. The nipatapubbapada as :- when the kammadharaya compound is foraied in the sense of 'non-brahmin', and when vibhattilopa etc. are applied, the temi of tappurisa is applicable by the rule 'ubhe tappurisa'. 

## (333-329) Attain Nassa Tappurise.

In tappurisa 'na' acquires the state of 'a'. When the uttarapada in tappurisa compound follows, the entire 'na' becomes 'a'. It is tappurisa because of belonging to a type of Tappurisa. abrahm^o. 

"The negation of existance is not justified without the limits like place etc. Moreover, refusal of non-existance is useless. Therefore, how the expression 'a-brahmano' is justified ? Sometimes patisedhavidhi is justified in order to explain through the anuvada of prohibition when the other person has ignorance." 
By way of pasajjapatisedha and pariyudasa, this has double meaning. 

In this regard : when the significance of uttarapada does not exist at all, in the examples like â€¢asuriyaiiipassa rajadara etc. that is called pasajjappatisedha-vidhi. Furthennore, the pariyudasavaci means having prevented the significance of uttarapada, the action is indicated in connection with similar matter, as in abrahmanamanavo etc. And it is told that :-
"The absence of a thing is the characteristic of 'pasajjappatisedha'. The reference to other than the thing is the characteristic of 'pariyudasa". 

Now, even if such is the case, how in the words like 'abrahmano' etc. there would be prominance of uttarapada ? It is told :- Because the words brahmana etc. denote also ttie significance of the similar entities like the significance 'brahmana' etc. The words 'brahmana' etc. basically are entirely expressive of the significance 'brahmana' etc. only. When, however, they are associated with die nipata 'na' indicating similar etc., at that time they are also used in the sense of taiiisadisa (similar to that), tadaniia (odier dian that), tabbiruddha (different from that), and tadabhava (nothing of that), as the word 'bhu' to be, associated with anu, abhi etc. is used in the sense of anubhavana, abhibhavana etc. Therefore, there is not feult Therefore, by the expression 'abrahmana' one similar with brahmana is indicated Similarly, amanusso, assamano. 

In the significance aiina :- abyakata means dhammas which are not explained, asaihkilittha, apariyapanna. In the significance viruddha : - akusala means not meritorious, the significance is opposite of merit. Similarly, alobho, amitto. In the meaning of pasajjappatisedha :- akatva means having not done, akatuna; pufinam akaronto means not performing merit The words nassa and tappurisa are understood in the following :-

## (334-330) Sare Ana.

(The change into) 'ana' (is laid down) when a vowel follows. WhOT a vowel follows, in tappurisa compound the word 'na' becomes 
*ana'; 'anasso' means that which is not horse, anariyo means that who is not Ariya; similarly, anissaro, anit^ho, anasavo, anupavado; anadaya means not having taken, anoloketva etc. Now, regarding the compound having *ka' as pubbapada as :- when due to niccasamasa by using external word, the analysis is done as 'kucchitaih annaih' (bad food), to form a kammadharayasamasa : The words tappurisa and sare are understood :-

## (335-331) Kadaiii Kussa.

'Ku' changes into 'kada'. In tappurisa compound the nipata 'ku' is changed into 'kada', when a vowel follows. Sara-lopa is applicable, kadannaih; similarly, kadasanam. 

Why the word sare is understood ? For, we have the forms kudara, kuputta, kudasa, kuditthi. The word 'kussa' is understood :-

$\downarrow$  . 
$\textbf{i}$ppatches. 
$\mathbb{Z}$). 

## (336-332) Ka Appatthesu Ca.

Also (ku) changes into 'ka' in diminutives. The word 'ku' being used in the sense of diminutive becomes 'ka', 
if uttarapada follows in a tappurisa compound. And because of the plural, used in the rule, sometimes, in tappurisa compound, 'ka' used in the sense of kucchita becomes 'ka'. Kalavanam means Uttle salt; similarly, kapupham; kapuriso or kupuriso (contemptible man). 

And the compound having 'pa' etc. as initial word is 'niccasamasa' only, pavacanam means fundamental teaching, pabaddhaih sarirarh means very strong body, samadhanam means putting balance or correcdy, vimati means double mind, vikappo mens different ideas, or specific thought, adhidevo means supreme god; similarly, adhisilaih; sugandho means good smell, duggandho means bad smell, sukatam means good doing, dukkatath means wrong doing etc. Here, those of nouns, upasaggas and nipatas the charecteristics of which arc not laid down should be understood to foim 
'samasas' by the yogavibhaga 'namanaih samaso' (273-316) as, 'samasa' is not formed with another word in 'apunageyya gatha, acandamullokikani mukhani, assaddhabhoji, alavanabhojl etc. in order to avoid ayuttattha. 

Similarly, ditthapubbo tathagatam means one who has seen the Tathagata before; similarly, sutapubbo dhammam, gatapubbo maggaih. In the case of kamma (object) :- ditthapubba tena means the gods are seen by him before, similarly, sutapubba dhamma, gatapubba disa, paharo, parabhavo, viharo, aharo, iqiaharo etc. 

(Here ends) the kammadharaya compound Now, digusamasa is being told. In the sense of 'tayo loka samahata cittena sampindita; 'three worlds having brought means collected by mind' or 'the collection of the three worlds'. When the rule 'namanaih samaso yuttattho' (273-316) is applicable, by the rule 'dvipade etc.' the kammadharayasamasa is formed. After diat when the nomenclature 'samasa' is applicable, the elision of vibhatti and pakatibhava are made. Then die word 'kammadharaya' is to be understood :-

## (325-333) Sahkhyapubbo Digu.

(Compound) having a numeral as a first member is called 'digu'. The kammadharaya samasa having numeral as a first member is technically called 'digu'. The word 'digu' means two cows. This compound also is called 'digu' because it is similar to the word 'digu'. Or 'digu' is so called because of having become understood (gata & avagata) by two definitions, namely i) having a numeral as a first member ii) neuter, singular. Or 'digu' is so called because that goes (becomes active) by two characteristics. Now, in this context, as the word 'sankhyapubbo' is used pubbanipata is applicable only to the word indicating numeral. The technical term tappurisa is applied by the rule 'ubhe tappurisa' (283-326). The word 
'napmhsakalingo' (227-320), is understood :-

## (323-334) Digussa Ekattarii.

Singularity of EHgu (is laid down). 

The numerical compound is singular and neuter. Here, the word digu stands for samahara digu. Therein always singular is applicable, but in the compounds other than samaharadigu, even the plural also is applicable. After the term 'nama' is applied, 'si' etc. are applied and the process of substitution 'am' etc. also becomes applicable, "tilokaih; he tiloka; tilokarti; tilokena; tilokassa or tilokaya; tiloka tilokamha tilokasma; tilokassa; tiloke tilokamhi tilokasmim". Similarly, 'tidandarh' means the collection of three sticks, timalaih means three malas brought together or collection of three malas, tilakkhanam, catusaccam; catuddisaih means the four directions; Shortening is applied by the rule 'saro rassaih napumsake' (299-322). 

pancasikkhapadaih, chalayatanaih, sattaham, atthasilaih, navalokuttaraih, dasasilaih, satayojanaih. Similarly, dvirattam means two nights, tirattam means three nights, dvangulam means two fingers, tivangulam, sattagodhavaram means seven godhavaris or their collection. Moreover, in this context, the final of the words ratti, anguli and godhavari : -
(337-335) Kvaci samasa-antagatanarii akaranto. 

(The final) of the last members in compounds sometimes changes into *a'. 

This rule is applicable to the words raja etc. By that, the final vowel of nouns raja etc. which are the last members in compounds sometimes, becomes 'a'. Thus, the sound *a' is applicable. By the word 'kara', in the final of bahubbihi compound etc. the suffix *ka' sometimes is applied. And the sound 'i' is substituted for the final of gandha after the words surabhi, su, du, and puti. Or, 'aka' means 'a' and 'ka', the sound 'ra' is conjunct-consonant By that, for, the final of the last members in compounds sometimes, the suflfixes 'a' and 'ka' are applicable. By that, in the sense of 'five cows are brought', when the process of compounding etc. is done, the suffix 'a' in the final of compound is applied and the 
'ava'-substitute is made by the rule 'o sare ca' (471-435). The words 'paiicagavam' etc. are accomplished. However, in 'dvirattam' etc. when the suffix 'a' is made, by the rule 'sare lopo' (83-67) etc. the elision of the preceding vowel is applicable. Now, regarding 'asamaharadigu' as :-
ekapuggalo means one person; similarly, ekadhammo, ekaputto; tibhava means three existances, catuddisa means four directions, sahassacakkavalani etc. 

(Here ends) Digusamasa Now, tappurisa samasa is being told That, however, is basickllyv^ 
sixfold in the six-case-endings beginning with the accusative. Among thenv dutiyatappurisa samasa is fomied with the words gata, nissita, atita, atikkanta, patta, apanna etc. When the analysis is done as : saranarh gato:- The word 'tappuriso' is to be understood :-

## (327-336) Aih-Adayo Parapadebhi. 

![17_Image_0.Png](17_Image_0.Png)

(The case-endings) 'am' etc. (are combined) with the succeeding words. 

The proper pubbapadas ending in case suffixes am etc. are combined with the following nouns optionally. That compound is called 'tappurisa'. 

And this tappurisa has number and gender of the abhidheyya. The words 
'gata' etc. have three genders because they end in kita-suffixes. All operations of vibhatti-lopa etc. are like previous injunctions. So saranagato 
(he has taken refuge), te saranagata (they have taken refuge), sa saranagata 
(she has taken refuge), ta saranagatayo (they have taken refuge), tarn kulam saranagatam (that family has taken refuge), tani kulani saranagatani (those femilies have taken refuge) etc. Similarly, arafinagato, bhumigato; dhammanissito means dinged to the dhamma, atthanissito; bhavatito means gone beyond the existence, kalatito; pamanatikkantarh means which surpasses the limitation, lokatikantam, sukhappatto means reached the happiness, dukkhappatto; sotapanno means entered into the stream, nirodhasamapanno, maggapatipanno; ratharulho means got into the chariot; sabbarattisobhano means shining during all nights; muhuttasukham. But in upapadasamasa only the paraphrase is applicable because that is niccasamasa. For example :- kanunakaro means he works, kumbhakaro; atthakamo means he desires attha, dhammakamo; dhammadharo means one who possesses the dhamma, vinayadharo; saccavadi means one whose habit is to speak truth etc. After the final of kita-suffixes tvantu, mana, anta, etc. the 'vakya' only is applicable, because of the governing vavatthitavibhasa. For example:- odanam bhuttava (one who has eaten rice), dhammaih sunamano (listening to dhamma), dhammarh sunanto, katarii karano (making the mat). Alternatively, 
'vakya' is applicable to these because they are not referred to directly. 

The taddhita, samasa and kitaka are referred to (by abhidhana) directly. 

(Here ends) the dutiyatappurisa compound-
Now, regarding the instrumental case :- (the preceding word) is combined with the kitaka words, pubba, sadisa, samuna, kalaha, nipuna, missaka, sakhila etc. Bhuddhabhasito dhammo means the doctrine taught by the Bilightened one, similarly, jinadesito; satthuvannito means praised by the teacher, vinnugarahito means condemned by knowers, vinnuppasattho, issarakatam, sayaitikatam; sukahatarti means brought by parrots, rajahato means killed by the king, rogapllito, aggidaddho, sappadattho, sallaviddho means pierced by an arrow; icchapakato means strengthened by desire, silasampanno means perfect with morality; similarly, sukhasahagatarh, nanasampayuttarh, mittasangaho, piyavippayogo, jatithaddho, gunahino, gunavuddho, catuvaggakaraniyarh, catuvaggadikattabbaiti; kakapeyya nadi means the river full to the brim (when even crows can drink water on the bank) etc.

In the context of 'sanghassa databbam' etc. the samasa is not applicable. 

(Here ends) the catutthitappurisa compound.

Sometimes, the vutti only is applicable. 'Kammajam' means originated from kamma; similarly, cittajarh, utujam, aharajam. In the expression 'pasada patito', the samasa is not applied 
(Here ends) the paiicamitappurisa compound. 

Chatthi tappurisasamasa :- rajaputto means king's son; similarly, rajapuriso, acariyapujako, buddhasavako, buddharupam, jinavacanam, samuddaghoso; dhannarasi means heap of grains, pupphagandho, phalaraso; kayalahuta means lightness of body; marananussati means mindfiillness about death; rukkhamulam; ayopatto means bowl of iron; similarly, suvannakatahaih, paniyathalakam, sappikumbho. When in the sense of 'the king of gods' operation of compoimding etc. are done, the sound 'a' is applicable by the rule 'kvaci samasantanaih akaranto' (337-335). After that, by the rule 'sya ca' (189-113), the state of 'a' is not applicable. Devarajo, devaraja, devarajam, devaraje etc. forms are similar to those of the word 
'purisa'. When, the state of 'a' is not applicable :- devaraja, devarajano etc. froms are similar to those of the word 'raja'. Similarly, devasakho means friend of gods, devasakha, so devasakha or to devasakhano etc. The gender of male is pullinga. Similarly, pumbhavo. The elision of final vowel of 'puma' etc. is applicable. 

Hatthipadam, itthirupam, bhikkhunisangho, jambusakha. Moreover, in this context, by the rule 'kvacadimajjhuttaranam' (403-339), shortening of the sounds 'i' and 'u' in the middle is applicable. By the governing 
'vibhasa', sometimes, only 'vakyam' is applicable. Sahasa kammassa kattaro 
(one who works abruptly), bhinnanam sandhata (the reconciliater of schisms), kappassa tatiyo bhago (the third period of aeon), ya ca pakkhassa atthami 
(that which is the eighth day of fortnight), manussanam khattiyo suratamo 
(warrior is the bravest of all human beings). 

The word 'yuttattha' is necessary only. And we have in this context, bhato raiiiio puriso devadattassa; it is genitive case related with 'bhata'. 

therefore, samasa is not formed because the words have no expectancy with each other (and) because of the state of impropriety. But in 'kosalassa rafino putto' etc. because the expression has expectancy, the state of non-ability does not exist. When, however, expectancy always lies among the related words, compounding is applicable by understanding. For example:- devadattassa gurukulam, bhagavato savakasangho etc. 

(Here ends) chatthitappurisa compound. 

The locative (tappurisa compound) :- rupasaniia means perception in form; similarly, rupasancetana, samsaradukkham; cakkhuvinfianaih means consciousness foimded in eye; dhammarato means engrossed in the doctrine; dhammabhirati, dhammaruci, dhammagaravo; dhammanirutti means the knowledge in dhamma-s; danadhimutti, bhavantarakatam; dassanassado means taste in dassana; araniiavaso means living in the forest; vikalabhojanaih means eating in improper time; kalavassam means rain in time; vanapuppharh means flower in the forest; similarly, vanamahiso, gamasukaro, samuddamaccho, avatakacchapo, avatamanduko, kupamanduko, titthanava; itthidhutto means clever about woman, akkhadhutto; chayasukkho means dried in shadow; afigarapakkarii means cooked in burning coal; carakabaddho.

Bhojane mattannuta, indriyesu guttadvaro, asane nisinno, asane nislditabbarh. 

(Here ends) sattamitappurisa compound. 

Because the expression 'tadanuparodhena' (56-64), is used the preceding word ending with the case-ending 'am' sometimes, is to be put afterwords in the cases like 'accanta' etc. in the tappurisa compound as laid down. For example :- accantam means crossing the end, accantani; ativelo means crossing the vela; the shortening is applicable. Similarly, atimalo means having crossed garland, pattajiviko, apannajiviko.

Pubbanharh means a former period of a day, similarly, sayanham. By the rule 'tesu vuddhilopo etc' (404-355), the 'anha'-substitute for 'aha' is applicable. 

(Here ends) the amadiparatappurisa compound 
'pabhankara' etc. For example :- in the sense of one who makes light, the 'samasa' is applicable by the rule 'amadayo parapadebhi', the nomenclature of samasa is applicable by the rule 'namanam samaso yuttattho' (316-316), after that, when the vibhattilopa is applied by the rule 'tesaih vibhattiyo lopa ca' (317-317), by the force of 'ca' in that context only, the vibhattilopa is not applicable in the preceding word The remaining forms are similar.

(Here ends) the alopatappurisa compound The tappurisa compound is over. 

Now, the bahubblhi samasa is being told And it is ninefold :- i) 
dvipadatulyadhikarana, ii) dvipadabhinnadhikarana, iii) tipada, iv) nanipatapubbapada, v) sahapubbapada, vi) upamanapubbapada, vii) sankhyobhayapada, viii) disantaralattha, and ix) byatiharalakkhana. In this context, bahubblhi having two words in the same case relation is applicable in the senses of six case-endings i. e. kamma etc. In this context, firstly, regarding the sense of accusative :- When the analysis is done as : agata samana imam saiigharamarh :-

## (328-337) Anna-Pada-Atthesu Bahubbihi.

'Bahubbihi' is laid down in the context of meanings of padas other than their own. 

The nouns having proper meanings are optionally combined in the sense other than their own, ending with acusative case-ending etc. together with nominative case always. And that compound is called 'bahubbihi'. 

'Bahubbihi' is he who has much rice. The compound is also called 
'bahubbihi' in order to make the term significant For the bahubbihi has the aiiriapada as the major member. And, this 'bahubbihi' is twofold as 
: i) taggunasanviiiiiana ii) ataggunasanviiiiiana. Among them, when the meaning, being a visesana, is to be taken by the word 'aiiiiapadattha', it is called 'taggunasanviiiiiana' as : 'lambakannam anaya' (bring erne who has long ears). However, when it is not taken like that, it is called 
'ataggunasanviiinana' as : 'bahudhanaiii anaya' (Bring bahudhana). Here, the visesana is to be used as the first member as in the word bahubbihi. 

The remaining process is as before, 'agatasamano samgharamo'. Moreover in this context, the words 'agata' and 'samana' not standing in their own senses, are used in aiiiiapadattha, namely, 'sangharama' which has the meaning of the accusative-case. The other pada 'sangharama' is used after them to indicate just their meaning. Then, the accusative case is not used again because the kammattha is told by the samasa only. And the word 
'imam' is not applicable. Similarly, everywhere. This bahubbihi compoimd also possesses the gender and number of the abhidheyya. 

Similarly, agatasamana savatthi. agatasamanam jetavanarh. 

Patipannaddhiko patho means the way at which the wanderers have reached, abhirulhavanija nava means the boat on which merchants have mounted In this manner, the bahubblhi compound in the sense of 'kamma' is to be understood Now, regarding the bahubblhi in the sense of instrumental as : 
jitindriyo samano means the monk who has conquered sense-faculties, similarly, ditthadhammo, pattadhammo, katakicco; vijitamaro bhagava means the lord who has subdued the devil. Patividdhasabbadhammo. The bahubblhi in the sense of dative as : dinnasuiiko raja means the king whom tax is given. Upanitabhojano samano means the monk to whom food is brought. Upahatabali yakkho means yakkha to whom offering is brought The bahubblhi compound in the sense of ablative as : niggatajano gamo means the village irom which people have departed Nirayo means that from which happiness has gone. Nikkileso means he from whom defilements have gone. Apetavinnano matakayo means the dead body from which consciousness has gone. Apagatabhayabheravo araha means Araha from whom fear and dismay have gone. 

The bahubblhi compound in the sense of genitive as : chinnahattho puriso means the man whose hands are cut off; similarly, paripunnasankappo, khinasavo; vitarago means the person whose passion has gone; dvipado means he who has two feet; dvihattho pato. Tevijyo; catuppado means that who has four feet; pancacakkhu bhagava means the Blessed One who has five eyes. Chalabhifino; shortening is applicable. Navarigarh satthusasanarii, dasabalo, anantafiano; tidasa deva means the gods who have three tenfold measurements (desaparimana). The final of the compound becomes 'a'. In this context, the word 'dasa' is used in numerical sense because of the word 'parimana' used together with it 'Idappaccaya' means these have this cause, kimpabhavo ayam kayo means what is the origination of this body. Vimalo means that the stain of which has gone. Sugandharh candanaih means sandal wood smell of which is good; similarly, susilo, sumukho; duggandharh kunapam means carcase the smell of which is bad; dummano means one whose mind in wicked. Similarly, dussilo, dummukho; tapodhano means he who has wealth in the form of penance; khantibalo means he whose power is forbearance; indanamo means one whose name is Inda. In the words 'chandajata' etc. any of the both pada-s can be put first because adjective and substantive is made according to one's will. The word 
'chandajato' dissolved as 'chando jato assati chandajato' or 'jato chando assati jatachando'. Similarly, sanjatapltisomanasso, pitisomannassasanjato, masajato, jatamaso, chinnahattho, hatthacchinno. When the compound is made after the analysis as 'digha jangha yassa' :- The word 'tulyadhikarane' and 'pade' are understood :-

## (331-338) Itthiyaih Bhasitapumaitthi Puma-Va Ca.

If a feminine word follows a masculine word, it takes masculine gender if the word is used in masculine in the language. 

When a pada in the same case in feminine follows, if the feminine word used as masculine in the language precedes, it should be understood as masculine; thus, the itthipaccaya is not applicable in pubbapada. This example belongs to bahubbihi because of the rule 'kammadharayasafine ca' 
(332-328), being referred to before. 

(403-339) Kvaci adi-majjh-uttaranaih digharassa paccayesu ca. 

And when the suffixes follow, the initial, middle and final (vowels) 
are sometimes, lengthened (or) shortened. 

And when the suffixes follow or not, the initial, middle and final vowels are sometimes lengthened or shortened keeping with the usages made by the Conquerer, in the words i.e. taddhita, samasa, nama, upasagga etc. 

In this context :-
"The lengthening is applicable in the words 'pakata', 
anupaghata and madhuva etc. The shortening is applicable in the words 'ajjava', 'itthirupa' and also when the suffixes 'ka', *ta' etc. follow." 
When the bahubbihisamasa is formed in masculine, the shortening of the final vowel of uttarapada is applicable. Dighajarigho puriso, similarly, pahutajivho bhagava means Lord having long tongue. Mahapafino means one having great wisdom. The 'maha'-substitute is applied by the rule 
'mahataih maha tulyadhikarane pade' (330-325). 

Why 'itthiyam' ? For, we have : - khamadhano. Why 'bhasitapuma'? 

For, we have :- saddhadhuro, saddhapakatiko; pannavisuddhiko. Herein, the suffix 'ka' is applied by the rule 'kvaci samasa-antagatanam akaranto' (337-335). Why 'tulyadhikarane only ? For, we have :- samanibhattiko, kumaribhattiko, kumaritthiko. This 'atidesa' of the state of masculine is applicable to the pubbapada only. By that, it is not applicable to the following :- bahudasiko puriso, bahudarikarh, bahukadalikam. When the operations of samasa etc. are operated after the analysis 'gandivo dhanu assa' :-

# (297-340) Dhanumha Ca.

And 'a' after 'dhanu' (is laid down). This (rule) has three pada-s : after the word 'dhanu' occuring as the final member in a compound, the suffix 'a' is sometimes added By the word *ca' also after the word 'dhamma' etc. The sound 'va' is applied by the rule 'vamodudantanam' (18-20). (jandivadhanva; similarly, paccakkhadhamma. Why 'kvaci' ? For, we have :- sahassathamadhanu, paccakkhadhammo, viditadhammo. Now, in the compound 
'nanadumapatitapupphavasitasanu' :- 'nanaduma' means various trees, 'nanadumapatitani' means fallen down fi-om various trees, 'nanadumapatitapupphani' means the flowers fallen down from the various trees, 'nanadumapatitapupphavasita means scented with the flowers fallen down from the various trees, 'nanadumapatitapupphavasitasanupabbataraja' means the king of mountains having the forest hills scented with the flowers fallen down from the various trees. However, this compound is called 
'tulyadhikaranabahubblhi' having kammadharaya and tappurisa inside. 

Similarly, 'byalambambudharo' means cloud hanging down, 'byalambambudharabinduni' means drops of hanging cloud, 'byalambambudharabinducumbito' means touched by those drops of hanging cloud, 'byalambambubinducumbitakuto' means that whose *peak* is touched by the drops of hanging cloud etc. 

Now, regarding the bahubbihi in the sense of locative :- As -

Akinnamanussa rajadhani means the capital in which people are crowded Bahutapaso assamo means hermitage in which there are many ascetics. 

Upacitamaiiisalohitam sarlram means body in which flesh and blood is accumulated. Bahussamikam nagaraiii means city in which there are many owners (masters). When, the samasa etc. are operated in the sense of 'many rivers herein' :- The word 'samasanta' and the suffix 'ka' (337-335) are to be understood :-

## (338-341) Nadimha Ca.

Also after 'nadi'. 

After the word 'nadi' occuring as the final member of a compound, the suffix 'ka' is added. By the word 'ca' also after the words ending in 'tu'. This reference (ca) is to make it nicca. Moreover, in this context, the word 'nadi' is parasamanfia for feminine words with the vowel 'i' and 'u'. After that, by the rule 'kvacadimajjhuttaranam etc.' (403-339), the shortening of the word 'nadi' is applied when the suffix 'ka' is added. Bahunadiko janapado; similarly, bahujambukarh vanarh. The word 'bahunariko' is accomplished by chatthibahubbihi. Bahukattuko deso means the region in which there are many workers; similarly, bahubhattuko. 

Bhinnadhikarana is as follows : ekarattivaso means he, who has a stay for single night Samanavaso puriso means he, whose stay is with his equals.

The 'tipada' as :- parakkamadhigatasampada mahapurisa means the mahapurisa-s whose attainment is obtained by perseverance; similarly, dhammadhigatabhoga; onitapattapani means he, by whom the hand is removed from the bowl, sihapubbaddhakayo means (the Blessed One) whose upper body is like the front of a lion, mattabahumatamgarti vanarh means the forest which has many elephants in rut etc. 

The 'na-nipatapubbapada' is as follows : asamo bhagava means the Blessed One who has no parallel. Here, 'na' has become 'a' by yogavibhaga: 'attannassa' in the rule 'attannassa tappurise' (333-329). Similarly, appatipuggalo, aputtako, ahetuko. The suffix 'ka' is applied by the rule 
'kvaci samasanta' etc. (337-335). Asarhvasa means those who have not common residence. 'Avutthiko janapado' means the region which has not rain, abhikkhuko viharo; anuttaro means he, than whom there is no better. The substitute 'ana' is applicable by the rule 'sare ana' (334-330). The word 'tappurisa' is for upalakkhana. Or 'na' has become 'an' by the rule 'tesu vuddhi etc' (440-335). Similarly, 'anantarh' means that which has no end, 'anasava' means those who have no defilements, etc. 

Now, regarding sahapubbapada in the sense of nominative as :-
sahetuko means that which exists together with cause, sahetuva; sa-substitute for the word saha is applied by the rule 'tesu vuddhi et c (440-355). By the rule 'kvaci samasanta etc' (337-335), the suffix 'ka' is also applied. 

'Sappitika' means those (dhamma-s) which exist together with piti, sakkileso, saupadano, saparivaro; samuluddhato rukkho means the tree which is pulled out together with root. On the other hand, 'upamanapubhapada' in the sense of nominative is as follows :- the word 'iva' is applicable for the accomplishment of the states of upamana and upameyya. Nigrodhaparimandalo rajakumaro is so called due to the equal measurement of roundness of body. The word 'iva' is not applicable by (paribhasa) 
'vuttatthanarii appayogo'. Sarikhapandaro means this is as white as a conch, kakasuro means this (person) is as brave as a crow, cakkhubhuto bhagava means the Blessed One who has become like an eye showing the ultimate reality. Similarly, atthabhuto, dhammabhuto, brahmabhuto; andhabhuto balo means the ignorant one who has become like a blind. Mufijapabbajabhuta kuditthi means the wrong view which has become like reed and bulrash. Tantakulakajata means that which has become like a ball of string.

Regarding the sankhyobhayapada together with *the* sense of the word 'va' as :- dvattipatta means two or three bowls. The final of the word *dvi' becomes 'a' by the rule 'dvekatthanarh akaro va' (383-253). Then shortening is applicable. Dvlhatiham means two or three days, chappaiicavaca means six or five utterances. Similarly, sattatthamasa, ekayojanadviyojanani. 

Now, regarding the 'disantarajattha' .- pubbadakkhina vidisa means the sub-direction between the East and South. In this context, the atidesa of the state of masculine is not applicable because the word tulyadhikarana does not follow. By the rule 'kvacadimajjhuttaranarti' etc. (403-339), in the sense of disantarala the shortening of pubbapada is applied. Similarly, pubbuttara, aparadakkhina, pacchimuttara. However, when the kammadharayasamasa in the sense of southern as well as eastern is formed, the atidesa of the state of masculine is applicable because the meaning of uttarapada is major. Even, the pronominal operation is always applicable. For example :- dakkhinapubbassa dakkhinapubbassam. Regarding the byatiharalakkhano as :- kesakesi means the fight with seizing hair of the opponent, dandadandi means fight having attacks by sticks. The lengthening is applicable in the middle by the rule 'kvacadimajjhuttaranaih' etc. (403-339). By the rule 'tesu vuddhi' etc. (404-335) the substitute 'i' is laid down for the final. 

(Here ends) the bahubbihi ending with nominative. 

The bahubbihi samasa is over. 

Now, the dvandvasamasa is being told. And, it is twofold according to the sense of i) itaretarayoga ii) samahara. Among them, firstly, itaretarayoga :- in the context of 'sariputta mogallana', the nominative singular case-ending 'si' is applicable in the both. The word 'ca' is also applicable for indicating the collection. When the analysis is done as :-
sariputto ca moggallano ca :-
(329-342) Namanaih samuccayo dvandvo. 

The combination of nouns is called 'dvandva'. 

in the same case, is an optional compound called 'dvandva'. Moreover, in this context, the collection is called 'samuccaya'. However, by the force of meaning, it is fourfold :- i) kevalasamuccaya, ii) anvacaya, iii) itaretarayoga and iv) samahara. Among them, in kevalasamuccaya and anvacaya, the samasa is not formed because the meaning of nouns is not mutually connected with relation to the action. For example : civaram pindapatanca paccayam sayanasanarh adasi, dananca dehi, silanca rakkhahi. 

In itaretarayoga and samahara, the samasa is applicable because the meanings of nouns are connected with each other. 'Dvandva' means pair of pada-s (dve dve) or double meaning (dvandvattha). This compound also is called 
'dvandva' by significant nomenclature of having similarity to 'dvandva'. For, in dvandva compound the meanings of ubhayapada-s are major. 

But when the meanings of ubhayapada-s are used as the major, how the state of single meaning is applicable to the dvandva compoimd? To answer this, it is told that :- When the saddappavatti (of samasa) in the meaning of 'sadisa' etc. also is possible, there is not contradiction even if both meanings are indicated simultaneously. Moreover, the indication of two meanings occurs in dvandva only. For, such as the word 'bhu' in the sense of anubhava and abhibhava etc. is found together with the upasagga-s anu, abhi etc. only; and not separately. Similarly, it should be known that in the expressions like 'gavassakarh', the indication of two meanings belonging to two padas in the samasa are found in their mutual association only; and not when they are used separately; therefore these expressions are covered by dvandva; and not everywhere. Or, as both pada-s indicate the 'samuccaya' under consideration, the single meaning is applicable also to dvandva; and therefore there is no contradiction. After that. 

samasasanfia, vibhattilopa etc. are applicable as laid down before. The meaning of 'ca' is indicated by samasa only, therefore ca is not used according to 'vuttatthanam appayogo'. In this context, in dvandva, pada having less vowels is put initially. And, the gender is like the following pada. Only plural is applicable always in itaretarayoga because, therein avayavas are major. Sariputtamoggallana, sariputtamoggallane, sariputtamoggallanehi etc. Samanabrahmana means samana and brahmin; similarly, brahmanagahapatika, khattiyabrahmana, devamanussa, candimasuriya; matapitaro means mother and father. By the rule 'tesu vuddhi' etc. (404-355) in dvandva compound, the sound *u' of pubbapada-s like 
'matu' etc. becomes 'a'. Similarly, pitaputta. In the context of 'jayapati' meaning wife and husband The word 'kvaci' is understood :-

## (339-343) Jayaya Tudaihjani Patimhi.

The word 'jaya' followed by 'pati' is changed into 'tudarfi' and 'jani'. When the word 'pati' follows, sometimes, the word 'jaya' is changed into 'tudam' and 'jani'. Tudampati, janipati; jayampatika :- In this context, niggahita is augmented And the shortening is applied by the rule 'kvacadi' etc. (403-339). Sometimes, the pada having less vowels is used as first member. For example :- candasuriya means moon and sun; surasuragarulamanujabhujagagandhabba means gods, demons, garudas, human beings, serpents and heavenly musicians. The 'i' vanna and 'u' vanna are sometimes, used as first members. For example :- aggidhuma means fire and smoke; similarly, gatibuddhibhujapathaharakarasaya; dhatulirigani means roots and genders. Sometimes, the padas beginning with a vowel and ending in 'a', are put as first members. For example :- atthadhamma means the attha and the dhamina; similarly, atthasadda or saddattha. However, in the samahara :- in the sense of 'eye and ear' when the dvandvasamasa is formed by the rule 'namanarh samuccayo dvandvo' (329-342), the vibhattilopa etc. are done :- The words 'napumsakalingam' and 'ekattam' are imderstood :-

## (322-344) Tatha Dvandve Pani-Turiya-Yogga-Senahga Khuddajantuka-Vividhaviruddha-Visabh^Attha-Adinaih Ca.

Even so in the dvandva compound of pani, turiya, yogga, senanga, khuddajantuka, vividhaviruddha, visabhagattha etc. (the singularity and neuter gender are laid down). 

Even so in the samaharadvandvasamasa in the sense of factors of army such as pani, turiya, yogga and in the sense of khuddajantuka, vividha, viruddha and visabhaga etc. the singularity and neuter gender are applicable as in 'digusamasa'. 

'Panituriyayoggasenangani' means the factors of pani, turiya, yogga, and sena. As the word anga occurs after the dvandva it is applicable to each member. Khuddhajantuka means little creatures; vividhaviruddha means objects which indicate various degrees of difference, always opposite. Sabhaga means that which has the same division. Sa-substitute of die word samana is applied by the rule 'tesu vuddhi' etc. (404-355). Visabhaga means the objects which are various by lakkhana and different by action. 

'Pani-turiya-yogga-senanga-khuddajantuka-vividhaviruddha-visabhaga-' is a dvandva - compound made of 'pani; turiya, yogga, senanga, khuddajantuka, vividhaviruddha and visabhaga'. In this compound there is not fixed rule for pubbanipata, because the members are many in number. 'Having those meanings' - means 'pani-turiya-yogga-senanga-ichuddajantuicavividhaviruddha-visabhagattha'. Beginning with those meanings means 
'tadadayo'. 

By the force of 'adi', to the words in the sense of saiikhya, parimana, pacana, candala and disa etc. which have a specific gender, the singularity and neuter gender are applicable in dvandva samasa. In the sense of limbs of a living being, when singularity and neuter gender are applied to the words cakkhu and sota, the term nama is applied due to samasa and then the suffixes si etc. are applied as well as amadesa etc. are operated :- Cakkhusotam, he cakkhusota, cakkhusotam, cakkhusotena, similarly, only the singular is applicable everywhere.
