"YO NIRUmM NA SIKKHEYYA SIKKHANTO PITAKATTAYAM 
FADE FADE VIKANKHEYYA VANE ANDHAGAJO YATHA." 
"One who would not study Grammar (Nirutti) while studying the 'Tipitaka', would obtain uncertainty in every step like a blind elephant (roaming about) in a jungle." 
The present thesis deals with the study of *'RupasiddhP* a Pali grammatical woric. It is divided into four parts i. e. Text, Translation, Notes and Bibliography. I have attempted to presoit the text in Devanagari script along with an English translation and notes. It is expected that this modest attempt would lead to the production of complete edition of *'Rupasiddhi"* in future. 

I wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to my guide **Dr. J. R. Joshi,** Reader in Pali, Department of Sanskrit and Prakrit Languages, University of Pune, without whose sincere guidance and co-operation the work would not have been accomplished. 

I express my deepest gratitude to PHRARAJMEDHI (VARAVIJJA 
GANGAPANNO) Wat Mahadhatu Bangkok, the Ecclesiastical Regional Governor (Culasanghamandalapamokkha), my preceptor who has contributed in developing my scholastic interests and abilities. 

I expressly record my gratefulness to PHRAGRU 
UDOMDHAMMARAK (YOD YASAJATO). the vice - Rrrlpsiasriral Provincial Governor (Nagarasarighanupamokkha) of Mukdahan Province, my 
(First) ordination-teacher who encouraged me to study. 

I also take this opportunity to express my thanks to Mrs. 

FETCHARA PINTONG, the President of R. Thai Bronze Makers Co. 

Ltd. for granting me financial support for five years, from the time of studying for M. A. (Pali & Sanskrit) till the present time. If she would not have granted me scholarship for the whole tenure of five years, it would not have been possible to pursue my studies at all. I, therefore, express my utmost gratitude to her. 

No words are enough to express my heartiest gratitude towards my beloved parents, who have constantly inspired, provided valuable opportunities and affection to me in building up my career in educational field-
I must thank Phramaha Thiab Malai with whom I discussed the subject-matter and also all of those friends of mine who have helped me in needful hours. 

Last but not the least, 1 am thankful to **Prof. Dr. Saroja Bhate,** 
the Head of the Department of Sanskrit and Prakrit Languages, University of Pune, for providing all facilities to undertake the present study.
