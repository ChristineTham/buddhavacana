# Explanatory Notes

## Namakanda

The 'Namakanda' is introduced in the *Rupasiddhi* by the words 'Atha namikavibhatyavataro vuccate' (Now, the topic about the nominal case-ending is being told). 'Nama' means the designation of matter (Dabbabhidhanam). And the meaning of the word 'Nama' is divided into two as follows :-
1] It tends towards the meaning (attharii namatiti namam). 2] It brings the meaning in itself (attani nametiti namam). 

The 'Nama' is twofold as :-
1. Anvatthanama (noun according to the sense) (PDT p. 24. 

'Attharii gatarii anvattharii'). For example :- Puriso (man). 

2. Rulihinama [noun grown by convention or the noun which is grown not according to sense but according to desire]. (PDT p. 24. 'atthanirapekkharii namam yadicchanamarii'.) For example 'tisso, sirivaddho' etc. 

The 'Nama' is threefold as :- 1] PuUiriga (masculine) i. e. Rukkho 
(tree). 2] Itthilinga (feminine) i. e. mala (garland). 3] Napurfisakalinga (Neuter) i. e. dhanarii (wealth). 

It is fourfold as :-
1. Samaniianama [the noun based on the state of generality]. 

(PDF. p. 98 'samananarii bhavo samafinarii, samannehi pavattarii namarfi samannanamarii'.) For example :- rukkho 2. Gunanama [The noun which describes the specification of matter]. (PDF. p. 98 'attano dabbam guneti pakaseti guno, gunehi pavattaih nama gunanamam'.) For example :- nilo (dark blue). 

3. Kiriyanama [The noun which is based on an action] (PDF. 

p, 98 'kaianam kiriya, kiriyaya pavattam namaiii kiriyanamam'.) 
4. Yadicchanama [The noun which is based on desiring]. (FDF. 

p. 98 'ya ya iccha yadiccha, yadicchaya pavattam namam yadicchanamam.') For example :- sirivaddho, tisso etc. 

It is eightfold as :- 1 & 2. Avannapakatinama [The noun aiding in 'a' or 'a'] like purisa, sa etc. (PDT p. 25). 3 & 4. Ivannapakatinama [The noun ending in 'i' or 'i'] like aggi, dandi etc. (PDT p. 25). 5 & 6. Uvannapakatinama [The noun ending in 'u' or 'u') like bhikkhu, abhibhu etc. (PDT p. 25). 7. Okarantapakatinama (The noun ending in 'o') like go, sutano etc. (PDT p. 25). 8. Niggahitantapakatinama (The noun ending in niggahita) like kiiii, idaih etc. (PDT p. 25). 

'Nama' is oftai mentioned first as in the following verse from PDT.- "padarii catubbidhaih vuttaiii namakhyatopasaggaiica nipataiicati viiiiiuhi, asso khalu abhidhavati." - Rule 60 :- The nile 'Jinavacanayuttam hi' is 'adhikarasutta'. 

The meaning of 'adhikara' is 'governing'. PDT has given explanation that 
'adhikara' is so called because it governs (adhikiriyati). The meaning is rules. The adhikara is divided into three as :-
1. Sihagatika-adhikara means it is governing as lion looks forward and backward; f. e. the rule 'Jinavacana-yuttaiii hi.' 
2. Man4ukagatika-adhikaTa means it is governing as frog jumps forward and not backward; f. e. the rule 'Ghapato smiih yam va' (180). (Rup T. p. 65 f. e. 'ghapato smirfi yarn va ito mandukagatiya vati.') 
3 Yathanupubbika-adhikara means it is governing by sequence, according to the rule or it is governing like stream of a river. [PDP. p. 43. 'nadisotagatikadhikara.']. 

- Rule 61 :- The word 'patipadika' which occurs in this rule 
(61) is a synonymous for flie word 'Lingarii'. About 'Lingarii patipadikam' PDT reanaiks that it is the expression of noun only. (PDT p. 26 'namassa eva pariyayo'.) So, this rule is 'paribhasasutta'. And the words *linga, nama and patipadika become synonyms. (PDP. p. 103 'Lingarh namaiii patipadikasadisaiiL) 
- Rule 62 :- This rule is the 'vibhattividhisutta'. The word 'ca' which occurs in the mle implys that even after the suffixes 'tave, tuna' etc., the case-aiding is to be applied (such as katave, katuna, katva, katvana etc.) The case-ending is elided by the rule 'sabbasam avuso' etc. [Rup T. p. 361 'tavetunamantato sabbasamavusoti-adinarh vibhattilopo.'] 
- Rule 63 :- 1. Saiinasutta : 'Sesa byanjana* (8) etc. 2. 

Paribhasasutta : 'Parasamaiina Payoge' (11), 'Lingaiica nipaccate' (61) etc. 

In *Kaccayanasuttattha* we have sixfold division as :- 1. sannasutta 2. paribhasasutta 3. vidhisutta 4. niyamasutta 5. atidesasutta 6. adhikarasutta (KS p. 15 "sanna ca paribhasa ca vidhipi niyamo pi ca addesadhikaroti chabbidham suttalakkhanaih") 
The present is vidhisutta. 

- Rule 68 :- The word 'ekasesa' which occurs in this rule has twofold implication : 1) sarupdcasesa :- it is the case when a single form out of the similar ones rranains as a final one, for example, 'Puriso ca purisa ca purisa*. 2) virupekasesa :- it is the case when one form out of differait forms ranains, f e. 'mata ca pita ca pitaro'. (PDP p. 114). PDT has given more explanation as 'samanam rupam yesanti sarupa. eko ca so seso cati'. (PDT p. 29). Among them, the sarupekasesa is divided into three as :-
1. saddasarupekasesa : the words are similar but meaning is differait : *maso ca maso ca masa (month and bean) 
2. atthasarupekasesa : the meaning is similar but words are differrait 'vaiyco ca kutilo ca kutila' (crooked). 

3. saddatthasarupdcasesa : both meaning and word are the same 
'puriso ca puriso ca purisa'. As it is told : 
"sarupasseva saddattha saddatthanam sabhavato tibbidhattarh yatha masa kutila purisati ca". 

(PDP. p. 114) 
The virupekasesa is divided into two as :-
preceding word is elided as :- 'mata ca pita ca pitaro'. 

2. paiavirupekasesa : When the forms are different, the following word is elided as 'sariputto ca moggallano ca sariputta'. 

The words belonging to the 'virupekasesa' must be related in meaning; like matu pitu, ayyaka ayyika etc. 

According to Rup T. «& S. tatheva = tatha + eva. B. reads : tattheva= 
tatdia + eva. B. seems to be better because translation would be 'in that (pullinga) only instead of just 'then' or 'moreover'. 

- Rule 69 :- The word *va' is understood :-
1. Niccavidhi : In masculine the case-ending 'yo' is changed into a-e always. For example :- purisa purise. 

2. Aniccavidhi : In neuter the case-ending *yo' is not always changed into a-e. For example :- rupa / rupani. 

3. Asantavidhi : When preceded by 'i' (technically called 'jha'.) 
The case-ending 'yo' is not changed into a-e. For example:- aggayo, munayo. 

- Rule 83 :- The words "avitthena purisena so puiinam karoti" occur under this rule. The meaning is "The non-human spirit (amanussa) 
makes merit for the man in whom it is living (i. e. in his body)". For this, the PDT gives the example as follows :- "so amanusso abhivadanadini karonto pufiiiam karoti vibodhanakale dussimaro viya." (PDT p. 30). 

- Rule 95 :- The word 'manoppabhutigano' occurs under the rule 95. B. & S. read :- 'manopabhuti' (as in PTS Diet). T. reads 
'manoppabhuti'. pabhuti (short) seems to be more correct But in Rup T. 

everywhere, it is long only. For example :- 'bhikkhuppabhutito' (155). (Rup T. p. 67.), 'mahamandhatupabhutayo' (167) (Rup T. p. 71.). 

- Rule 96 :- After this nile Rup T. & S. read : 'vati vattate'. 

B. reads 'manoganadito vati ca vattate'. B. seems to be correct because both words are to be followed in the next rule (97), The word 'va' is also vavatthitavibhasa in three ways as : 1. Niccavidhi : manasikarh cetasikam 
('sa' is always augmented). *\\.* Aniccavidhi : manasa manena, manaso manassa (sometimes 'sa' is not augmented), ill. Asantavidhi : mano mana manaih mane PDP. p. 127. [no augmentation of 'sa'] 
- Rule 97 :- Rup T. & S. read : 'savibhattissa ntussanto, sabbasseva ntussati ca'. B. reads : 'savibhattissa ntussati ca'. Sub-comm«itary has given explanation as : 'The word 'savibhattissa' is taken fix)m the rule 
'amhassa mamarii savibhattissa se' [120-243] and the word 'ntussa' from the rule 'ntussa-nto' [99]. For the words 'sabbasseva ntussa' which are repeated in Rup T. & S. seem to be redundant Thus, the rule should be read as in B. 

- Rule 101 :- Rup T. & S. read : 'am a a adesa honti'. B. 

reads: 'aiiiavanna iccete adesa honti'. The meaning of both the readings is the same because 'a a = avanna But in this way, Rup T. & S. want to express the meaning of avanna clearly. So, it has become 'a a adesa'. 

- Rule 112 :- By the word 'ca' which occured under this rule, even the word 'santa' can change into 'sa' though the nimitta is other than the second 'bha'. But that word must be compound only, as 'santapuriso' becomes 'sappuriso'. The word 'santa' is originated from the root sama + ta suffix. *(PUT. p.* 137). The final sound 'ma' is changed into 'na'. 

- Rule 120 :- In Rup T. The words 'smavacanassa nabyapadeso' occur under the rule 120. B. reads : 'smavacanassa nabhavatideso'. S. reads : 'smavacanassa nabyapadesatideso'. The mining does not differ. But B. *seems* better than other readings as the sub-commentary paraphrases : 'smavacanassa narupassa atideso'. 

The word 'atidesa' also occurs under this rule. The meaning is 'the expression' *(PUT* p. 34. 'atidisatiti atideso'). It is sixfold as follows :-
1. Byapadesatidesasutta : the expression of nomenclature like 
'Taddhitasamasakitaka namarii va tavetunadisu ca' [334]. 

2. Nimittatidesasutta : the expression of nimitta like 'Sara sare loparii' [13] and 'Tatha kattari ca' [511]. 

3. Taihrupatidesasutta : the expression of the particular forms. 

Reference may be made to 'amhatumhantu. sma nava' 
[120]. Brahma + sma = brahmuna. The case-ending 'sma' is changed into 'na' by this rule. 

4. Tarhsabhavatidesasutta : the expression of general nature 
[sabhava] of forms. Reference may be made to 'itthiyam bhasitapumitdii pumava ce' [338]. It is indicated that the 5. Suttatidesasutta : The expression of the rule [which is not mentioned] like 'anupaditthanam vuttayogato' [59]. 

6. Kariyatidesasutta The expression of the way of grammatical action like 'sesesu ntuva' [108], 'yam ntussa kariyam vihitam, tameva ntasaddassati atidisati' (PDT. p. 33) 
- Rule 149 :- Rup T. & S. read : 'jhalato sassa no vati sassa no 'jhala' iccetehi paiassa'. B. reads : 'jhalato sassa no vati no'. Genitive suffix is changed into 'no' by the rule 'jhalato va' [124]. For example: 
aggino. 

- Rule 164 :- For this rule, Rup T. & S. read : 'satthun-attaih ca'. B. reads : 'sutthunattaiica'. The meaning is : 'The [final] of satthu also becomes 'a'. Thus, satthanam : satthu + nam. U becomes 'a'. The state of 'a' for the final of the word satthu etc. is indicated 
- Rule 167 :- In this rule, the word 'sakamandhat-adinaiica' occurs, instead of the word 'sakamandhatu', the sub-commentaiy gives the form : 'sakkamandhata' [sakko ca mandhata ca] (PDT. p. 39). 

- Rule 168 :- The expression 'bhavaniddesena' is based on the rule 'einnesu arattam' [159]. Rupasiddhi wants to indicate the optional forms for the substitute 'ara' in the case of the word 'pitu'. Thus, pitubhi pituhi etc. 

Rup T. & S. read : itthilingani. B. reads : itthilingani. This word occurs in the tide of the topic about feminine gender. Rup T. & S. lengthen 
'i' ('itthr) when joined with 'linga'. According to B. the word 'itthilingani* is a compound [Tappurisa]. So the word Mtthi' is shortened. For example :- 'itthiya ruparh = itthirupaih'. Bhikkhuninam saiigho = bhikkhunisangho. 'Itthi' is the feminine word ending in 'i'. Everywhere, in the compound, Rup T. & S. make it lengthened For example :- itthipaccaya [176], itthilingo etc. 

- **Rule 189** :- Mahavutti or Mahasutta is fourfold :-
"Mahasutta tesu vuddhi kvaci dhatu ca paccaya -danittha yadanupadi cattaripi nipatana". 

1. Tesu vuddhilopagamavikaraviparitadesa ca [355]. 2. Kvaci dhatuvibhattipaccayanarh dighaviparitadesalopagama ca [472]. 3. paccayadanittha nipatana sijjhanti [608]. 4. Yadanuppanna nipatana sijjhanti [407]. 

'gosaddato nadadito va iti ipaccayo, mahavuttina va'. This means : 
after the word 'go' the suffix 'i' is either applied by the rule 'nadadito va V [187] or by the mahasutta [tesu vuddhi etc], go + i = gavi. 

- Rule **191** :- Rup T. & S. read = 'gomati'. But B reads: 
'gottamati'. 

- **Rule 194** :- In B. due to full stop after ini, two sentences are formed. It is better than single sentence in which 'ca' is required [in Rup T. & S. : 'Tatheva raja-saddato ini 'saralopapakatibhava']. 

Raja + ini = Rajini. The vowel 'a' of the word 'raja' is elided. 

Sometimes, 'pakatibhava' is applicable. For example :- 'bhikkhu + ini = 
bhikkhuni. The vowel 'u' has pakatibhava The word 'paracittaviduni' cx:curs in the Rupasiddhi twice. First expression is to indicate an example for the suffix 'ini' which is applied after the word vidu, yakkha etc. Second one is for the explanation of 'paralopa - rassattani'. Paracittavidu + in! = paracittaviduni. '0 ' of vidu is shortened. And 'i' of 'ini' is elided 
- Rule 226 :- In the first line of vutti under this rule [226], 
Rup T. reads = 'paccayato'. B. & S. read 'vappaccayato'. The meaning is : when the suffix 'va' follows, the word 'kim' is changed into 'ka'. 

Kim + va = kva. Even before a suffix other than 'va' ('tha, ha' etc.) the word 'kiih' becomes 'ka'. Katharh = kiiii + tha. Kahaih = kirii + ha. 

- Rule 241 :- Under this rule, the words 'tava mama va diyate' occur as example in Rup T. And it is not available in B. & S. But in B. & S. it finds a place under the rule no 242. 

- Rule 244 :- The meaning of this rule is : 'After the words 
'tumha and amha', the case-ending 'nam' is changed into 'akarh' [or am]. In the vutti, Rup T. reads :- 'attanca'. B. & S. read 'am ca'. The meaning becomes clear as follows :- *tumhaifi =* tumha + nam. Nam becomes 'am', tumhakaih = tumha + narh. Nam becomes 'akarh'. 

And according to the rule 'tesu vuddhi' etc. [404-455], the word 
'amha' is sometimes changed into 'asma'. For example :- amha + nam= 
asmakaiii, asmakam dhammata. 

- Rule 250 :- "Tatha paficadinamatthadasantanam katisaddassa valingatta tiliiigepi samanam rupam". These words occur under this rule. 

For the word which is underlined, the reading in Rup T. & B. is 'calingatta'. And S. reads 'vaccalingatta'. According to Rup T. the translation of the word 'va' is 'or'. For the word 'ca' the translation would be 'and'. But for S. it is difficult to translate. The meaning is : "Moreover, the words fixMn 'paiica' to 'atthadasa' or [and] the word 'Kati' being without specific gender, have the same form in aU genders." 'Vaccalingatta' may mean : 'the gender being dependent on the use / user.' 
- Rule 251 :- For the word 'atthadasa', B. & S. read :-
'attharasa'. In Rup T., the form atthadasa is available elsewhere under the rules 250, 251, 252 and 253. 

- Rule 256 :- Of the word 'Catu', tu is elided, and 'ca' is changed into 'cu' or 'co'. Cuddasa = catu + dasa. Coddasa = catu + dasa. 

- Rule 270 :- The words 'hadathamadi' and 'avapaccayepi' should better be joined as 'kiih' is substituted by 'ka' *even* when the suffixes other than 'va', such as tha, ha etc. follow. Thus, Kirn + tharh = Katharfi. Kiih + ham = Kaharh. 

## Samasakanda

The 'Samasakanda' is introduced in Rupasiddhi by the words 'atha namanaih eva' etc. That means the grammarian is expressing the samasa 
[compound] following the rule [which occurs in Kaccayana] : 'namanaih samaso yuttattho' *(PUT* p. 97) The samasa is based on nouns and itself has the characteristic of a noun. When two or more words raiter into combination with one another and form a grammatical unit, that imit is called a compound [samasa, lit, thrown together = Vasa with sam]. 

The samasa is made of nouns related to each other as 'raiino puriso' 
[PDT p. 97) etc. Moreover, the word samasa has five meanings as 'samo', 
sankhepo, sarfiharo samaso sangaho" (AP. p. 32, 116). And through the point of view of nomenclature (sanna), it is sixfold : 1) Abya>abhava :- Adverbial. 2) Kammadharaya : Appoisitional, 3) Digu : Numerical, 4) Tappurisa : Determinative, 5) Bahubbihi : Relative, and 6) Dvanvda : 
Copulative. The samasa is also divided into two ; [1. Niccasamasa and 2. Aniccasamasa] by its fomiation [sabhavato] (Sadd p. 745 'sabhavato niccasamaso aniccasamasoti duvidho'). 1. *Niccasamasa* means the samasa which is not explained by the analysis (viggaha) because it is easy to understand [like the word 'kantho' SSMT p. 82 kaih ettha thatiti kantho]. 2. Aniccasamasa means the samasa which is explained by the dissolution [like 'naiQ>palam' : nilanca tarn iqjpalam cati nilv5)palam]. (SSMT p. 83). 

- Rule 315 :- The words 'atthapubbakehi upasagganipatehi' occur under this rule. For the word 'attha', [Rup T. & S.]. B. reads : 
'atthapubbakehi'. In the case of Rup T. & S. the translation would be 
"The meaning of upasagga and nipata having preceded". For B. the translation would be : "The upasagga and nipata themselves being preceded". 

Bodi are helpftil to indicate die meaning of 'abyayibhavasamasa : the compound having iqKisagga or nipata as first member. For example :- yavajivarh [as long as life lasts], anujetthaiii [according to seniority] etc. 

- Rule 316 :- The following gatha occures under this rule :-
The grammarian wants to explain the difference between 'samasa' 

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

and 'taddhita'. PDT. has given more explanation that "The combination of padas [two or more] into single one is called 'Samasa'. (PDT. p. 98. 

"padanarii sankhepo ekapadattarh samaso" For example :- mahanto puriso mahapiiriso [the great man], samano ca brahmano ca samanabrahmano 
[samana and brahmin] etc. The addition of suffix into a pada is called 'taddhita'. (PDT. p. 98. "padapaccayanarh saiihitam taddhitanti"). For example, 'gamanaih samuho gamata'. (IP. p. 168). The Taddhita suffix 'ta' is added to pada in the sense of 'a collection of'. 

And also the words 'luttasamasa' and 'aluttasamasa' occur under this rule. (Sadd p. 745. 'so ca samaso luttasamaso aluttasamasoti duvidho.') 
1) *Luttasamasa* means the compound in which the case-ending is elided That is, only the final part has case-ending, not the preceding part For example :- rajaputto khattiyakaiina etc. 

2) *Aluttasamasa* means the compound in which the case-ending is not elided That is the preceding part has case-ending like the following one. For example :- urasilomo [brahmano], durenidanarh etc. 

- Rule 318 :- The word 'atidesa' occurs under this rule to indicate that the 'nimittatidesasutta' is to be used in the sense of vibhattinimitta [vibhattinimitto hutva]. (PDT. p. 100). Further the words 
'sakatthavirahenidha samasassa ca lingabhavabhava' occur under the rule. For the word 'lingabhavabhava' [Rup T. & B.] S. reads :- liiigasabhavabhava.' Sub-commentary has given explanation for this word as : 'lirigasaiinaya asambhavato'. (PDT. p. 100) 
- Rule 319 :— The expression 'namamvatavetunadisu' occurs in this rule. Rup T. splits the word as 'namarh va tavetunacUsu'. B. & S. have joined as : 'namaiiivatavetunadisu'. For the reading in Rup T. is not clear. According to B. & S., the spliting will be 'namam + iva + atavetunadisu'. The word 'a' means, 'vajjetva' according to the vutti. 

- Rule 321 :- Under this rule, Rup T. & S. read : *a kumarehi yaso akumaraih yaso kaccayanassa'. B. reads 'a kumarehi yaso kaccayanassa akumaram.' Rupasiddhi has given this example to explain the meaning of a-upasagga in the senses of mariyada and abhividhi. Both the examples are not differoit in meaning. But B. seons to be more correct 
- Rule 323 :- The words 'tircrfaiddaiii' and 'nagarato' occur under this rule. For the word 'tirokudda' (Rup T. &. S.) B, reads *tirdaitta'. 

According to FED (p. 219), the meaning of kutta or kudda is 'daub wall'. For 'nagarato', [Rup T. & S.] B. reads 'nagarassa' which seems better. 

- Rule 326 :- The words 'punno mantaniputto, citto gahapati', 
and 'sakko devaraja' occur under this rule. The grammarian has given explanation that these words are not samasa-s on the strength of vibhasa 
[option]. (PDT. p. 104). 

- Rule 329 :- This rule explains the nature of 
'nanipatapubbapada'. Entire *na' becomes 'a' or 'ana'. And the completed form of this compound is adjective as 'amanusso' = na manusso [This person] is not man, 'anuttaro' = na uttaro etc. Rup. divides the meaning of 'na' into two as : [1] pariyudasapatisedha means warding off a thing in the specific part as : abrahmano and [2] pasajjappatisedha means warding off all parts as : abrahmanamanavo etc. For the word 'abrahmanamanavo' which occurs under this rule [Rup T. & S.], B. reads 'abrahmanamanussa'. 

- Rule 335 :- The words 'rajadigahanassedam gahanarh' occur under this rule [Rup T. & S.) But B. reads : 'etarh' at the final of the first word. The meaning is the same. According to Rup T. & S. the form is 'idarii' that is neuter [ima]. And B. reads the form 'etarh' 
[from eta] in neuter. It is the adjective of 'gahanarh'. 

The word 'attam' occurs under this rule [Rup T. & B.]. S. reads 
'attho'. The meaning of 'attam' is the "state of 'a'." It seems to be more correct than 'attho'. Because the grammarian emphasises the vowel 'a' in the final of the words 'raja' etc. 

- Rule 336 :- The word 'anabhidhanato' occurs under this rule. Rup T. reads as above. B. & S. read 'anabhidhanato'. 

- Rule 337 :- The words 'anfinesam samapathama-dutiyadivibhatyantanarh' occur under this rule. The reading of Rup. T. & S. is the same. But B. reads :- 'annesarh pathamadutiyadivibhatyantanam'. Here, Rup T. & S. have given better reading than B. Because it will be better to spilt as 'samapathamanarh and dutiyadivibhatyantanam'. The meaning is: 
'The nouns having proper meaning are optionally combined in the senses other than their own, ending with accusative case etc. [and] always in nominative case.' For example :- agatasamano = agata samana yarn so agatasamano [sangharamo]. (Rup T. same rule p. 187). And the words underlined indicate 'aiinapada' as 'yo-yarh-yena-yassa-yasma-yassa-yasminti pathamadivibhatyantanam attha aiinapadattha'. *(PUT.* p. 114) Therefore, the word 'sama' Is significant 
- Rule 338 :- This rule ^(plains bahubbihisamasa. When we see the analysis of samasa, the preceding and following components of bahubbihi have the same case. H^ie combined meaning follows the subject Because bahubbihisamasa is used as an adjective. Therefore, the anraqpada' is the subject The samasapada qualifying die masculine subject must be masculine even if die cranpcment is fcaninine as 'Kalyana bhariya yassa so kalyanabhariyo [puriso]' (SSMT. p. 182), or *<Ugha jangha ^'»«"- <"> cfighajangho tpuriso].' (SSNfT. p. 182) 
- Rule 341 :- The word 'attain' occur under this rule. Rup T. 

A S. read 'attam'. B. reads 'attain'. Both readings are corrected But the btter is better than the formCT. Because die latter retains 'a', \^ich is diown in the vutti. 

- Rule 342 :- Rup T. & S. have 'dvandva'. B. has 'dvanda', 
which is followed in DPL (p. 130). 

The word 'kvacitappassaram' occurs under this rule. B. & S. read 
•accitataram'. Rup T. reads as above. It is better to read as B. & S. because tfie meaning is more clear therein. The anphasised word should be put mitially as 'samano ca brahmano ca = samanabrahmana', 'devo ca manusso ca devamanussa' etc. 

- Rule 343 :- And sometimes, in dvandvasamasa the pada having less vowels is put initially. For example :- 'cando ca suriyo ca candasuriya'. The word 'canda' has less vowels than 'suriya'. Similarly, in 'nigama ca janapada ca nigamajanapada'. 

- Rule 345 :- B. & S. read 'accitappasaraih', as it occurs under the rule numbers 342 (B. & S. 'idha dvande accitataraihO. and 343 (B. & S. 'kvaci appasaram pubbain pubbaih nipatati'). Rup T. reads : 
'kvacitappasararii'; the meaning of which is not clear. Thus B. & S. give better reading. 

## Akhyatakanda

The 'akhyatakanda' is introduced in Rupsiddhi by the words 'atha akhyatavibhattiyo' etc. to indicate verbal terminations. Also in Sanskrit, it is called 'akhyata'. The word 'akhyata' is frcon 'a' [upasagga] + ^khya + the suffix 'ta'. The meaning is 'the pada indicating action' ['kiriyam acikkhadti akhyatam' or 'kiriyam akkhayatiti akhyatam']. (Sadd T. vol. II p. 323). 'Akhyata' is a part of speech [vacivibhaga] and indicates main verb of a sentence (KCM. p. 36). It is comprised of vibhatti (case-termination), kala [time], pada, vacana, purisa, paccaya and vacaka. 

But the significant division is threefold as :- dhatu, paccaya and vibhatti (KCM. p. 36). The 'dham' is the veibal root 'Paccaya' is the sign to indicate 'vacaka'. And 'vibhatti' is the sign to express kala, pada, vacana and purisa. The vibhatti of akhyata is eightfold : vattamana, pancami, sattami, *parckkha.,* hiyyattani, ajjattani, bhavissanti and kalatipatti. 'Kala' is threefold as : paccuppannakala [present], atitakala [past] and anagatakala [future]. It has two padas as : parassapada and attanopada. It has two vacanas as : dcavacana [singular] and bahuvacana [plural]. It has three purisas as: pathamapurisa, majjhimapurisa and uttamapurisa. 'Dhatu' is divided into eight groups as : bhu, rudha, diva, su, ki, gaha, tana and cura. And it has three karakas as kattukaraka, kammakaraka and bhavakaraka. Further it is told in Rupasiddhi that the word which has three kala-s, three purisa-s, indicating action, having three karakas and no gender [and] having two vacana-s is called 'akhyata'. (see Text p. 87). 

- Rule 408 :- The word 'bhuvadayo' occurs in diis rule. The Tflca has given explanation as : *bhu ca va ca bhuva va'ti gati-bandhanesu imassa gahanarii. *(PUT.* p. 134) 
- Rule 412 :- The word 'tassaddhananiyam^ia' occurs under this rule. B. & S. have 'tassa thananiyame' which is better because the meaning becomes clear as : 'there is not a rule indicating the place of suffix'. 

- Rule 416 :- The word 'sadhakavacake' occurs under this rule. 

Rup T. & S. read as above, B. reads kaiakavacake. The meaning of 'sadhaka' is 'accomplishing' or 'effecting'. (PED. p. 210) The word 'karaka' means 'the doer' (PED. p. 703) or 'subject'. The grammarian implys that 'when noun indicating karaka [subject) having the same-case relation is used or not'. It is undestood as : 'bhikkhu gamaih pindaya pavisati; paccagantva attano vihare tarn bhunjati'. (KS. p. 108). First sentence hasi the subject 
(bhikkhu), but second has not The verbs 'pavisati' and 'bhunjati' have the same person [purisa] and number [vacana]. Thus, according to PDT, B. has better reading than Rup T. & S. ['tumhamhavajjite karake abhidheyyeti attho']. (PDT. p. 135). 

- Rule 425 :- The words 'gamu sappagatimhi' occur under this rule. Rup T. reads as above. B. & S. read 'gamasappa gatimhi'. The roots *gama' and 'sappa' are in the sense of going. [PDT :- 'gamusappaiccete gatiiiihi gamane vattante.]. *(PUT.* p. 137). 

- Rule 430 :- The word 'sampattrbhavanam' occurs under this rule. Rup T. & S. read as above. B. reads *'sampatibhavanam'.* The word 
'sampati' [sarii + pati; = Sanskrit samprati] means 'now' (PED. p.670). The word 'sampatti' [sam + patti] means success, attainment, happiness (PED. p. 670) etc. So, B. is better reading than Rup. T. & S. 

- Rule 440 :- The word 'hiyyopabhuti' occur in tiiis rule. Rup T. reads as above. B. & S. read 'hiyyoppabhuti'. [u of pabhuti beoMnes 
'u'] According to PDT., it is shortened : 'pabhutisaddo adiattho'. (PDT. 

p. 139). B. & S. are supported by PED. : 'pabhuti [adi] begirming, since etc'. (PED. p. 415.) 
- Rule 443 :- The word 'taddhipakatta' occurs under this rule. 

B. & S. read 'taddipakatta*. The meaning is 'Due to indicating that' [Tam + dipakatta]. Similar expression occurs under many rules i. e. 452. 

[tarhdipakatta], 456 [bhavissantikala-dipakatta], and 458 [tad<Upakatta]. PDT., 
p. 141 : 'taihkaladipakattati adi vuttam'. 

- Rule 447 :- The words 'tassa bhussa' occur under this rule. 

B. & S. read : 'vassa bhussa'. The grammarian wants to give explanation of the vowel preceding the reduplicated syllable. When the suffix kha, cha and sa follow, the vowels a, a, u Jire [optionally] changed into i. i. For example :- Jigucchati = *'^gupa* + cha + ti. 'Gu' is reduplicated = 
gugupachati. 'Ga' is changed into 'ja' = jugupachati. The vowel 'u' of 
'ju' becomes 'i' = jigucchati. (KCM. p. 137). Pivasati = VpF + sa + 
ti. Pa is reduplicated : papa. The letter 'pa' is changed into 'va' = pavasati. 

The vowel 'a' of abbhasa is changed into 'i' = pivasati. (KCM. p. 142). 

- Rule 450 :- The words 'asabbadhatuke byanjanadimhe vayamagamo' occur under this rule. For the words 'nadimhe vayagamo' 
[Rup T. & B.], S. reads '-nadimhevayamagamo'. It can be spilt as : '-nadimhi + eva + ayam + agamo*. As in Rup T. & B. the meaning of 'va' is 'optional'. In the context of S. : 'eva = only', which is supported by PDT. 'byanjanadimhevati ttha-mha-ssati-ssati-evam-adike byanjanapubbake eva' (p. 140). 

- Rule 457 :- The words 'anekajatisariisaraih sandhavissam' occur under this rule. The grammarian has given explanation that evai in the sraise of past, the 'bhavissanti' is used and in that context this example is given. *Saddaniti* does not agree with Rupasiddhi Because the word 'sandhavissam' is not bhavissanti but it is ajjattanivibhatti. And 'im' is changed into 'issam'. This vidhi occurs in *Saddaniti* under the rule 1103. 

[Sadd T. vol. II p. 371] 'atikkante atthe vattabbe 'im-vibhattiya issariiadeso hoti va so ca kho gathavisaye datthabbo, aharfi pure saiinamissaih sandhavissam anibbisaih etc'. 

- Rule 463 :- The word 'makaro' occurs in this rule. The sound 
'm' is augmented before the word akaro. 'M' is used as the sign. Thai, the translation of this rule is : In ajjattanivibhatti, the sound 'a' of vaca beccHnes 'o', such as : avoci avociih etc. 

- Rule 464 :- Like the preceding rule, here *also* augment occurs as a sign. The sound 'd' is augmented at the initial of icchi [kusasma dicchi]. This 'd' is then dropped 
- Rule 466 :- Tte word 'digho' occurs under this nile. In B. 

& S., this word does not occur. According to vutti, 'sometimes one 'ya' is elided and lengthening is applicable. For example :- jiyyati = jiyati, jiyyanti = jlyanti. Rup T., thCTefore se^ns to be better because therein we have direct injuncticHi about lengthening. 

- Rule 472 :- The word 'ucagamo' occurs in the stanza under this rule according to Rup T., B. &. S. It should be spilt as it is done in PUT. (p. 143), "u cagarao (va tthamhesuti tthamhesu va ukaragamo ca hotiti attho). The meaning is : 'u is *aiso* augmoited'. For example :- agamuttha. (VP. p. 546.). The similar explanaticm is found in Moggallana Vyakarana. (Mogg. p. 270 'mhatthanamun va hoti; agamumha, agamimha; agamuttha, agamittha.). The words 'mdcaro' and 'karato' [Rup T], should be joined together as in B. & S. 

- Rule 473 :- The word 'savuddhikabhuvadinayo' occurs after the rule 'niggahitanca' [473]. Rup T. & S. read as above. B. reads : 
'avuddhikabhuvadinayo'. According to Rup T. & S. the roots 'bhu' etc have vuddhi. But according to B. the roots *bhu' etc. would have no vuddhi. 

Rup T. & S. therefore are correct in supposing that the group of the roots 
'bhu' etc. have vuddhi. For Example :- bhu + a + ti = bhavati, hu + 
a + ti = hoti, si + a + ti = seti, sayati. (VP. p. 505). *\PUT.* p. 143. 

"savuddhikabhuvadito, tudadito ca paro apaccayo lopaih apajjatiti"]. 

- Rule 480 :- The words 'asa antalopo' occur under this rule. 

Rup T. reads as above. B. & S. read : asasma antalopoti ca adhikaro. 

The words 'asasma' and 'ca' are taken fncmi the following rule : 'asasma mimanaih mhimhantalopo ca* [483]. Rup T. has maintained the original form 
'asa'. But B. & S. have used it in the ablative case (pancami). 

- Rule 492 :- The words 'avuddhika' and 'bhuvadi' occur in the concluding stanza under this rule. Here according to the grammarian the roots 'bhu' etc. are to be known as fourfold : 1] avuddhika 2] tudadi-s 3] huvadi-s and 4] juhotyadi-s. The word 'avuddhika' means the roots having no vuddhi as : the roots da, dha etc. (PDT. p. 146, "Dadhadayo panettha avuddhikabhuvadayo.). For example :- adasi, dadhasi etc. (Rup T. p. 284.). For the word 'bhuvadi' [Rup T.], B. & S. read 'huvadi'. (Cf. Rup T. p. 281 "huvadayo"). 

- Rule 495 :- For the rule 'Tatha kattari ca' [Rup T.]. B. & 
S. read 'yatha kattari ca'. KcR (p. 237) and KCV. (p. 222) also read 
'yatha kattari ca'. The word yatha is indicating the comparision 
[upamanajotaka]. In the vutti, both words occur to indicate that even in the active sense, the suffix 'ya' is changed as well as in the impersonal and passive sense. This rule is 'nimittatidesasutta'. Therefore, the reading in B. & S. seems better. 

- Rule 526 :- The words 'evam uparipi' occur under this rule. 

According to FED., p. 145, and EPD. p. 2, 'upari' means above, over, upon. According to DPL. p. 531, 'upari' means above upon, over, upwards, beyond and *further.* It is. better to translate this word in this context as: 
'Similarly, even in the [context of] further [terminations]'. Because Rupasiddhi has given example only about the root 'gama' as 'so gamarii gamiyati, tena gamayiyati etc.' But even in the case of other roots, this rule is applicable. For example :- 'ghatantam, payojayati, ghatayati, ghatapeti 
- Rule 527 :- Rup T. reads : 'hanantam payojayatiti atthe'-
'nenayadayo namhiti vattate.' B. & S. read : 'hanantam payojayutiti atthe nenayadayo. Namhiti vattate.' 
For Rup T. the translation is : 'In the sense of 'one makes to kill'. 

The words nenayadayo and naihhi are understood For B. & S., translation is : 'the suffixes 'ne', 'naya' etc. are applicable in the sense of 'one makes to kill'. The word 'namhi' is understood It is better to read with B. & S. because the meaning becomes more clear as the suffixes ne and naya are applicable like payojeti payojayati etc. And the word 'namhi' is taken from the rule 'namhi rafijassa jo bhavakaranesuti' [563] [PDT. p. 157]. 

As the conclusion of akhytakanda, the grammarian [Buddhappiya] 
himself describes his composition 'for the benefit of the dispensation'. He refers to the roots divided into two groups as : 1] akammaka [intransitive] e. g. bhavati titthati, seti ahosi etc. 2] sakammaka [transitive] e. g. pivati, gacchati, neti etc. Even 'akammaka-dhatu' is used in the sense of sakammadhatu as in 'bhikkhu bhaveti maggaih ragadidusakarh'. Here the root 'bhu' is transitive [cf Sadd p. 554 'bhu pattiyam. patti papanam; sakammika dhatu]. Then, the grammarian also advises the scholars to think over it But this occurs only in Rup T. & B. It does not occur in S.
