When wishes (good wishes) are expressed dative is used for the person for whom they are expressed “may there be (hotu) long life for him” “good luck to you” bhaddaṃ bhavato hotu “welcome to you” svāgataṃ bhavato hotu svāgataṃ (“welcome!”) indeclinables sotthi “safety”, “safely” and namo (“hail!”) infinitive of verbs overlaps in meaning with the dative of purpose. idiomatic construction: proper time for something, the opportunity for something etassa kālo “it is the time for this”, “it is the right time for this” akālo … yācanāya “it is not the right time for asking” yassa dāni kālaṃ maññasi “for which you think it is now (dāni) the right time” extremely common in saying (formally) goodbye (spoken by the host, not the guest - who for his part has made the excuse of pressure of work), being roughly equivalent to “well, if you really must go … \" used also by servants reporting to their master that preparations are completed, implying “you can start whenever you wish”, etc 6. sāmivacana Genitive case:\nmay often be translated by “of”, and serves as a “possessive” case denoting the “possessor” (sāmin) the whole of which the related word denotes a part (avayava) immediately precedes the word to which it relates rañño thūpo A construction with a possessive genitive is very often equivalent to an English construction with the verb “to have” idaṃ assa hoti “of him thus it is …” (or was, etc.), “he has this thought …”, “he thinks thus …” tassa evaṃ hoti an idiom consisting of the genitive of the word denoting the period + accayena expresses the time after which (or through the passage of which) something is done: sattāhassa accayena … pabbajissāma “after I have passed away”, “after my death/parinibbāna” mama + accayena = “after me” agent-genitive (“subjective genitive”): brāhmaṇassa pūjito (Soṇadaṇḍo) “(Soṇadaṇḍo was) honoured of (= by) the priest” yesaṃ … devā …adiṭṭhā “those … who have not seen … the gods (negative participle: a-)” (“of (= by) whom the gods are unseen”; Commentary explains yesaṃ by yehi) patient-genitive (“objective genitive”): ahaṃ … tassa yaññassa yājetā “I … (was) the performer of that sacrifice” substitute for the instrumental kumbhiṃ … pūraṃ … suvaṇṇassa “pot … full … of gold” used with certain indeclinables, such as: piṭṭhito - “behind” purato - “before”, “in front of” antarena - “between” me purato - “in front of me” kāyānam antarena - “between the bodies” uttaraṃ nagarassa - “north of the city” The “genitive absolute” consists of a noun (or pronoun) followed by a participle, both inflected in the genitive. This nexus stands apart from the other words of the sentence and means “while (the noun was doing the participle)” special sense of disregarding: “despite (the noun doing the participle)”, “under their very noses,” as when the participle means “seeing”, “looking on” telassa jhāyamānassa “as (while) the oil is burning” mātāpitunnaṃ … rudantānaṃ … pabbajito “though his parents were weeping, he went forth” (i.e. “despite their weeping”) useful for constructing a sentence with two agents, but the similarly constructed locative absolute (Lesson 16) is much more frequently used 8. āmantaṇavacana, ālapanavacana Vocative:\nused “enclitically”, i.e. it does not stand at the beginning of a sentence guṇanāma Adjective:\nWhen an adjective is common to two or more nouns it may agree with the sum of these (and be plural) or with the nearest. Thirdly the qualified words may be taken as collective and singular and the adjective be singular. Where the genders conflict, the masculine takes precedence over the feminine, the neuter over both. An adjective usually precedes the noun it qualifies, but when there are several adjectives with one noun very often only one adjective precedes and the rest follow the noun. A demonstrative pronoun relating to the same noun will precede the whole group. When an adjective, or (all the) adjectives, follows its noun this usually indicates that it is being “predicated” of the noun, or in other words that the attribute in question is being emphasized. sabbanāma Pronouns\nniyamita Personal and Demonstrative (incomplete TBD)\nAlthough the person is expressed by the inflection of the verb, the pronouns of the first and second persons are frequently used, giving a slight emphasis to the subject. The third person pronoun is less often used in this way. The third personal pronoun is used also as a demonstrative, meaning “that”, “it”, in three genders. It is generally used as what is known as an “anaphoric \" pronoun, that is to say it refers back to someone or something previously mentioned in a narrative. As opposed to the use in conversation and other direct speech of “pronouns of presence” referring to someone or something present (“this man”, “that jar”), these pronouns are called “pronouns of absence” because it is most often used to speak of someone or something in a story and therefore not present to the listeners. It may serve to connect the sentences of a narrative into a continuous paragraph or longer section. It is used also as an emphatic pronoun (in combination with another pronoun or occasionally with 1st person, for example in the expression so ‘haṃ “I” (literally “that I”). In combination with a noun it is again emphatic and may sometimes be translated “the” There being no “definite article” in Pali the demonstrative pronouns are sometimes used where English would use the definite article, and may sometimes be translated “the” rather than “he”, “that”, “this”, etc. Demonstrative pronouns must agree in number and gender (and case) with the nouns to which they refer.

Some have remarked to my parents that they sense an aura of spirituality in me even when I was young, that I had what some called “an old soul.” I was not aware that I was different in any way, except I had a very strong sense of curiosity and loved learning new things and exploring places.\nMy parents were agnostic, so I was not brought up with a strong sense or awareness of religion. My mother said (many years later) she avoided taking me to visit places of worship or participate in religious ceremonies as she said someone (a monk? a soothsayer?) once told her I had a strong mind and may anger gods and deities with my presence.\nDiscovery of Buddhism When I was in my early teens, we visited Singapore and an uncle took us to a Buddhist temple. I can’t remember any details about the temple or any religious ceremony we may have attended, but my uncle gave me a book called “What Buddhists Believe” by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. Out of curiosity, I started reading the book that night and could not put it down until I finished.\nSuddenly, everything made sense to me. I had previously been exposed to Christianity and Islam, but didn’t understand why there was so much suffering and inequality in the world if there was a Creator. It did not seem fair to me that some are born rich and privileged but others seem to suffer their entire lives.\nI was also curious that often events and circumstances seemed to favour me naturally. I did well in school without trying very hard. I was popular and got along well with people. Things seem to fall into place that benefit me or propel me forward in life, and reflecting back I seem to have been gifted with good fortune for most of my life. Even setbacks often turn out to be beneficial in hindsight, painful though they may be at the time. It almost seemed unfair, as if I was somehow “cheating” and would need to pay back for it eventually.\nAt the same time, there were quite a few occasions that broke the pattern, when I did not not get what I wanted no matter how hard I wished for it. And it seemed the more I crave for it, the less likely it would occur. Over time, I’ve learnt to contain these intense disappointments, and to accept that I should not wish or desire too hard or it may never happen.\nI was already starting to ponder mortality, my own and others around me, and whether there was existence or continuation of life beyond death. I started craving and half wishing for an eternal soul, and worried that people I love will one day no longer be here, and things I love will be taken away from me. I started developing a sense of detachment and refrained from being too closely connected and perhaps loving too much.\nSo, the core concepts of Buddhism appealed greatly to me. They seemed to naturally answer all the questions I had, and the book did a great job explaining these concepts in a clear and easy to understand manner.\nBy the end of the book, I had convinced myself that I want to be a Buddhist. I remember having a long conversation with my father the day after sharing my joy and enthusiasm. I must have been quite evangelical, because I convinced him to read the book, and he also agreed with me that it made a lot of sense and we should both be Buddhists.\nSometime later, I also convinced my best friend in school, so I had a core set of people around me that were interested in Buddhism, gaining wisdom, and following the Noble Eightfold Path. However, I had no desire to join the Sangha and devote the rest of my life towards attaining nibbāna. I was not ready to renounce a normal life, and from the perspective of a teenager still in school, it did not seem like a practical choice and certainly not one that I thought my parents would approve or support.\nAdulthood My interest in Buddhism faded as I continued my life journey, and other things took priority. Finishing school, then university, getting married, working, enjoying life and sensual pleasures, doing what people normally do and what society expects me to do just seemed like the path of least resistance.\nAlthough I still remembered my interest in Buddhism, and had a desire to one day study the dhamma, and perhaps even learning Pali, I just did not have the time. Furthermore, it was difficult getting access to the Tipiṭaka, and many sections (including the Abhidhamma) have not been translated to English, and certainly not in book form.\nFor years, I would pester anyone I know visiting India or Sri Lanka to purchase Buddhism books for me, so I ended up amassing a collection that I have never read (until recently).\nMore recently, however, modern technology platforms and social media have reminded me that the Buddhist concepts of dukkha and tanhā are more relevant than ever. We are encouraged to become addicted to mindlessly consuming content that never truly satisfies, and develop wrong views about ourselves and others that result in more suffering. I became aware, with increasing dismay and horror, that technology panders to and amplifies our lowest desires and cravings. We have become obsessed with body image, what others think, giving ourselves to hedonistic pleasures, and not caring about anything other than instant gratification.\nRetirement In the last few years, I have gradually pulled myself from an active working life. I stopped working just before the COVID19 pandemic started in 2020. My original intention was to enjoy the rest of my life pursuing the things and activities that interested me, such as traveling, eating good food, watching movies, listening to music, and also indulging in my hobbies such as photography, music, art. My focus was to live each day of my life in happiness, doing the things I enjoy.\nAt the same time, I was also harbouring an ambition to make something that was meaningful. I was initially thinking of perhaps building and selling an app, and I had spent some time learning how to code and design web sites and apps.\nI was also making sure I was financially secure and able to live the rest of our lives without worrying about money or covering our living expenses. I had gradually stopped being interested in accumulating wealth or assets. In hindsight, I was slowly renouncing from worldly pleasures and cares without even realising it.\nIt occurred to me recently that perhaps it was an opportune time to resume my journey in studying dhamma. To my surprise, recent years have made core Buddhist texts much more accessible and the resources for studying them are easily obtainable.\nBoth my parents died, within months of each other, in 2021. Both of them died at peace, calm, and accepting, and without any suffering. In the last few years of their lives, they certainly seem to have progressed in their own journeys towards nibbāna and realisation. They seem more contented, happy with each other, and ridding themselves of the craving and suffering of their younger days. I like to think that perhaps both of them became Arahats moments before they died, and that they have finally unbound themselves from the endless cycle of sāmsara and reached the ultimate destination. I can only hope that I, too, can reach there before I die, and this website documents the remainder of my progress in that journey.\n","categories":"","description":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to date\n","excerpt":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/overview/journey/","tags":"","title":"My Journey along the aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/pa%C3%B1cup%C4%81d%C4%81nakkhandh%C4%81/","tags":"","title":"pañcupādānakkhandhā"},{"body":"--- markmap: zoom: false pan: false --- # pañcupādānakkhandhā ## rūpupādānakkhandho - form ## vedanupādānakkhandho - feeling ## saññupādānakkhandho - perception ## saṅkhārupādānakkhandho - choices (intentional activities) ## viññāṇupādānakkhandho - consciousness Reference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"five grasping aggregates\n","excerpt":"five grasping aggregates\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/5aggregates/","tags":["pañcupādānakkhandhā"],"title":"pañcupādānakkhandhā"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/pa%E1%B9%ADiccasamupp%C4%81da%E1%B9%81/","tags":"","title":"paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"},{"body":"stateDiagram-v2 [*] --\u003e avijjā avijjā --\u003e saṅkhārā saṅkhārā --\u003e viññāṇaṁ viññāṇaṁ --\u003e nāmarūpaṁ nāmarūpaṁ --\u003e saḷāyatanaṁ saḷāyatanaṁ --\u003e phasso phasso --\u003e vedanā vedanā --\u003e taṇhā taṇhā --\u003e upādānaṁ upādānaṁ --\u003e bhavo bhavo --\u003e jāti jāti --\u003e jarāmaraṇaṁ_sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā_sambhavanti jarāmaraṇaṁ_sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā_sambhavanti --\u003e [*] Reference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"dependent origination\n","excerpt":"dependent origination\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/pa%E1%B9%ADiccasamupp%C4%81da%E1%B9%81/","tags":["paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"],"title":"paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/sangaha/","tags":"","title":"sangaha"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/categories/sutta/","tags":"","title":"sutta"},{"body":" About buddhavacana This website documents my journey reading and studying Buddhist texts, primarily from the Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka) but also supplementary books and articles. My intent is to rely as much on the original Pāli terms and text where possible, and only rely on English translations as an interim aid to understanding. About Me Chris Tham, photo taken at Nan Tien Temple in 2014 My name is Chris Tham. I discovered Buddhism in my early teens, whilst visiting Singapore during a school vacation. An uncle took us to a Buddhist temple, and afterwards gave me a book called \"What Buddhists Believe\" by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. I read the whole book overnight and it all made sense to me, so I informally became a Buddhist after that.\nMuch later on, I stumbled upon another book called \"The Buddha's Explanation of the Universe\" by C.P. Ranasinghe which purports to explain in greater explain \"Life, the Universe, and Everything\" from a Buddhist perspective. These were taken from the Abhidhamma section of the Tipiṭaka. I wanted to study the original texts directly but at that time translations to English were not easily available. For years, I asked anyone who was visiting India or Sri Lanka to buy me books on the Abhidhamma and over the years I have a collected a few works but never the discourses themselves.\nWith a brand new translation of the Tipiṭaka now available on SuttaCentral I can finally study the actual text of the Tipiṭaka which has resulted in the creation of this site.\nAbout this website This website is hosted on Github using Github Pages.

Some scholars have speculated that it was either Magadhi or Magadhi-Prakrit considering his family background and where he was born. The Buddha probably preached the Dhamma in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Buddhist teachings were preserved and transmitted orally, and modern scholars believe over time Pāli evolved as a mix of the above languages, with the meanings of some words adapted to have specific Buddhist significance. As such, Pāli is a partially invented language used for the transmission and preservation of Buddhist theology, and is the canonical language of Buddhism.\nI have always wanted to study Buddhism, and in particular the Pāli Canon or Tipiṭaka, in Pāli rather than translated into English. This website summarises what I have learnt. I have tried to use diagrams such as mind maps whenever possible, and link to the actual discourses are available on SuttaCentral.\nIdamavoca bhagavā.
