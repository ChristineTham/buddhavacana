## The Buddha as a human being

The Buddha according to the Mahākhandhaka was a human being, with human failings and frailty. He was definitely not omniscient or a perfect human being (see [Was the Buddha Omniscient?](/buddhavacana/buddha/omniscient)). He made mistakes, such as not specifying the rules of the sangha precisely enough, and he had to keep correcting them and adding new rules to account for exceptions and special circumstances. He was almost certainly a misogynist and anti-LGBTQIA+. He inadvertently caused the suicide of some monks, and was unable to forsee or prevent disputes amongst monks, and even a schism in his lifetime. He can be angry at times, or petty (such as disparaging the beliefs of a monk on his deathbed and taunting Ānanda by saying Ānanda had missed the opportunity to ask the Buddha to prolong his life). He was vain, and not afraid to show off his physical perfections (32 marks of a great man), or flying around conducting miracles despite telling his followers not to show off their magical powers. Although we can write off a lot of these episodes as being invented after his death (particularly the ones about the 32 marks or displaying supernatural powers), it would seem strange that latter day followers would invent stories that do not portray him in a positive light or show his vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It seems that his imperfections, and his humanity, are important for us to understand and appreciate, so that we understand liberation is not a mystical or spiritual attainment, and in fact lapses are possible, and acceptable.

His followers, some of which are confirmed as having achieved liberation, occasionally seem to quarrel and disagree amongst themselves, even to the point of at least one leader declining to attend the First Council after his death, and preferring to keep his own opinion and memory of the Buddha's teachings.

The Buddha once nearly gave up on the saṅgha

Assaji (one of the original five disciples) visit the Buddha when old

The Buddha states that recollection of past lives is recollection of collections:
