This post is based on a helpful article written in Vietnamese: [Gõ chữ Pāḷi và Sanskrit trên máy tính MacOS & Windows](https://theravada.vn/danh-pali-va-sanskrit-tren-may-macos/) by Dhamma Nanda.

First of all, install the "ABC Extended input source in macOS. Open **System Preferences**, then click on **Language & Region** icon, then select the **Keyboard Preferences** button at the bottom. Click on the **Input Sources** tab, then click on the **+** button to add a new input source.

Select the **ABC Extended** Input source for the English language as per the following screenshot:

Make sure **ABC Extended** is the selected (or default) input source when you want to enter Pāli characters.

If you wish to enter a specific diacritic mark with a character, prefix the character with one of the following keystrokes (letter together with Opt/Alt/⌥ key):

|Diacritic|Prefix|Example|
|:-------:|:----:|:-----:|
|    ¯    | ⌥+a  |   ā   |
|    .    | ⌥+x  |   ṭ   |
|    ˙    | ⌥+w  |   ṫ   |
|    ˜    | ⌥+n  |   ñ   |
|    ´    | ⌥+e  |   ś   |

The ŋ (eng) character is entered as Opt+Shift+`;` followed by `n`. Other phonetic symbols are available when other keys are used together with Opt+Shift+`.` or Opt+Shift+`;`.
