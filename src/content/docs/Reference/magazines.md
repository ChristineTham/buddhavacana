[Wisdom Experience](https://wisdomexperience.org)
: Wisdom Publications is the leading publisher of books and online courses on contemporary and classic Buddhism, mindfulness, and meditation. Weâ€™re also the premier membership platform for Buddhists, having launched the Wisdom Experience in 2019 and now providing hundreds of hours of video and thousands of pages of books for our members to read online. Additionally, we publish the Wisdom Podcast and the Wisdom Journal.

[Tricycle](https://tricycle.org)
: Established in 1990 as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational organization, The Tricycle Foundation is dedicated to making Buddhist teachings and practices broadly available. In 1991 the Foundation launched Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, the first magazine intended to present Buddhist perspectives to a Western readership. Tricycle soon became the leading independent journal of Buddhism in the West, where it continues to be the most inclusive and widely read vehicle for the dissemination of Buddhist views and values. Our readership includes longtime practitioners, those who are curious about Buddhism or meditation, and those who do not identify as Buddhist but value the teachings of wisdom and compassion that Buddhism has to offer.

[Journal of Buddhist Ethics](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/)
: The Journal of Buddhist Ethics is the first academic journal dedicated entirely to Buddhist ethics. We promote the study of Buddhist ethics through the publication of research and book reviews and by hosting occasional online conferences.

[Institute of Buddhist Studies](https://www.shin-ibs.edu)
: Over the course of its long history of producing quality Buddhist Studies scholarship, IBS has collected several archives of scholarly journals and completed numerous publication and research projects. Browse some of these projects below.
