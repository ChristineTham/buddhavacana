The Buddha searched for the root cause of suffering, why do living beings suffer, why is there sickness, aging and death? This is the ultimate quest: when we find the answer, then we will no longer suffer. And he is right, for he discovered that each of us live in a universe constructed by us. Our conception of who we are and the world we live in is based on our aggregated perceptions of phenomena. Once we let go, we will be liberated.

## Is this just mumbo jumbo and gobbledegook?

No, it is not. The Buddha was not a magician, he was not a "spiritualist", he was not a holy man or religious teacher, he is not a divine omniscient being incapable of farting. Or at least he did not have the intention to be regarded as such, however many gradually saw him as all that, and more.

He was not advocating eternal peace and happiness, an everlasting life, a spiritual attainment. He was not "enlightened" nor did he achieve "perfect understanding" - these are just epithets bestowed upon him by his followers, who by and large have misunderstood his teachings.

He did not search for a metaphysical end to suffering, he was looking for the actual end to suffering. And he found it. And so can we, each one of us. There is nothing "divine" or "holy" or "celestial" about ending suffering - yes, in this very lifetime, not in some future birth in a heavenly realm.

The Buddha's "achievement" (end of suffering) can be replicated by us, through following his footsteps. We need to search of the root cause of suffering within ourselves, for "suffering" means differently for everyone, based on their perceptions generated within their constructed universe made up of observed phenomena that together form their view of themselves.

We "create" our own suffering. And because of that, we can end our suffering.

## But wait, didn't the Buddha fell sick, aged, and died?

Yes, he did. And so will all of us.

Ask yourself this question. Who is is that cares about suffering, sickness, aging and death?

After all, we are physically just a collection of atoms. When we die, those atoms (most of them anyway) will still exist, but possibly rearranged in new configurations.

So why does it matter? Why is it so important not to suffer?

## The search for the self

The Buddha probably started by trying to answer two questions: "What causes `dukkha`?", and "Who experiences `dukkha`?" or more colloquially "Who suffers?"

For the first question ("What causes `dukkha`?") the Buddha traced the origin of `dukkha` by progressively working backwards through a set of linked causes. He started by observing that the ultimate "suffering", ie. aging and death, is an inevitable consequence of life. All living beings will eventually age and die, therefore the cause of `dukkha` can be traced right back to the birth of living beings. All the other forms of `dukkha`, such as sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, can similarly be traced back to conception and birth, for if we had not been born we would not experience any `dukkha`.

But what causes birth? The Buddha determined this is the survival instinct, or will to live. This "will to live" is fueled by a clinging or attachment to life, which in turn is caused by a craving or innate desire to live, and to continue living.

What generates this craving? It is caused by our accumulated feelings, our experiences, originating from our senses, triggered by the external world and from our consciousness itself.

What of consciousness itself? The Buddha tackled this question by asking the second question: "Who experiences `dukkha`?"

For there to be `dukkha`, there must be "someone" who is affected by, and experiences `dukkha`. So the Buddha started to investigate the nature of "the self", or our notion of personal identity and "selfhood."

The Buddha came to the (logical) conclusion that our sense of "self" is generated from our subjective experiences (phenomena) and our accumulated thoughts. In other words, our "consciousness" is "constructed" and ephemeral. Furthermore, we are unaware or ignorant of the "constructed" or transient nature of our consciousness, and hence ignorance is the ultimate cause of `dukkha`.

The Buddha's concept of consciousness is similar to "artificial intelligence" - we behave like a neural network "trained" on sensory input and generates "responses" that impact our bodies and influences future reactions and responses. Our "self" and "sentience" is therefore also generated - it is a survival instinct to enable us to cope and respond to the world around us.

This was a radical and original idea formulated by the Buddha, different from other beliefs common during his time. It predates many modern philosophical theories. The Buddha was quite possibly the world's first "phenomenologist".

According to the Buddha, what we regard as a "self" is nothing more than the sum total of all our accumulated memories of perceptual phenomena, sensory stimuli, feelings, emotions, apperceptions, thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and other mental constructs.

## The phenomenal nature of our experienced life

The Buddha's viewpoint can be described as "phenomenalism" -  everything we experience is through our senses and our imagination. Because of that. we are unable to determine whether the real world or physical universe actually exists. Our "world" is effectively a mental construct, formed from previous experiences, apperceptions, influenced and shaped by language (we "name" things that we can perceive). Therefore our "self" also is named and constructed.

The Buddha points out that this "self" and all the mental constructs are impermanent. They have no existence outside of our minds, and disappear when we die. Therefore the "world" that we perceive is also impermanent, because it is nothing more than a mental construction.

It is important to clarify that the Buddha did not deny the existence of the physical universe (contrary to what some Buddhists believe - that the "world" is an illusion), nor did he deny the possible existence of a metaphysical self which is greater than, and possibly separate from, the constructed self. He simply points out that it is impossible for us to verify or refute these abstract or metaphysical concepts. Nor did he deny the possibility of a Creator of the universe, or the existence of other universes and realms, or the existence of beings superior or inferior to ourselves, such as gods and demons. However, I suggest these concepts are ultimately irrelevant in the soteriology - they have no impact on whether we can eliminate or avoid `dukkha`.

The Buddha's solution turned out to be surprisingly "simple". If our sense of self is constructed, then `dukkha` is also a mental construction. In other words, the "sufferer" self-generates suffering. It is our "ignorance" of the constructed nature of our consciousness that ultimately causes `dukkha`. Therefore, to avoid `dukkha`, the "sufferer" simply has to stop generating thoughts or performing actions that will inevitably lead to suffering.

## Yes, but does it really work?

Potentially one can imagine this would work with a sense of unease or dissatisfaction. One also could argue that grief or loss is an emotion that can be dealt with, and even physical pain can be ignored. Can we truly avoid or eliminate sickness, old age and death?

Crucially, this is where the Buddha's concept of phenomenalism comes in. Given we cannot verify or substantiate the physical universe, illness, old age and death are just concepts in our minds, and we suffer because we find these concepts distasteful. If we can treat them as mere phenomena and not react to them, we avoid `dukkha` altogether. We accept that whatever happens happens, and at the end of the day everything is just a construction.

The Buddha's soteriological goal can be likened to giving up smoking. We understand that smoking is bad for us. The solution is deceptively simple: just stop smoking. However, many people find this is difficult to do. Ingrained habits and addiction are hard to change or stop. However, once the objective is accomplished, nothing further needs to be done (apart from guarding against the danger of a relapse).

In the same way, we understand that `dukkha` is not pleasant. The solution is deceptively simple: just stop generating thoughts or performing actions that will lead to `dukkha`. However, many people find this is difficult to do. Ingrained habits and desires are hard to change or stop. However, once the objective is accomplished, nothing further needs to be done (apart from guarding against the danger of a relapse).

## In summary

"It's all in the mind, just let it go." By doing so, one is relieved from the burden of `dukkha`, one is no longer concerned by `dukkha`, one is therefore liberated from `dukkha` and it is extinguished.

## Still not satisfied?
