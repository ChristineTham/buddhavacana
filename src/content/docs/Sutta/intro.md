  Core Teachings
---

This section of the website provides summaries of what is considered the core teachings of the Buddha, which are topics common across the canons of the various sects of Buddhism, and hence presumed to reflect a presectarian view of what the Buddha might have taught.

Various scholars such as André Migot, Edward J. Thomas, Erich Frauwallner, Rupert Gethin, and Johannes Bronkhorst have speculated that the Abhidharma of various sects were based on early and ancient lists of doctrinal terms which are called `mātikā` ([S]`mātṛkā`).

According Frauwallner[^Frauwallner1996] in pg. 3:

> The oldest Buddhist tradition has no Abhidharmapitaka but only mātṛkā. What this means is that besides the small number of fundamental doctrinal statements, the Buddha's sermons also contain a quantity of doctrinal concepts. The most suitable form for collecting and preserving these concepts would have been comprehensive lists. Lists of this kind were called mātṛkā, and it was from these lists that the Abhidharma later developed.

[^Frauwallner1996]: Frauwallner, Erich. Kidd, Sophie Francis (translator). Steinkellner, Ernst (editor) 1996. Studies in Abhidharma Literature and the Origins of Buddhist Philosophical Systems. SUNY Press. pp. 18, 100.

The following diagram shows the relationship between the various topics across the mātikās of the Abhidhamma texts of three schools (Theravāda Vibhaṅga, Sarvāstivāda Dharmaskandha, Dharmagupta Śāriputrābhidharma), originally identified by Frauwallner[^Frauwallner1996] and subsequently summarised by Sujato. The terms in **bold** are common across the mātikās and hence assumed to be pre-sectarian.

## 37 awakening qualities

According to Analayo[^Analayo2014], another important doctrinal list which appears in the early texts is the "thirty seven qualities that are conducive to awakening" (`bodhipākṣikā dharmāḥ`).[^Analayo2014] This mātṛkā appears in various sūtras, like the Pāsādika-sutta, the Sāmagāma-sutta (and their parallels), and in the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra, where it is said to have been taught by the Buddha just before passing away.
