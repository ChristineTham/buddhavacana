*   Indian philosophy was profoundly shaped by the implicit belief that language and reality are deeply intertwined, a different "mental equipment" (*outillage mental*) from that of modern philosophers.
*   **Brahmanical thinkers** believed Sanskrit was the only correct language, naturally linked to reality. The Veda, being authorless and eternal, contained sacred formulas (*mantras*) that could directly affect the world. This led to arguments that something must exist simply because a word for it exists in Sanskrit.
*   **Buddhist thinkers** came to believe that the world of our experience is largely a construct of language. They held that only ultimate, momentary constituents (*dharmas*) were real, and that common-sense objects (like houses or chariots) were unreal concepts created by words.
*   Both traditions, despite different starting points, accepted that our common-sense world is created by language. This shared belief influenced their arguments.
*   A key implicit belief, the **correspondence principle**, held that a statement refers to a situation made up of the things designated by its words.
*   This principle created a paradox for statements about production, such as "the potter makes a pot." For the statement to be true, a pot must be part of the situation, but the pot does not yet exist.
*   The Buddhist thinker **Nāgārjuna** used this paradox to argue that the phenomenal world is self-contradictory and therefore does not truly exist.
*   The Brahmanical **Sāṃkhya** school resolved the paradox by proposing that the effect pre-exists in the cause (*sat-kārya-vāda*), meaning the pot must already exist in the clay.
*   Other Brahmanical thinkers, like **Gauḍapāda**, used the paradox to argue that nothing ever truly comes into being and that phenomenal reality is an illusion.
*   **Jaina thinkers** addressed the problem with their doctrine of manifold reality (*an-ekānta-vāda*), arguing that from different perspectives, a thing can be said to be both existing (as its material cause) and non-existing (as its new form) simultaneously.
