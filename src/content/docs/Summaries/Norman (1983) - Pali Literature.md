This summary is generated by Google Gemini Pro 2.5 based on the book's content and may not capture all nuances. For a complete understanding, please refer to the original work.
:::

*   It covers the canonical literature in Pāli, Prakrit, and Sanskrit of all Hīnayāna schools of Buddhism.
*   The book's contents are divided into chapters covering the Pāli language and tradition, the Pāli Canon (Vinaya, Sutta, and Abhidhamma piṭakas), and early and later post-canonical texts.
*   The author focuses on works that have been edited in Roman script or translated into a European language, acknowledging a lack of coverage for South-East Asian Pāli literature.
*   The foreword notes that the book does not delve deeply into the chronological stratification of texts due to space constraints and the subjective nature of the topic.
*   It references the more detailed works of scholars like Geiger, Winternitz, Law, Malalasekera, and Bode.

# CHAPTER I - THE PĀLI LANGUAGE AND THE THERAVĀDIN TRADITION

## 1. THE NAME "PĀLI"

*   The word "Pāli" is not used to name the language within the Theravādin canon itself.
*   In commentaries, the word *pāli* means "canon" or "canonical text," as opposed to the commentary on it.
*   The name "Pāli" for the language likely originated from a misunderstanding of the term *pāli-bhāsā* ("language of the canon").
*   This usage was noted in Thailand in the late 17th century and was adopted by European scholars in the 19th century from Sinhalese practice.

## 2. THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PĀLI LANGUAGE

*   Commentaries identify the language of the canon as Māgadhī, the Buddha's native tongue, but linguistic analysis shows Pāli is not pure Māgadhī.
*   Pāli is a composite language, showing evidence of transmission through various Middle Indo-Aryan dialects before being standardized.
*   The Buddha likely preached in local dialects, which were later collected and redacted into a normalized, ecclesiastical language.
*   This language underwent partial Sanskritisation before being committed to writing in the first century B.C.
*   Over centuries, Pāli was further influenced by grammarians, scribal traditions, and the native languages of countries where it was studied, such as Sinhalese, Burmese, and Thai.

## 3. THE HISTORY OF THE THERAVĀDIN TRADITION

*   The First Council was held after the Buddha's death to recite and establish the Dhamma and Vinaya through an oral tradition.
*   Specialist reciters (*bhānakas*) were tasked with memorizing and transmitting different parts of the canon, which sometimes led to variations between texts.
*   A Second Council addressed disciplinary issues and resulted in the first major schism, with the Mahāsānghikas splitting from the Theravādins.
*   A Third Council was held during the reign of Asoka.
*   The Pāli canon was first written down in Ceylon in the first century B.C. during the reign of Vaṭṭagāmaṇī Abhaya, an event some traditions call the Fourth Council.
*   Buddhism spread to Burma and Siam (Thailand), leading to a continuous exchange of texts and monastic traditions with Ceylon.
*   Later councils were held to purify the texts, including a Fifth Council in Burma (1868-71) and a Sixth Council in Rangoon (1954-56), which produced a modern standardized edition of the Tipiṭaka.

# CHAPTER II - THE PĀLI CANON

*   The Pāli Canon can be classified in several ways: as two parts (dhamma and vinaya), three baskets (*piṭakas*), five collections (*nikāyas*), or nine literary types (*angas*).
*   The nine *angas* (e.g., *sutta*, *geyya*, *gāthā*) were an early classification describing different types of text rather than specific books.
*   The most common modern division is into three *piṭakas*: the Vinaya-piṭaka, Sutta-piṭaka, and Abhidhamma-piṭaka.
*   The Sarvāstivādin school also had a three-piṭaka canon with the same names, indicating this division predates the schism between the schools.

## 2. THE VINAYA-PIṬAKA

*   The Vinaya-piṭaka, or "Basket of Discipline," is divided into three sections: the Suttavibhanga, the Khandhaka, and the Parivāra.
*   **Suttavibhanga**:
    *   Contains the Pātimokkha, a set of 227 rules for monks and 311 for nuns.
    *   Each rule is typically presented with a story of its origin, the rule itself, a word-by-word analysis called the "Old Commentary," and stories of deviations.
    *   Other early Buddhist schools had similar texts, with minor variations in the rules.
*   **Khandhaka**:
    *   Comprises the Mahāvagga and Cullavagga.
    *   Contains rules for the Sangha's conduct, arranged by subject (e.g., medicines, robes) within a biographical framework of the Buddha.
    *   It also includes rules for nuns and historical accounts of the first two Buddhist councils.
    *   The Mahāvastu of the Mahāsānghika-Lokottaravādin school is a related text but is more biographical and contains fewer monastic rules.
*   **Parivāra**:
    *   An appendix or supplement to the Vinaya, possibly composed in Ceylon.
    *   It summarizes and analyzes the Vinaya rules in 19 chapters, often using a question-and-answer or numerical format.
    *   Its canonical status was not accepted by all schools.

## 3. THE SUTTA-PIṬAKA

*   The Sutta-piṭaka, or "Basket of Discourses," consists of five collections (*nikāyas*).
*   The first four nikāyas are arranged by the length or content of the discourses (*suttas*):
    *   **Dīgha-nikāya**: Contains 34 long discourses, including legends, ethical teachings, and accounts of the Buddha's last days (Mahāparinibbānasutta).
    *   **Majjhima-nikāya**: Contains 152 middle-length discourses, including autobiographical accounts of the Buddha, narrative stories, and doctrinal discussions.
    *   **Saṃyutta-nikāya**: Contains thousands of short suttas grouped or "connected" (*saṃyutta*) by topic, such as a specific doctrine, person, or class of being.
    *   **Añguttara-nikāya**: Contains suttas arranged in eleven sections based on the number of items discussed, from one to eleven.
*   The fifth collection, the **Khuddaka-nikāya** ("Miscellaneous Collection"), contains fifteen distinct texts of varying age and content:
    *   **Khuddakapāṭha**: A short handbook for novices compiled from other parts of the canon.
    *   **Dhammapada**: A famous collection of 423 ethical verses.
    *   **Udāna**: A collection of 80 solemn utterances made by the Buddha.
    *   **Itivuttaka**: 112 short discourses in a mix of prose and verse.
    *   **Suttanipāta**: A collection of discourses in verse, containing some of the oldest material in the canon.
    *   **Vimānavatthu** and **Petavatthu**: Stories describing heavenly rewards for good deeds and the suffering of ghosts due to bad deeds.
    *   **Theragāthā** and **Therīgāthā**: "Verses of the Elder Monks" and "Verses of the Elder Nuns," containing personal poems about their religious experiences.
    *   **Jātaka**: A collection of over 500 stories of the Buddha's previous births, where only the verses are considered canonical.
    *   **Niddesa**: A canonical commentary on parts of the Suttanipāta.
    *   **Paṭisambhidāmagga**: A systematic, Abhidhamma-style analysis of key Buddhist doctrines.
    *   **Apadāna**: A collection of verse legends about the past lives of eminent monks and nuns.
    *   **Buddhavamsa**: A "Chronicle of Buddhas" detailing the lives of the 24 Buddhas who preceded Gotama.
    *   **Cariyāpiṭaka**: A collection of Jātaka-style stories illustrating the ten perfections of a Bodhisatta.

## 4. THE ABHIDHAMMA-PIṬAKA

*   The Abhidhamma-piṭaka, or "Basket of Higher Doctrine," is considered a later addition to the canon and contains systematic analyses of Buddhist doctrine.
*   It consists of seven books, which were developed independently from the Abhidharma texts of other schools like the Sarvāstivādins.
*   The seven books are:
    *   **Dhammasangani**: An enumeration and definition of all mental and material states (*dhammas*).
    *   **Vibhanga**: An analysis of 18 major topics (e.g., aggregates, truths) from both a discourse (Sutta) and a technical (Abhidhamma) perspective.
    *   **Dhātukathā**: A detailed examination of the relationships between psychical phenomena, classified under aggregates, bases, and elements.
    *   **Puggala-paññatti**: A classification of different types of individuals, similar in style to the Añguttara-nikāya.
    *   **Kathāvatthu**: A refutation of heretical doctrines, traditionally said to have been compiled by Tissa at the Third Buddhist Council.
    *   **Yamaka**: The "Book of Pairs," a text on applied logic that examines topics through a thesis and its opposite.
    *   **Paṭthāna**: The longest book, which provides an exhaustive analysis of the 24 types of causal relations between all phenomena.

# CHAPTER III - EARLY POST-CANONICAL TEXTS

## 1. EARLY PROSE TEXTS

*   **Petakopadesa:** An early treatise on hermeneutics (interpreting suttas), ascribed to Kaccāna but not the Buddha's disciple. It was likely composed in India before the 2nd century B.C. and teaches a method for correctly rephrasing Buddhist teachings using 16 modes (*hāras*) and five guidelines (*nayas*).
*   **Nettippakarana:** A guide for writing commentaries, considered a rewritten and improved version of the *Petakopadesa*. Its use of the Āryā metre suggests a North Indian origin before the Christian era. It greatly influenced later commentators, including Buddhaghosa.
*   **Milindapañha:** A dialogue between the Greek king Milinda (Menander) and the thera Nāgasena, composed between the 2nd century B.C. and the 5th century A.D. It is thought to be a Pāli translation of a North Indian original and is composed of material from different periods.
*   **Vimuttimagga:** An early text by Upatissa that was used by Buddhaghosa when writing the *Visuddhimagga*. The Pāli original may be lost, but a Chinese translation exists. It is shorter than the *Visuddhimagga* and organises its content under the three headings of sīla (morality), samādhi (concentration), and paññā (wisdom).

## 2. THE EARLY CHRONICLES

*   **Dīpavamsa:** The first extant verse chronicle (*vamsa*) of Ceylon, covering its history from the Buddha's time to the 4th century A.D. It appears to be a compilation of various, sometimes overlapping, sources and is written in a difficult style of Pāli.
*   **Bāhiranidāna:** An introduction to Buddhaghosa's Vinaya commentary, the *Samantapāsādikā*. It is based on the same historical materials as the *Dīpavamsa* but integrates the different source versions more successfully.
*   **Mahāvamsa:** A chronicle by Mahānāma, written to be a more polished and coherent replacement for earlier works like the *Dīpavamsa*. It covers the same historical period but is superior in literary style and is considered an epic poem (*kāvya*). The original work ends in the middle of chapter XXXVII.

## 3. THE EARLY COMMENTARIES

*   According to tradition, the commentaries (* atthakathās*) were brought to Ceylon by Mahinda and translated into the Sinhalese language.
*   Some commentarial material is very old, possibly predating the schisms between Buddhist sects.
*   The commentators based their work on a mass of disjointed material from various sources, sometimes including contradictory explanations.

### 3.1. Buddhaghosa

*   A prolific commentator from the first half of the 5th century A.D. who translated the Sinhalese commentaries into Pāli.
*   **Visuddhimagga:** His most famous work, an encyclopedic compendium of Buddhist doctrine structured around sīla, samādhi, and paññā. It served as a detailed manual for meditation masters.
*   **Nikāya and Vinaya Commentaries:** He wrote the *Samantapāsādikā* (Vinaya), *Sumañgalavilāsinī* (Dīgha-nikāya), *Papañcasūdanī* (Majjhima-nikāya), *Sāratthappakāsinī* (Saṃyutta-nikāya), and *Manorathapūranī* (Añguttara-nikāya).
*   **Abhidhamma Commentaries:** He wrote the *Atthasālinī* (Dhammasañgani), *Sammohavinodanī* (Vibhanga), and the *Pañcappakaraṇaṭthakathā* (for the remaining five books). His commentary on the *Kathāvatthu* is notable for identifying the schools associated with various heretical views.
*   **Other Commentaries:** The *Kaṅkhāvitaranī* (Pātimokkha commentary) and commentaries on the *Dhammapada*, *Jātaka*, *Khuddakapāṭha*, and *Suttanipāta* are also attributed to him, though authorship of the latter group is sometimes debated due to stylistic differences.

### 3.2. Buddhadatta

*   A contemporary of Buddhaghosa who wrote summaries of canonical texts, possibly based on the same Sinhalese commentaries used by Buddhaghosa.
*   His works include the *Vinayavinicchaya* and *Uttaravinicchaya* (summaries of the Vinaya) and the *Abhidhammāvatāra* and *Rūpārūpavibhāga* (summaries of the Abhidhamma).
*   He composed his works in South India during the reign of King Acyutavikrama of the Kalamba clan.

### 3.3. Mahānāma

*   Author of the *Saddhammappakāsinī*, a commentary on the *Paṭisambhidāmagga*, written in the 6th century A.D.
*   As there was likely no existing Sinhalese commentary for this text, he borrowed extensively from Buddhaghosa's *Visuddhimagga*.

### 3.4. Upasena

*   Author of the *Saddhammappajotikā*, a commentary on the *Niddesa*, written around the middle of the 6th century A.D.
*   He borrowed material from Buddhaghosa's *Visuddhimagga* and *Sammohavinodanī*, as well as the commentary on the *Suttanipāta*.

### 3.5. Dhammapāla

*   A commentator from South India who worked around the middle of the 6th century A.D. and aimed to complete the commentaries on the *Khuddaka-nikāya*.
*   His commentaries are collectively called *Paramatthadīpanī* and cover the *Udāna*, *Itivuttaka*, *Petavatthu*, *Vimānavatthu*, *Theragāthā*, *Therīgāthā*, and *Cariyāpiṭaka*.
*   He also wrote a commentary on the *Nettippakaraṇa*.
*   He based his work on the Mahāvihāra tradition and often used Buddhaghosa's works without attribution. His commentaries frequently include introductory stories and word-for-word explanations of verses.

# Chapter IV - LATER POST-CANONICAL TEXTS

## 1. THE LATER CHRONICLES

*   The *Vamsatthappakāsinī* is a commentary (*ṭīkā*) on the *Mahāvaṃsa*, written around the 8th or 9th century AD by an unnamed author.
*   It used various sources, including the *Sīhala atthakathā* and even texts from the rival Abhayagirivihāra, indicating some interaction between the sects.
*   The *Cūlavaṃsa* is the continuation of the *Mahāvaṃsa*, written in several parts over centuries, covering the period from King Mahāsena's death to the arrival of the English in 1815.
*   The *Mahābodhivaṃsa*, attributed to Upatissa (10th century AD), is a prose work in Sanskritised Pāli about the history of the bodhi tree.
*   The *Dāṭhāvaṃsa*, by Dhammakitti (c. 1211 AD), is a poem of high literary merit detailing the history of the tooth relic.
*   The *Thūpavaṃsa*, by Vācissara (13th century AD), focuses on the building of the Mahāthūpa by Duṭṭhagāmaṇī.
*   Other chronicles include the *Hatthavanagalla-vihāra-vamsa* (13th century), the Burmese *Cha-kesa-dhātu-vamsa*, and the Thai *Jinakālamālī* (by Ratanapañña, c. 1516-1527 AD), which chronicles Buddhism in India, Ceylon, and Southeast Asia.
*   Later historical texts include the Thai *Sangītivaṃsa* (18th century), the *Sandesakathā* (c. 1801 AD), and the *Buddhaghosuppatti*, a 14th-century historical romance from Burma.

## 2. THE LATER COMMENTARIES

### 2.1. Atṭhakathās

*   The *Madhuratthavilāsinī*, a commentary on the *Buddhavamsa*, is attributed to Buddhadatta but may be by a later author.
*   The *Visuddhajanavilāsinī* is an anonymous commentary on the *Apadāna* and is later than Dhammapāla. It does not comment on the *Therīapādāna* section.
*   The *Mohavicchedanī*, by Kassapa (c. 1160-1230 AD), is a commentary on the matrices (*mātikās*) of the Abhidhamma-piṭaka that expounds the entire Abhidhamma system.

### 2.2. Tīkās

*   A *ṭīkā* is a secondary commentary, i.e., a commentary upon a commentary.
*   Evidence suggests *ṭīkās* existed much earlier than the 12th century.
*   The *ṭīkā* on the *Visuddhimagga*, likely by a different Dhammapāla than the one who wrote the * atthakathās*, dates to the late 10th century AD.
*   The *Milinda-ṭīkā*, by Mahātipiṭaka-Cūḷābhayatthera (c. 1474 AD), comments on the *Milindapañha* and suggests Buddhaghosa composed or revised parts of it.
*   Commentaries were classified as early (*purāṇa*) and later (*nava*) *ṭīkās*, with further supplements called *anuṭīkās*.

## 3. LATER ABHIDHAMMA TEXTS

*   The *Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha*, by Anuruddha (11th-12th century), is a famous and highly condensed manual covering the entire field of Abhidhamma.
*   Anuruddha also wrote the *Nāmarūpapariccheda* and possibly the *Paramatthavinicchaya*.
*   Other manuals include the *Saccasaṅkhepa* by Culladhammapāla and the *Nāmarūpasamāsa* by Khema.
*   These and other works form a group known in Burma as the "Little-finger Manuals" (*Let-than*).

## 4. COLLECTIONS OF EDIFYING TALES

*   This genre of literature emphasizes the merit of giving (*dāna*).
*   The *Dasavatthuppakaraṇa* contains stories illustrating the benefits of ten types of gifts to the Sangha.
*   The *Sīhalavatthuppakaraṇa* is a collection of 77 stories, mostly set in Ceylon, glorifying donors.
*   The *Sahassavatthuppakaraṇa* contains 95 stories from India and Ceylon and appears to be a translation from Sinhalese.
*   The *Rasavāhinī*, by Vedeha (13th-14th century), is a revision of an earlier work, containing 40 stories from India and 63 from Ceylon.

## 5. KĀVYA WORKS

*   This period saw Pāli literature influenced by Sanskrit ornate poetry (*kāvya*).
*   The *Telakaṭāhagāthā* is a poem of 98 stanzas on Buddhist doctrines, supposedly recited by a thera facing execution.
*   The *Jinālaṅkāra*, by Buddharakkhita (c. 1156 AD), is a highly stylized poem on the Buddha's life, using literary devices like palindromes.
*   The *Jinacarita*, by Medhankara (13th century), is another poem on the Buddha's life, based mainly on the *Nidānakathā*.
*   The *Pajjamadhu*, by Buddhappiya (13th-14th century), is a poem of 104 stanzas praising the Buddha's physical beauty and wisdom.
*   The *Samantakūṭavaṇnanā*, by Vedeha (13th-14th century), describes the Buddha's life, culminating in his visit to Ceylon.
*   The *Saddhammopāyana* (13th century) and *Pañcagatidīpana* (14th century) are poems dealing with Buddhist ethical doctrines and the five realms of rebirth, respectively.

## 6. PROPHETIC TEXTS

*   These texts focus on the future Buddha, Metteyya.
*   The *Anāgatavaṃsa*, a poem ascribed to Kassapa, describes the coming of Metteyya and the decline of Buddhism.
*   The *Dasabodhisattuppattikathā* (late 14th century) tells of ten future Buddhas and shows Mahāyāna influence through its stories of self-sacrifice.
*   Other related texts include the *Dasabodhisattuddesa* and the *Samantabhaddikā*, a commentary on the *Anāgatavaṃsa*.

## 7. MEDICAL TEXTS

*   The origins of Pāli medical texts are in the *Bhesajjakkhandaka* of the Vinaya-piṭaka.
*   The only extant Pāli medical text is the *Bhesajjamañjūsā*, written by Atthadassi around 1267 AD.
*   Its stated purpose was to help those in the spiritual life avoid illness.

## 8. GRAMMATICAL AND LEXICOGRAPHICAL WORKS

*   The earliest known Pāli grammar is by Kaccāyana, which was influenced by Sanskrit works like Pāṇini's grammar.
*   The *Saddanīti*, by Aggavaṃsa of Burma (1154 AD), is considered the greatest extant Pāli grammar.
*   Moggallāna founded a new school of grammar around 1165 AD with his more exhaustive *Moggallāyanavyākaraṇa*.
*   The earliest Pāli dictionary is the *Abhidhānappadīpikā* by Navamoggallāna (late 12th century), a dictionary of synonyms modeled on the Sanskrit *Amarakośa*.
*   The *Ekakkharakosa* (1465 AD) is a metrical list of monosyllabic words.

## 9. POETICS AND PROSODY

*   The thera Sangharakkhita (late 12th century) composed several works on rhetoric and metre based on Sanskrit models.
*   His *Subodhālañkāra* is a work on poetics, covering composition, ornamentation, and figures of speech.
*   His *Vuttodaya* is the only known original work on Pāli metre.
*   He also wrote the *Sambandhacintā*, a work on the Pāli verb and syntax.

## 10. BOOKS ON DISCIPLINE

*   The *Khuddasikkhā* and *Mūlasikkhā* are compendiums of the Vinaya-piṭaka, mostly in verse, designed to make the rules easier to learn.
*   The *Upāsakajanālañkāra*, by Ānanda (12th century), is the only systematic Pāli text on the proper conduct for a layperson, compiling instructions from the canon and commentaries.

## 11. BOUNDARY TEXTS

*   Texts were written to address legalistic issues concerning monastic boundaries (*sīmā*).
*   The *Sīmālañkāra* by Vācissara and its summary, the *Sīmāsaṅgaha*, were key texts from the 13th century.
*   The continuing importance of the subject is shown by later works like the *Sīmāsaṅkarachedanī* (15th century) and the *Sīmāvivādavinicchayakathā* (early 19th century).

## 12. ANTHOLOGIES

*   The *Suttasaṅgaha* is an early anthology of suttas, considered canonical in Burma, arranged by topics such as giving (*dāna*) and morality (*sīla*).
*   The *Sārasaṅgaha*, by Siddhattha (13th-14th century), contains 40 chapters on Buddhist topics, illustrated with stories.
*   The *Paritta* is a collection of protective texts from the Suttapiṭaka chanted as charms. Collections vary, with a longer set of 28 known as the *Catubhāṇavāra*.

## 13. COSMOLOGY

*   The oldest Pāli text on cosmology is the *Lokapaññatti*, likely written in Burma in the 11th or 12th century.
*   It is a compilation of information and stories about the world, drawing from the Sanskrit *Lokaprajñapti*, the *Mahāvastu*, and the Pāli canon.
*   A later Thai work on the subject is the *Cakkavāladīpanī* (1520 AD).

## 14. WISDOM TEXTS

*   *Nīti* texts, collections of aphorisms on worldly wisdom, were popular in Burma.
*   The earliest is likely the *Dhammanīti* (14th-15th century), followed by the *Lokanīti* and *Mahārahanīti*.
*   These are compilations of verses from other Pāli texts (like the Jātaka) and adaptations from Sanskrit sources, especially those attributed to Cānakya.

## 15. JĀTAKA COLLECTIONS

*   The *Paññāsa-jātaka* is a non-canonical collection of 50 Jātaka stories, with Thai, Cambodian, and Burmese versions.
*   The stories draw on motifs from the canonical Jātakas, Buddhist Sanskrit texts, and local folk literature.
*   The *Kosala-bimba-vaṇṇanā* (13th-14th century) is a work justifying the practice of making Buddha images, told in the style of a Jātaka story.

## 16. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORKS

*   Some later chronicles function as histories of literature.
*   The *Saddhammasaṅgaha* (late 14th century) gives an account of Buddhism and lists principal literary works.
*   The *Gandhavaṃsa* (17th century Burma) provides a brief history of the canon and post-canonical books, listing authors and their works.
*   The *Sāsanavaṃsa* (1861 Burma) chronicles the history of the doctrine and its authors, particularly in Ceylon and Burma.
*   The *Sāsanavaṃsadīpa* (1880) is a similar work in Pāli verse focusing on the history of Buddhism in Ceylon.
