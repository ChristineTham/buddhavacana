title: Johannes Bronkhorst - Greater Magadha
description: A scholarly examination of "Greater Magadha" as a distinct cultural sphere in early India, separate from the Vedic-Brahmanical tradition. The text argues that key concepts like rebirth and karmic retribution originated in this region, which gave rise to Buddhism, Jainism, and Ājīvikism, and were only later absorbed by Brahmanism. It also offers a chronological re-evaluation of late-Vedic literature.

# INTRODUCTION - THE SEPARATE CULTURE OF GREATER MAGADHA

* **Definition of Āryāvarta**: Around 150 BCE, Patañjali defined the "land of the Āryas" as the region west of the confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā rivers; the east was considered foreign territory.
* **Shift in Perception**: By the time of the *Mānava Dharma Śāstra* (2nd-3rd century CE), the definition of Āryāvarta had expanded to include the area from sea to sea, indicating the eastward spread and acceptance of Brahmanism over time.
* **Political Context**: The region east of the Gaṅgā-Yamunā confluence (Greater Magadha) was the seat of the Mauryan empire and was ruled by kings (Nandas, Mauryas) who patronized non-Brahmanical movements like Jainism, Ājīvikism, and Buddhism.
* **Cultural Distinctness**: This area, termed "Greater Magadha," possessed a culture distinct from Vedic society, characterized by the second urbanization of South Asia and the rise of ascetic religious movements.
* **Vedic View of Magadha**: Early Brahmanical texts (e.g., *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*) viewed the easterners as "demonic" (*asura*), criticizing their round funerary mounds and barbarous speech.

# PART I - CULTURAL FEATURES OF GREATER MAGADHA

## INTRODUCTION

* **Sources**: Information is derived primarily from Buddhist and Jaina texts, and secondarily from archaeological evidence (Northern Black Polished ware) and Brahmanical texts.

## CHAPTER I.1 - THE FUNDAMENTAL SPIRITUAL IDEOLOGY

* **Core Belief**: The culture of Greater Magadha was defined by a belief in rebirth and karmic retribution, distinct from Vedic beliefs.
* **Nature of Karma**: Originally, *all* deeds (not just intentions) were believed to cause retribution, leading to the conclusion that activity itself must stop to end rebirth.

### *Early Jainism*

* **Goal**: Cessation of activity to prevent new karma and the destruction of old karma through asceticism.
* **Method**: Radical motionlessness and voluntary starvation to death (*sallekhanā*) were the ultimate practices to ensure no further karmic binding.

### *Knowledge of the self*

* **Concept**: Belief in a self (*ātman*) that is by nature inactive and distinct from the body and mind.
* **Function**: Realizing this separation meant the true self was not touched by actions, offering a way to escape karmic consequences without physical immobilization.

### *The Bhagavadgītā*

* **Integration**: Combines Sāṃkhya (knowledge of the inactive self) with Yoga (disciplined action).
* **Solution**: Action is performed by the *guṇas* (nature), not the self; acting without attachment to fruits renders the action karmically neutral.

### *Ājīvikism*

* **Determinism**: Founded by Makkhali Gosāla; central doctrine was *Niyati* (fate/destiny).
* **Karma View**: Asceticism cannot destroy past karma; one must pass through a fixed number of births (8,400,000 great kalpas) before liberation occurs naturally.
* **Practice**: Despite determinism, they practiced severe asceticism, likely believing it was their destiny to do so at the end of their cosmic journey.

### *Buddhism*

* **Innovation**: Shifted the focus from action itself to the *intention* (desire/thirst) behind the action.
* **Liberation**: Achieved through a psychological process of eliminating desire, rather than physical immobility.

### *Conclusions*

* **Shared Ideology**: With the exception of Buddhism (which modified the problem), all Greater Magadha movements shared the conviction that activity leads to rebirth and must be stopped or disowned.

## CHAPTER I.2 - OTHER FEATURES

### *Funerary practices*

* **Round Mounds**: The *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* contrasts the square burial mounds of the "godly" (Vedic) with the round mounds (*stūpas*) of the "demonic" easterners.

### *Medicine*

* **Two Traditions**: A distinction existed between Vedic medicine (magico-religious, charms/spells) and Magadhan medicine (empirico-rational, observation-based).
* **Greek Evidence**: Megasthenes and Strabo distinguish between Brahmanical healers (using spells) and Śramaṇic healers (using diet and medicines).

### *Kapila*

* **Dual Status**: In Brahmanical texts (e.g., *Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra*), Kapila is sometimes called an Asura (demon) and son of Prahlāda, indicating his non-Vedic origin.
* **Sāṃkhya**: He is the traditional founder of Sāṃkhya, a philosophy rooted in the Greater Magadha concept of knowledge of the self.

### *Cyclic time*

* **Non-Vedic Origin**: The concept of cyclic time (Kalpas, Yugas), absent in early Vedic texts, was present in Buddhism, Jainism, and Ājīvikism, suggesting it originated in Greater Magadha.

## CHAPTER I.3 - CONCLUSIONS TO PART I

* **Synthesis**: Greater Magadha possessed a coherent cultural package (rebirth, karma, cyclic time, empirico-rational medicine, sepulchral mounds) that existed alongside and distinct from Vedic culture before influencing it.

# PART II - BRAHMANISM VIS-Ā-VIS REBIRTH AND KARMIC RETRIBUTION

## INTRODUCTION

* **Impact**: The doctrine of rebirth and karma was the most influential export from Greater Magadha, gradually infiltrating Brahmanical thought with varying degrees of acceptance.

## PART IIA - REBIRTH AND KARMIC RETRIBUTION HESITANTLY ACCEPTED

### CHAPTER IIA.1 - A DHARMA SŪTRA

#### *Vedic asceticism*

* **Characteristics**: Vedic asceticism was linked to sacrifice and the householder stage (e.g., *śālīna*, *yāyāvara*), emphasizing ritual purity and austerity rather than cessation of activity.

#### *The Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra*

* **Classification**: Distinguishes between Vedic householder ascetics and non-Vedic ascetics (*parivrāja*, *vānaprastha*).
* **Critique**: The text prefers the householder stage and is critical of the non-Vedic forms that seek liberation or practice extreme fasting, labeling them opposed to scriptures.

#### *Confirmation in Greek sources*

* **Megasthenes**: Corroborates the distinction by classifying philosophers into *Brachmanes* (Brahmins) and *Sarmanes* (Śramaṇas), noting different practices and lifestyles for each.

### CHAPTER IIA.2 - A PORTION FROM THE MAHĀBHĀRATA

#### *The chronological position of the Mahābhārata*

* **Dating**: The epic's core likely formed in the post-Mauryan/Śuṅga period (c. 2nd century BCE), serving as a Brahmanical response to non-Vedic influences.

#### *The Rājadharmaparvan*

* **Debate**: Contains dialogues (e.g., Yudhiṣṭhira’s desire to renounce) reflecting the tension between the Vedic duty of action (*pravṛtti*) and the Magadhan ideal of renunciation (*nivṛtti*).
* **Integration**: Shows the gradual adoption of karma and liberation theories into the Brahmanical worldview, often attributing them to "Great Scholars" (*kavi*) rather than the Veda.

### CHAPTER IIA.3 - THE EARLY UPANIṢADS

#### *The first occurrences of the new doctrine*

* **Kshatriya Source**: In texts like the *Chāndogya* and *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣads*, Brahmins (e.g., Uddālaka) receive teachings on rebirth and karma from Kings (Kshatriyas), explicitly stating this knowledge did not previously belong to Brahmins.

#### *Rebirth and karmic retribution in relation to Vedic thought*

* **Hybridization**: The new doctrines are often grafted awkwardly onto Vedic ideas (e.g., the Five Fires knowledge), showing a lack of intrinsic connection in the earliest phases.

#### *The self in the early Upaniṣads*

* **Yājñavalkya**: Represents a pivotal figure who fully adopts the inactive Self doctrine, bridging the gap between Magadhan spirituality and Vedic tradition.

## PART IIB - REBIRTH AND KARMIC RETRIBUTION IGNORED OR REJECTED

### CHAPTER IIB.1 - Rebirth and karmic retribution ignored

* **Traditionalists**: Conservative Vedic texts (Gṛhya Sūtras, Śrauta Sūtras, early Mīmāṃsā) continued to focus on ritual and heaven, ignoring the new soteriology of liberation and rebirth for centuries.

### CHAPTER IIB.2 - Rebirth and karmic retribution rejected

#### *Criticism of rebirth and karmic retribution in anonymous literature*

* **Skepticism**: Traces of opposition to the rebirth doctrine are found in texts like the *Ayodhyākāṇḍa* of the Rāmāyaṇa (Jābāli’s advice) and Buddhist references to "nihilists" (*natthikavāda*).

#### *The Cārvākas*

* **Materialism**: The Cārvākas (or Lokāyatas) explicitly rejected inference, the afterlife, and the soul, identifying the self with the body. They represent a radical Brahmanical reaction against the new Magadhan ideologies.

## PART IIC - URBAN BRAHMINS

* **Adaptation**: Brahmins in urban centers (Pāṭaliputra etc.) adapted to court life, composing texts like the *Arthaśāstra* and *Kāmasūtra*.
* **Values**: These texts often pay lip service to liberation (*mokṣa*) but focus primarily on worldly goals (*artha*, *kāma*, *dharma*) and maintaining the social order (*varṇāśramadharma*).

# PART III - CHRONOLOGY

### CHAPTER III.1 - Linguistic considerations

* **Pāṇini**: The language described by Pāṇini helps date late-Vedic texts. Texts with grammatical forms violating Pāṇini’s rules (without being cited as Vedic exceptions) may be contemporaneous or later, existing in a separate linguistic sphere.

### CHAPTER III.2 - The Vedic texts known to the early Sanskrit grammarians

* **Pāṇini's Scope**: Pāṇini knew many Vedic texts (Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas) but likely not the *entire* corpus as it stands today. Some Upaniṣads and Sūtras may have been composed or finalized after him.

### CHAPTER III.3 - The Vedic texts known to the early Buddhists

* **Limited Knowledge**: The early Buddhist canon shows awareness of the Three Vedas but lacks specific knowledge of the Upaniṣads or the concept of *Brahman* as a neuter absolute, suggesting these were not yet dominant in the region.
* **Satire**: Buddhist critiques (e.g., birth from Brahmā’s mouth) satirize general myths rather than specific late-Vedic philosophical texts.

### CHAPTER III.4 - Some indications in late-Vedic literature

* **Chronology**: Evidence suggests the *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* and early Upaniṣads (Bṛhadāraṇyaka) underwent final redaction relatively late, possibly overlapping with the rise of Magadhan movements.

### CHAPTER III.5 - Urban versus rural culture

* **Cultural Divide**: Early Buddhist literature depicts a thriving urban culture, while late-Vedic literature reflects a rural, anti-urban village culture. This supports the thesis of two distinct cultural spheres co-existing.

# PART IV - CONCLUSION

* **Discworld meets Roundworld**: The interaction between the "Roundworld" of the Vedic Aryans (western, rural, ritualistic) and the "Discworld" of Greater Magadha (eastern, urban, spiritual/ascetic) resulted in the synthesis known as classical Hinduism.

# PART V - APPENDICES

* **Appendix I**: Argues that Vedānta philosophy is not as ancient as often claimed and was originally distinct from Mīmāṃsā.
* **Appendix II**: Discusses a "Cārvāka" (Pañcaśikha) in the Mahābhārata who denies the afterlife.
* **Appendix VI**: Analyzes Buddhist sermons on Brahmins, suggesting some are late compositions.
# PART V - APPENDICES

* **Appendix I**: Argues *Vedānta* (Uttara-Mīmāṃsā) is a late system that attached itself to the older Ritual Mīmāṃsā to legitimize independent speculations about *Brahma*.
* **Appendix II**: Identifies Pañcaśikha in the *Mahābhārata* as representing a "Cārvāka" position (denying rebirth), which is subsequently critiqued.
* **Appendix III-V**: Detailed grammatical discussions (Pāṇini, Patañjali) supporting the late fixation of Vedic texts.
* **Appendix VI**: Suggests Buddhist sermons mentioning Greeks (e.g., *Assalāyana Sutta*) are late compositions.
* **Appendix VII**: Delineates "Greater Gandhāra" as a distinct cultural zone and the home of Pāṇini.
* **Appendix VIII**: Discusses Cārvākas in the *Śābarabhāṣya* as orthodox Vedic traditionalists opposing the new doctrine of karma.
