:::

*   Theravāda Buddhism denies a permanent self (*attā*), raising the question of what transmigrates. The Buddha refuted the idea that it is consciousness (*viññāṇa*), stating that consciousness arises from conditions as part of the twelve-fold chain of dependant origination (*paṭicca-samuppāda*).
*   The *paṭicca-samuppāda* chain traces the cause of suffering (old age and death) back through links like birth, existence, craving, and ultimately to ignorance (*avijjā*). Destroying ignorance with knowledge (*vijjā*) breaks the chain, leading to release (*nibbāna*) from the cycle of rebirth (*saṃsāra*).
*   Accounts of the Buddha’s awakening (*bodhi*) vary. The shortest version focuses on the attainment of *nibbāna* without detailing the method. The *Mahāsaccakasutta* adds that the Buddha progressed through four meditative states (*jhānas*) and gained three knowledges: of his past lives, of the karma of others, and of the destruction of the defilements (*āsavas*).
*   The Buddha's first teaching was on the Four Noble Truths about misery (*dukkha*), with the fourth truth being the Eight-Fold Path to end misery. This path is presented as a way to *nibbāna* but differs from the method of *jhānas* and destruction of *āsavas* described in the accounts of his own awakening.
*   The destruction of the *āsavas* (lust, becoming, ignorance) is a key concept, and "one whose *āsavas* are destroyed" (*khīnāsava*) is a common term for an enlightened being (*arahat*). The original meaning of *āsava* may have been closer to "karmic formations" (*sañkhāras*), with the emphasis later shifting to the concept of *dukkha*.
*   There are apparent contradictions in the texts, such as the Buddha learning advanced meditative states (*arūpa-jhānas*) from teachers before his awakening, yet later recalling the first basic *jhāna* from his boyhood as the path forward. This suggests the different sets of *jhānas* were likely originally separate meditative systems.
*   A ninth meditative state, the "cessation of feelings and perceptions" (*saññāvedayitanirodha*), is also mentioned as a way to destroy the *āsavas*. However, the account of the Buddha's death shows him entering this state but then returning to the fourth *jhāna* to attain final *nibbāna*, indicating they are not identical.
*   *Nibbāna* is described in negative terms as the opposite of worldly existence: it is blissful, unmoving, undying, unborn, and uncompounded (*asańkhata*).
*   There are two types of *nibbāna*: one achieved during life with the physical body remaining (*sa-upādisesā*), and the final one at death which ends rebirth (*anupādisesā*).
*   Since Buddhism denies a permanent soul and defines an individual as a temporary collection of five aggregates (*khandhas*), the attainment of *nibbāna* involves the cessation of these compounded elements, leaving only the uncompounded. The resulting state cannot be described, similar to a fire that has gone out but is not annihilated.
