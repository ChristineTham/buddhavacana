*   Synchronic etymologising, the act of clarifying a word's meaning by linking it to similar-sounding words, is a universal phenomenon found across cultures and in children.
*   This tendency plays a crucial role in the process of language acquisition.

## 1 Introduction

*   Synchronic etymologising clarifies a word's meaning through resemblance to other words (e.g., the god Rudra's name is linked to the verb *rud-*, 'to cry').
*   This differs from historical (diachronic) etymology, which traces a word's origin through time (e.g., Hindi *maim* from Sanskrit *mayā*).
*   While common in children and pre-modern cultures, modern linguists do not consider it a valid method for determining meaning.

## 2 Examples of Synchronic Etymologising in Different Cultures

*   The practice is widespread in pre-modern societies.
*   Examples include Sumerian myths (deity Nin**ka**si curing mouth [*ka*] pain), ancient Egypt (*weben*/*ben* wordplay), the Hebrew Bible (Adam from *adama*, 'earth'), Greek myths (Odysseus from *odussomai*, 'I am angry'), medieval Europe (*amor* as *a-mor*, 'without death'), and Trobriand Islands magic.
*   The tendency can also be found in some modern nationalistic writings.

## 3 Attempts to Systematise

*   Plato's *Cratylus* is the classical Greek text on the topic, exploring whether words have a natural connection to their meaning.
*   In the dialogue, Socrates investigates the idea that primary names are formed from letters that imitate the nature of things (e.g., the sound *rho* expressing activity).
*   Socrates ultimately finds this theory insufficient, concluding that convention must also play a role in establishing the correctness of names.
*   Yāska's *Nirukta* is the classical Indian text, which aimed to systematise the etymologies found in the Vedic Brāhmaṇas.
*   The *Nirukta* establishes rules for etymologising, prioritising the word's meaning over phonetic similarity.

## 4 Minimal Meaning Bearers

*   Unlike Plato's *Cratylus*, Yāska's *Nirukta* does not propose that individual sounds have inherent meanings.
*   The Indian grammarian Patañjali also argued against sounds having individual meanings.
*   However, a separate mystical tradition in Indian religious literature (Vedic texts, Upaniṣads) did assign specific meanings to syllables and sounds (e.g., analysing the syllables of *hṛ-da-yam*, 'heart').
*   This culminated in Tantric texts, which attribute specific metaphysical significance to every sound of the Sanskrit alphabet, especially in meaningless seed-mantras (*bīja-mantras*).

## 5 Why Synchronic Etymologising?

*   The tendency to etymologise arises from the fundamental process of language acquisition, which involves 'chunking' speech into meaningful units (phonemes, syllables, words).
*   Children learn language by analysing utterances to identify these chunks, and this analytical tendency continues below the level of words and morphemes.
*   This suggests that our mental concepts are not pre-existing but are formed by segmenting the linguistic utterances we hear.
*   The innate human tendency to segment language, even beyond what is objectively meaningful, supports theories that early protolanguage may have been holistic (holophrastic).
