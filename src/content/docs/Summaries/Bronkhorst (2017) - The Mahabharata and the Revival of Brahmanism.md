*   Brahmanism was initially a geographically limited priestly culture in the Gangetic plain, where brahmins were supported by local rulers for their sacrificial traditions.
*   The rise of the Nanda and Maurya empires from Magadha, a region outside the Brahmanical heartland, threatened this system as these rulers had no interest in brahminical sacrifices.
*   In response, Brahmanism transformed from a priestly religion into a socio-political ideology that could spread across India and Southeast Asia, creating a "Sanskrit cosmopolis."
*   The *Mahābhārata* was a key instrument in this project, designed to promote the new Brahmanical worldview to a wider audience, including non-brahmins.
*   To compete with popular ascetic movements from "Greater Magadha" (like Buddhism and Jainism), Brahmanism introduced the non-Vedic concept of the *āśrama* (hermitage).
*   *Āśramas* depicted brahmins as ideal ascetics, living frugally and independently in forests, which helped them attract patronage from rulers and wealthy donors.
*   These literary *āśramas* were likely the ideological counterpart to *agrahāras*—actual gifts of land or villages to brahmins. By not acknowledging them as gifts, brahmins maintained a public image of self-sufficiency and inherent authority.
*   Brahmanism also incorporated a competing ascetic model from Greater Magadha—the begging mendicant seeking liberation (*mokṣa*). The *Mahābhārata* presents both the self-sufficient forest-dweller and the begging mendicant, which later texts would organize into sequential stages of life.
