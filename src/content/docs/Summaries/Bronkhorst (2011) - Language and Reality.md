### PREFACE TO THE FRENCH EDITION

*   The book is based on a series of lectures delivered in Paris in May 1997.
*   Its main subject is the "correspondence principle," exploring the relationship between language and reality in classical Indian thought.
*   The study is presented as an exploratory contribution, focusing on a representative but not exhaustive selection of Indian philosophical cases.

## CHAPTER ONE - INTRODUCTION: WORDS AND THINGS

### 1. Aim of the Lectures

*   The lectures focus on the "correspondence principle" in classical Indian thought: the conviction that words in a sentence correspond exactly to the things in the situation described.
*   This principle was prominent in the first half of the first millennium CE and influenced various philosophical schools, including Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
*   The goal is to identify this principle as a unifying question behind the diverse positions of different schools of thought.

### 2. Early Brahmanical Literature

*   Early Brahmanical texts suggest a close connection between words and things, often describing an original, undivided state of "name and form."
*   This belief underpins the efficacy of magical formulas and the widespread use of etymologies in Vedic literature to reveal the essence of things.
*   Myths explain this connection by stating that ancient sages (*ṛṣis*) with superior knowledge named things, or that the world was created from the words of the Veda.
*   Pāṇini's grammar rule of *ekaśeṣa* (using one plural word for multiple objects instead of repeating the word) implies a fundamental acceptance of a one-to-one correspondence between a word and an object.

### 3. Pāṇini's Grammar

*   Pāṇini's grammar is synthetic, combining meaning-bearing elements (roots, suffixes) to form words, in contrast to the later, analytical approach of Patañjali, for whom whole words are the primary meaning-bearers.
*   The term for grammar, *vyākaraṇa*, is interpreted not as "analysis" or "formation," but as the "separation" or "differentiation" of linguistic elements from the objects they denote.
*   This interpretation is based on Vedic passages where the verb *vyākṛ-* describes the primordial separation of name and form, reinforcing the idea of a close link between language and reality.

### 4. A Passage from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad

*   A passage where Śvetaketu's father teaches him presents a contrasting view within Brahmanical thought.
*   It states that different objects made of a single substance (e.g., clay pots from clay) are mere modifications (*vikāra*) and names (*nāmadheya*), while the underlying substance is the only reality.
*   This position, where speech can conceal a deeper reality, is noted for its similarity to later Buddhist ideas.

### 5. The Structures of Languages

*   Thinkers in ancient India, including Buddhists and grammarians, generally believed that different languages differed only in vocabulary (word forms), not in their fundamental structure.
*   Sanskrit was often considered the correct and universal language, with other languages viewed as its corruptions.
*   This conviction allowed conclusions drawn from the structure of Sanskrit to be seen as universally applicable.

### 6. The Buddhist Contribution

*   Scholastic Buddhism developed an ontology based on lists of ultimate, irreducible elements called *dharmas*.
*   According to this view, only the *dharmas* truly exist; composite, macroscopic objects of experience (like persons or chariots) are not real entities.
*   These composite objects are considered "existent by designation" (*prajñaptisat*), meaning they are merely names or concepts, as illustrated by the chariot analogy in the *Milindapañha*.

### 7. Vaiśeṣika and Language

*   The Vaiśeṣika system is a Brahmanical ontology that, like scholastic Buddhism, provides an exhaustive enumeration of all that exists.
*   Unlike Buddhism, Vaiśeṣika affirms the reality of the phenomenal world.
*   Its core categories—substance (*dravya*), quality (*guṇa*), and motion (*karman*)—correspond to the primary word types in Sanskrit: nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
*   This suggests that the Vaiśeṣika system uses the structure of language as a guide to map the structure of reality.

### 8. Verbal Knowledge

*   Vaiśeṣika texts treat language as a source of knowledge, referring to "verbal knowledge" as a form of inference.
*   The *Nyāya Sūtra* and its commentary critique an opponent (likely an early Vaiśeṣika thinker) for holding that language itself, independent of a trustworthy speaker, can be a valid means of knowledge.
*   This debate suggests that some Vaiśeṣikas explicitly believed that language could be used directly to gain knowledge about the world's ontological structure.

## CHAPTER TWO - THE CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE

*   The chapter discusses the "correspondence principle," an intuition shared by many classical Indian thinkers.
*   This principle holds that the elements of a situation described by a sentence must correspond one-to-one with the words of that sentence and must coexist simultaneously.

### 1. The Contradictions of Nāgārjuna

*   The Buddhist thinker Nāgārjuna used the correspondence principle to reveal contradictions in the phenomenal world.
*   For a sentence like "the pot arises," the principle requires a pot to exist to be the agent of the action "arises."
*   However, if the pot already exists, it has no need to arise, creating a contradiction.
*   Nāgārjuna used such arguments to challenge those who affirmed the reality of the phenomenal world.

### 2. The Reactions of Other Thinkers

*   Indian thinkers reacted to the challenge posed by Nāgārjuna and the correspondence principle in two main ways.
*   The first solution was to maintain that the effect (e.g., the pot) already existed in some form before its arising.
*   The second solution was to reject or adapt the correspondence principle itself.

### 3. Sarvāstivāda

*   This Buddhist school's core doctrine provided a ready-made solution to the problem of arising.
*   Their name means "all things exist," which refers to their belief that dharmas exist in the past, present, and future.
*   Therefore, an object can arise because it already exists in its future state.
*   The text suggests this school was aware of these problems even before Nāgārjuna.

### 4. Sāmkhya

*   This school developed the doctrine of *satkāryavāda*, which states that the effect pre-exists in its cause.
*   This doctrine directly answers the problem of arising by asserting that the object to be created is already present.
*   One of their arguments was that for a cause to be a cause, its effect must exist simultaneously with it.
*   The related doctrine of *sarvasarvātmakatvavāda* (everything is made of everything) addressed the problem of disappearance.

### 5. The Āgamaśāstra of Gauḍapāda

*   This early Vedānta text uses arguments similar to Nāgārjuna's.
*   It concludes that since something that exists cannot arise (as it's already there) and something that doesn't exist cannot arise (as it's not there), there is no arising in ultimate truth.

### 6. Śaṅkara

*   In his commentary on the Āgamaśāstra, Śaṅkara explains and seems to accept the arguments for non-arising.
*   However, in his other major works, Śaṅkara consistently supports *satkāryavāda*, the view that the effect pre-exists.
*   He argues that an action like "arising" requires an agent; therefore, in "the pot arises," the pot must exist to be the agent of its own arising.

### 7. Kashmiri Śaivism

*   This school presents a variant of *satkāryavāda*.
*   The effect exists before it arises, not in its physical cause (like a seed), but within the creative consciousness of God.
*   God is the true agent of all actions, including "arising" and "existing."

### 8. Jainism

*   The story of the heretic Jamāli highlights the problem of the coexistence of present and past (e.g., "what is being made has been made").
*   The Jaina solution, articulated by Jinabhadra, is that an object is "in the process of being made" only in the final moment of its creation, the very moment it *has been* made.
*   This preserves the correspondence principle by collapsing the duration of the action into a single instant.
*   Jaina philosophy also uses different "points of view" (*naya*) to state that an object can be seen as eternal from the perspective of substance, while arising from the perspective of its modifications.

### 9. Early VaiśeṣiKa

*   This school officially held that the effect does not pre-exist (*asatkāryavāda*).
*   However, to solve the problem of arising, early texts suggest they posited a temporary, obscure form of existence for the effect during the period of its production.
*   An object was said to have an "essence" (*astitva*) even before it was connected with the universal "existence" (*sattā*).

### 10. Critiques of the Existence of a Thing before Its Arising

*   Some thinkers critiqued the *satkāryavāda* position.
*   An opponent in Śaṅkara's work argues that Nāgārjuna's reasoning is a fallacy based only on words, ignoring the real-world connection between a seed and a sprout.
*   The Jaina thinker Mallavādin argues against the Sāṃkhya view by pointing out that a cause does not always produce its effect, thus breaking the necessary link of simultaneous existence.

### 11. Nyāya

*   The Nyāya school proposed a "semantic" solution to the problem.
*   They argued that words do not refer only to individuals but also to universals (*jāti*).
*   In "the pot arises," the word "pot" refers to the eternal universal "pot-ness," which is always present, thus satisfying the correspondence principle without the individual pot having to pre-exist.
*   Other solutions mentioned in their texts include a word referring to its cause (e.g., "mat" referring to the grass) or to past and future objects.

### 12. Mīmāṃsā

*   This school also adopted a semantic solution, arguing that words refer to forms (*ākṛti*) or universals.
*   In the Vedic injunction "One should pile a falcon-pile," the word "falcon" must refer to the eternal form of a falcon, not an individual bird, because an individual cannot be the object of the action of piling bricks.

### 13. The Abhidharmakośa Bhāṣya of Vasubandhu

*   Vasubandhu, representing the Sautrāntika view, rejects the Sarvāstivāda doctrine that past and future exist.
*   He proposes that present words can refer to past and future objects.
*   He also dissolves the problem by rejecting the distinction between an agent and its action for verbs like "arises," arguing that the dharma and its arising are not two separate entities.

### 14. The Abhidharmasamuccaya of Asaṅga and Its Bhāṣya

*   This Yogācāra text treats the problem of arising as a "profundity" or mystery.
*   It states that while effects arise from conditions, they are not "made" by them, meaning the conditions are not agents.
*   This appears to tolerate a contradiction with the correspondence principle, suggesting it is not always valid.

### 15. Bhartṛhari

*   The grammarian-philosopher Bhartṛhari was acutely aware of the problem and proposed several solutions.
*   He argued that the referent of a word could be an eternal universal (*jāti*), an immutable substance (*dravya*), a "metaphorical existence" applicable to past and future things, or a mental reality (*buddhi*).
*   All these solutions preserve the correspondence principle by providing an existing referent for words in problematic sentences.

### 16. The Problem of Negation

*   The correspondence principle creates a problem for negative statements, as a word must refer to something for the negation to be meaningful.
*   This challenge likely led later Vaiśeṣika to add "absence" (*abhāva*) as a seventh real category.
*   The Naiyāyika Uddyotakara argued that existential negation (e.g., "the soul does not exist") is self-contradictory because the word "soul" must refer to an existing object to be meaningful.

### 17. Dignāga and Verbal Knowledge

*   The Buddhist logician Dignāga offered a revolutionary solution by rejecting the correspondence principle.
*   His theory of *apoha* (exclusion) states that a word's meaning comes not from referring to a positive entity (like a universal) but from excluding everything that is not its object.
*   The object of a word is a conceptual construction, not a real entity, which severs the direct link between language and reality and dissolves Nāgārjuna's paradoxes.

### 18. The Bodhisattvabhūmi

*   This Yogācāra text also rejects a strict correspondence between words and things.
*   It argues that since a single object can be referred to by many different words, the object's nature cannot be identical to any one word.
*   This undermines the foundation of Nāgārjuna's arguments by denying the one-to-one link between language and reality.

### 19. Prajñākaragupta

*   This later Buddhist thinker uses sentences like "the sprout arises" in his arguments, but not to engage with the correspondence principle.
*   His use of these examples for different purposes suggests that by his time, the paradoxes that troubled earlier thinkers were no longer a central philosophical concern.

### 20. Indian Thinkers and the Correspondence Principle

*   The correspondence principle was likely an unstated, shared intuition rather than an explicit doctrine.
*   Thinkers were clearly aware of its implications, as shown by their complex arguments, but they rarely discussed the principle itself because its validity seemed obvious to them.
*   The study of such implicit assumptions is crucial to understanding the development of classical Indian thought.

# APPENDIX - THE MAHĀPRAJĀĀPĀRAMITĀŚĀSTRA AND THE SĀṂKHYA TANMĀTRAS

*   A major change occurred in Sāṃkhya doctrine, likely around the 5th century CE, where the five qualities were replaced by the five *tanmātras* in the list of fundamental *tattvas*.
*   In the earlier Sāṃkhya, qualities were derived from the elements and were the final evolutes; in the later version, *tanmātras* precede the elements.
*   The *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra* (early 5th century CE) describes an evolutionary sequence where the five *tanmātras* arise from *ahaṃkāra* and in turn produce the five great elements (*mahābhūtas*).
*   In this text, elements are formed by a combination of multiple *tanmātras*; for example, earth is produced jointly by all five *tanmātras* (sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell).
*   This contrasts with the view in the *Yuktidīpikā*, where each element arises from a single, specific *tanmātra* which itself possesses a cumulative number of qualities (e.g., earth arises from the single 'smell' *tanmātra* which has five qualities).
*   The description in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra* suggests that *tanmātras* were conceived as atomic constituents (*aṇu*) that combine to form the elements, an interpretation supported by Kumārajīva's Chinese translation.
*   The *Yoga Bhāṣya* and Utpaladeva's work also provide evidence for an atomic interpretation of *tanmātras*, viewing them as the subtle building blocks of the gross elements.
*   The introduction of *tanmātras* may have been a way to make the Sāṃkhya view of matter (as constituted by qualities) more substance-like and compatible with the doctrine of *satkāryavāda* (the effect pre-exists in the cause).
*   Vyomaśiva's *Vyomavatī* presents a hybrid Sāṃkhya-Vaiśeṣika view where the *śabdatanmātra* (sound-tanmātra) is treated as a type of atom that can constitute a molecule (*dvyaṇuka*).
*   However, classical Sāṃkhya, as represented by the *Yuktidīpikā*, ultimately rejected the atomic nature of *tanmātras*.
*   The *Yuktidīpikā* argues that *tanmātras* cannot be atoms because a cause (*prakṛti*) must be larger than its effect (*vikṛti*). Therefore, the *tanmātras* must be larger than the macroscopic elements they produce.
