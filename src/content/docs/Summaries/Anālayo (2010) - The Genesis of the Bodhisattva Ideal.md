#### About this Publication

*   This book by Bhikkhu Anālayo investigates the origins of the bodhisattva ideal using early discourses from Pāli and Chinese sources.
*   Anālayo argues that early sources do not present compassionate concern for others as the primary motivation for the Buddha's quest for awakening.
*   He shows that the single reference to Maitreya in the Pāli canon is likely a later addition.
*   The book examines a Madhyamāgama discourse, possibly the first of its kind, where Śākyamuni Buddha predicts the future buddhahood of Maitreya.
*   Anālayo outlines a gradual genesis of the bodhisattva ideal, documenting the evolution of the concept, the emergence of the vow, and the idea of receiving a prediction from a former buddha.

# Introduction

*   The author investigates the origins of the bodhisattva concept by examining early Buddhist discourses.
*   The study is divided into three chapters: the bodhisattva conception in early discourses, the meeting between Gautama and Buddha Kāśyapa in relation to the bodhisattva vow, and the future Buddha Maitreya in relation to predictions of success.
*   The primary sources are the discourses in the four main Pāli Nikāyas and their counterparts in the Chinese Āgamas (Dīrgha-āgama, Madhyama-āgama, Saṃyukta-āgama).
*   The Ekottarika-āgama and the Mahāvastu are also used, but are noted to contain a mixture of early and later material.
*   The research is based on Pāli, Chinese (Taishō), and Tibetan (Derge and Peking) editions of the texts.

### Acknowledgement

*   This publication combines several articles that were originally intended for separate publication.
*   The author thanks several scholars for their valuable suggestions and assistance.
*   The author takes sole responsibility for any errors or omissions.
*   A limitation of the research is the inability to consult works published in Japanese.

# 1 Gautama as a Bodhisattva

*   This chapter traces the development of the term "bodhisattva" from its use for the unawakened Gautama seeking enlightenment to the notion of a being destined to become a Buddha.
*   It examines four topics: Gautama's progress to awakening, his motivation, his marvellous qualities, and the lineage of former Buddhas.

## 1.1 Gautama's Progress to Awakening

*   In Pāli discourses, the Buddha uses the term "bodhisattva" (bodhisatta) to refer to himself before his awakening.
*   This term is often absent in parallel texts from other traditions, which tend to use more honorific titles even for the pre-awakening period.
*   The bodhisattva's progress involved overcoming unwholesome mental states like fear and sensuality, developing mental tranquillity, and growing insight.
*   This path is similar to that of an arhat, suggesting the term initially meant an individual "in search of awakening".

## 1.2 Gautama's Motivation

*   The bodhisattva's motivation to seek awakening was to find a solution for himself being subject to old age and death.
*   Early texts indicate his quest was for personal liberation, with no mention of a concern for others.
*   After his awakening, the Buddha was initially reluctant to teach, viewing it as potentially fatiguing and vexing, and only agreed after an intervention by the god Brahmā.
*   In early discourses, compassion and teaching activity are presented as a result of awakening, not the motivation for it, and were qualities also expected of arhats.

## 1.3 Gautama's Marvellous Qualities

*   The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* and its parallel describe marvellous qualities of the bodhisattva, focusing on his conception and birth.
*   These marvels include being mindful in Tuṣita heaven, entering his mother's womb with clear comprehension, being born without impurities, and taking seven steps at birth.
*   The Pāli version adds a proclamation made by the infant bodhisattva: "I am supreme in the world... this is my last birth", which is absent in the Chinese parallel and likely a later addition.
*   This proclamation shifts a realization originally attained at awakening to the moment of birth, transforming the bodhisattva from a seeker into a being already accomplished and destined for Buddhahood.
*   The purpose of these stories was likely to inspire devotion and provide an emotional connection to the Buddha after his death.

## 1.4 The Lineage of Former Buddhas

*   The *Mahāpadāna-sutta* applies the same marvellous qualities of the bodhisattva Gautama to the six previous Buddhas.
*   This establishes these marvels as a generic norm for all beings who are about to become Buddhas, not just a unique feature of Gautama.
*   The lineage of former Buddhas served to authenticate the Buddha's message by providing him with a spiritual ancestry.
*   By making superiority a birthright for all bodhisattvas in their final life, this development helps transform the bodhisattva concept from a description of an individual into an ideal that can be emulated.

## Summary

*   The concept of the bodhisattva developed from a being seeking his own liberation to a being destined for awakening from the moment of birth.
*   Gautama's motivation was initially personal, with compassionate concern for others arising only as a consequence of his awakening.
*   After the Buddha's death, the need for devotion led to the creation of stories about his marvellous qualities.
*   A key development was the story of the infant bodhisattva proclaiming his final birth, which shifted the knowledge of final liberation from the moment of awakening to the moment of birth.
*   Applying these marvels to a lineage of past Buddhas made them a generic norm, laying the foundation for the bodhisattva concept to evolve into an ideal to be emulated.

# 2 Meeting the Previous Buddha

*   This chapter focuses on the bodhisattva's vow, using the story of Gautama's meeting with the previous Buddha, Kāśyapa.
*   It examines the jātaka genre, the specific discourses of the meeting, and the nature of the tale as a jātaka, before discussing the vow itself.

## 2.1 The Jātaka Genre

*   The jātaka genre, which recounts the Buddha's past lives, grew in importance as the bodhisattva ideal developed.
*   Many jātaka tales are ancient Indian fables that were adapted by identifying a protagonist with the Buddha in a former life.
*   Comparative analysis of different versions of tales from early discourses and the Vinaya shows that many were originally parables or similes.
*   These tales were later transformed into jātakas, a process indicated by variations across texts regarding which character was the bodhisattva, or whether the story was a jātaka at all.

## 2.2 Gautama Meets Kāśyapa

*   The Ghaṭikāra-sutta and its parallels tell the story of a potter who convinces his reluctant friend, a young Brahmin, to visit the Buddha Kāśyapa.
*   The Brahmin initially refuses, using derogatory language, but the potter physically compels him to go.
*   After hearing Kāśyapa's teaching, the Brahmin becomes a monk and is not mentioned again in the story.
*   The narrative's main focus is the potter's exemplary conduct as a lay disciple, contrasting him with the local king.

## 2.3 The Meeting with Kāśyapa as a Jātaka

*   All versions of the tale identify the young Brahmin as a past life of the Buddha Gautama, but this identification presents several problems.
*   The Brahmin's reluctance and disrespect towards a Buddha conflict with the developed bodhisattva ideal.
*   If Gautama had been a disciple of Kāśyapa, it would contradict his later claims of having no teacher and realizing something "unheard before."
*   Evidence, such as a conflicting identification in the Ekottarika-āgama and the story's absence from the Pāli Jātaka collection, suggests the tale may not have originally been a jātaka.

## 2.4 Gautama's Vow under Kāśyapa

*   The Madhyama-āgama's "Discourse on Marvellous Qualities" introduces the idea that the bodhisattva made his initial vow to seek Buddhahood while he was a monk under Buddha Kāśyapa.
*   This concept is likely a later addition, as it is absent from parallel texts and even from the Madhyama-āgama's own telling of the meeting story.
*   The vow provides an ingenious solution to the problem of why the bodhisattva made no recorded spiritual progress under Kāśyapa: he chose to pursue future Buddhahood instead of immediate liberation.
*   The text suggests a three-stage evolution of the story: from a simple didactic tale, to the site of the bodhisattva's initial vow, and finally to a reconfirmation of a vow made much earlier.

## Summary

*   The Ghaṭikāra-sutta and its parallels narrate how a potter convinces a reluctant young Brahmin (identified as the bodhisattva Gautama) to visit the Buddha Kāśyapa, after which the Brahmin becomes a monk.
*   The tale may have originally been a didactic story about the exemplary potter, as the bodhisattva's conduct is uninspiring.
*   The Madhyama-āgama introduces a solution: at that time, Gautama made the vow to pursue Buddhahood, explaining his lack of immediate attainment.
*   This introduces the resolve to become a Buddha, a key component of the bodhisattva ideal.

# 3 The Advent of the Next Buddha

*   The chapter focuses on the concept of a Buddha giving a prediction to a bodhisattva about their future success.
*   The primary text for this is the *Discourse on an Explanation about the Past* in the Madhyama-āgama, where a monk receives a prediction to become the future Buddha Maitreya.
*   The chapter will first examine an earlier reference to Maitreya in the *Discourse on the Wheel-turning King*.

## 3.1 Maitreya in the Discourse on the Wheel-turning King

*   Maitreya has been a significant figure in Buddhist history, serving as a source of inspiration, an object of worship in sculptures, and a protector.
*   Famous scholars like Buddhaghosa aspired to attain liberation under Maitreya, and Asaṅga is said to have received teachings from him.
*   The earliest textual reference to Maitreya is found in the *Discourse on the Wheel-turning King*, which exists in three versions: Dīgha-nikāya, Dīrgha-āgama, and Madhyama-āgama.
*   The discourse tells a story of a righteous king, followed by a period of moral decline and shortened lifespans, and then a gradual improvement culminating in a future golden age when Maitreya appears.

### a) The Dīgha-nikāya version

*   In a future time when human lifespan is 80,000 years, a wheel-turning king named Sañkha will arise.
*   A Buddha named Metteyya (Maitreya) will also appear, possessing the same qualities as the current Buddha, Gautama.
*   King Sańkha will eventually renounce his throne, become a disciple of Metteyya, and achieve liberation.
*   The discourse concludes by advising monks to be a refuge unto themselves by practising the four establishments of mindfulness.

### b) The Dirgha-āgama version

*   This version first describes the future Buddha Maitreya, who will have a community of disciples known as the "Sons of Maitri".
*   It then describes the wheel-turning king Śańkha, who will rule righteously.
*   The king will raise a great jewelled pillar, give it away as a gift, and then renounce the world to achieve liberation.
*   The discourse ends by advising monks to cultivate wholesome conduct.

### c) The Madhyama-āgama version

*   This version describes the future wheel-turning king Śańkha, who rules successfully by keeping to the traditions of his forefathers.
*   The discourse then directly advises monks to act similarly by keeping to their own "resort" (the four establishments of mindfulness).
*   This version makes no mention of the future Buddha Maitreya.

## 3.2 The Maitreya Episode in Comparative Perspective

*   A comparison of the three versions shows the Maitreya episode is placed differently in the Dīgha-nikāya and Dīrgha-āgama and is completely absent from the Madhyama-āgama version.
*   The author argues that the Maitreya episode was likely a later addition to the original discourse, with the Madhyama-āgama version representing the earlier form.
*   The idea of a precise, long-term prediction conflicts with the early Buddhist concept of dependent arising (conditioned but not predetermined).
*   The entire narration of the wheel-turning king is likely a parable or allegory, with the central teaching being that monks should keep to their proper resort (mindfulness practice).

## 3.3 Maitreya in the Discourse on an Explanation about the Past

*   This discourse from the Madhyama-āgama presents a more developed story of Maitreya.
*   It begins with a tale of Anuruddha's past life, after which the Buddha tells a tale of the future.
*   In the Buddha's tale, a monk named Maitreya hears about the future Buddha and aspires to become him.
*   The Buddha praises the monk's aspiration and gives him a prediction that he will indeed become the future Buddha Maitreya.
*   This marks a significant shift, where a current disciple of Gautama is identified as a bodhisattva who will become the next Buddha.
*   The author suggests a three-stage textual evolution: first, a tale with no Maitreya; second, a tale where Maitreya's advent is described; and third, a tale where a listener aspires to become Maitreya and receives a prediction.

## 3.4 The Prediction of Maitreya

*   The prediction given to the monk Maitreya emphasizes that he will become a Buddha with the exact same qualities as the present Buddha Gautama.
*   This message is heavily emphasized through repetition, occurring eight times in the narrative through description, aspiration, quotation, and the final prediction.
*   The primary purpose of the passage appears to be providing assurance and a sense of continuity for the faithful after the Buddha's death.
*   It fills the vacuum left by the Buddha's passing by providing a substitute: the future Buddha Maitreya and the present bodhisattva Maitreya dwelling in Tuṣita.
*   The concept of a Buddha giving a prediction to a bodhisattva may have arisen as a by-product of this need for reassurance.
*   Discourses in the Ekottarika-āgama complete the development by presenting Maitreya as a bodhisattva who can be emulated and who seeks instruction on the bodhisattva path.

## Summary

*   A comparative study suggests the earliest canonical reference to the future Buddha Maitreya was a later addition to the *Discourse on the Wheel-turning King*.
*   The *Discourse on an Explanation about the Past* from the Madhyama-āgama contains a more developed version where the Buddha Gautama gives a prediction to a monk, assuring his future success in becoming the Buddha Maitreya.
*   This introduction of a prediction given to an aspiring bodhisattva is a key element in the genesis of the bodhisattva ideal.

# Conclusion

*   The bodhisattva concept shifted from one in quest of awakening to a being inevitably destined for it, with the marvels at Gautama's birth becoming the norm for all bodhisattvas.
*   Key developments contributing to the bodhisattva ideal include the idea of taking a vow to become a Buddha and receiving a prediction from a previous Buddha.
*   The gradual exaltation (apotheosis) of the Buddha after his death was a central factor behind these developments.
*   Evidence suggests that renunciate bodhisattvas existed within Nikāya Buddhism, practicing based on the early discourses.
*   The bodhisattva ideal became a pan-Buddhist phenomenon, with the Mahāyāna later emerging from groups who exclusively devoted themselves to the Bodhisattvayāna, exalting it as the "Great Vehicle".
*   The precise origins of the ideal are difficult to determine due to the oral transmission of early textual records.
