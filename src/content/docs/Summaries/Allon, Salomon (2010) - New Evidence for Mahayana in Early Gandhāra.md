THIS ARTICLE is based on a lecture of the same title presented jointly by the authors at an international symposium entitled "The Mahāsāṃghika School, Mahāyāna, and Gandhāra: The Encounter of Buddhist Art Historians and Archaeologists and Buddhist Philologists" held at Soka University, Hachioji, Japan (29-30 November 2008), and a similar lecture by Richard Salomon at Otani University, Kyoto, Japan (1 December 2008).

## I. INTRODUCTION: NEW SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE EARLY MAHAYANA IN GANDHĀRA

*   This article focuses on new textual evidence from inscriptions and manuscripts for a Mahayana presence in Gandhāra during the first three centuries CE.
*   The evidence comes from several large collections of manuscripts from Pakistan and Afghanistan that have emerged since the 1990s, written in Gāndhārī and Sanskrit.
*   These discoveries are changing the understanding of early Buddhism in Greater Gandhāra.

## II. SURVEY OF NEW DOCUMENTS BEARING ON EARLY MAHAYANA IN GANDHĀRA

## II.a. Epigraphic and Manuscript Discoveries Bearing on Mahayana in Gandhāra, Published up to 2002

*   A 3rd-century CE Gāndhārī inscription from Xinjiang is the earliest epigraphic evidence of the word *mahāyāna*, describing a king as having "set out on the Mahayana path."
*   A Sanskrit manuscript fragment from Bamiyan refers to the 2nd-century CE Kuṣāna emperor Huviṣka as an adherent of the Mahayana.
*   An inscription from Mathurā (c. 153 CE), during Huviṣka's reign, records the establishment of an image of the Buddha Amitābha, an important Mahayana practice.
*   A controversial Gāndhārī inscription may refer to Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara, but the interpretation is disputed.
*   A manuscript fragment of the *Aṣtasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā* from Bamiyan, dated to the late 3rd century CE, was previously the oldest known Mahayana text in an Indian language.

## II.b. Recent Unpublished Discoveries of Mahayana Texts in Gāndhārī Manuscripts

*   Fragments of a Gāndhārī version of the *Bhadrakalpika-sūtra* were found among the Bamiyan manuscripts.
*   A small fragment of the unquestionably Mahayana *Sarvapunyasamuccayasamādhi-sūtra* was identified in the Schøyen collection.
*   A Gāndhārī fragment of the *Bodhisattvapitaka-sūtra* was found, predating a Sanskrit version also discovered at Bamiyan.
*   The Bajaur collection contains a long Gāndhārī manuscript of a sutra about the Buddha Akṣobhya, dated to the 1st-2nd centuries CE, supporting the theory that the Akṣobhya cult was prominent in early "Pure Land" Buddhism.
*   The "split" collection includes a Gāndhārī manuscript of the *Aṣtasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā*, radiocarbon dated to the late 1st or early 2nd century CE, making it the earliest dated Mahayana manuscript.
*   A fragmentary Gāndhārī scroll from the 1st or 2nd century CE contains a Mahayana sutra about the Buddha's encounter with Vimalakīrti's son, Sucitti.

## III. EARLY MAHAYANA IN GANDHĀRA: A NEW EVALUATION

### III.a. Mahayana in Gandhāran Manuscripts: A Shifting Picture

*   Initial manuscript discoveries (British Library, Senior collections) contained only mainstream, non-Mahayana texts.
*   Later finds from Bamiyan included some Mahayana texts from a later period (late 2nd-4th centuries CE).
*   The most recent discoveries (Bajaur, "split" collections) include Mahayana texts from an earlier period (1st-2nd centuries CE), proving Mahayana was present in Gandhāra earlier than previously thought.

### III.b. The Mahayana and the Mainstream as Seen in Gandhāran Manuscripts

*   Mahayana texts have been found within larger collections of mainstream Buddhist texts.
*   This supports the view that early Mahayana followers were members of mainstream monastic communities (*nikāyas*), not a separate sect.
*   The presence of Mahayana texts in collections associated with different *nikāyas* (e.g., Mahāsāṃghika, Dharmaguptaka) suggests Mahayana ideas were not confined to a single school.
*   Caution is needed, as the presence of a text does not automatically prove its acceptance; it could have been collected for criticism or scholarly purposes.

### III.c. Manifestations of the Mahayana in Manuscripts and Inscriptions

*   The previous lack of Mahayana references in early inscriptions was interpreted as evidence of its marginal status.
*   The new manuscript evidence suggests an alternative interpretation: since Mahayana adherents were part of mainstream monasteries, donative inscriptions would name the monastery's official *nikāya* affiliation, making the individual's *yāna* affiliation irrelevant for the inscription.
*   Therefore, the silence of inscriptions does not prove the absence of Mahayana.

### III.d. The Language(s) of the Mahayana

*   The discovery of very early Mahayana sutras in Gāndhārī challenges the traditional association of Mahayana with the Sanskrit language.
*   These Gāndhārī versions predate known Sanskrit ones, suggesting the original "language of conception" for many early Mahayana texts was a vernacular Middle Indo-Aryan language like Gāndhārī, not Sanskrit.

## IV. CONCLUSION

*   New Gāndhārī manuscript discoveries provide concrete evidence for the presence of Mahayana in Gandhāra at a very early period.
*   The evidence suggests Mahayana existed as a movement within mainstream monastic communities.
*   These findings complicate the history of early Mahayana, and further study and discoveries will continue to change our understanding.
