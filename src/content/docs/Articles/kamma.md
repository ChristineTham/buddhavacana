It is also worth noting that, although dependent origination is compatible with the notion of "rebirth", and implies that our present (mental) condition can be traced back to past mental constructs, the Khandhaka does not really reference either `kamma` or the notion of rebirth.

Therefore, I suggest these concepts were not originally taught by the Buddha, but may be later clarifications (by himself or his disciples).

Many Buddhists believe the Buddha "invented" the concepts of `kamma` and rebirth but as [^GreaterMagadha] points out, both notions were prevalent in other beliefs during the Buddha's time, and form part of the "fundamental spiritual ideology" of the Greater Magadha region. However, the notion of `kamma` in these beliefs was different from how the Buddha's later teachings defined it.

[^GreaterMagadha]: Bronkhorst, J. (2007). Greater Magadha. Brill.

`kamma` was regarded as the accummulation of spiritual "baggage" that "burden" or "encumber" the "soul", and cause rebirth. The metaphor is that `kamma` acts as a "weight" that binds the soul to another birth upon death (rather than presumably allowing the soul to ascend into heaven and even ultimately becoming completely free). The greater the "karmic burden", the lower the level of existence of the rebirth. Please note, this was not necessarily the Buddha's belief (he was probably ambivalent about whether this notion is true or not), but represents prevalent belief during his time.

It is also important to differentiate between the "traditional" notion of `kamma` vs how the Buddha has subsequently redefined it. The traditional view is that *all* actions leads to the accumulation of `kamma`, including both morally "good" actions and morally "bad" actions. The idea is that all actions have an element of "impurity", even supposedly innocuous actions such as sitting still breathing quietly (apparently even then it was recognised mere breathing can harm other, microscopic, living creatures).

This led to the following different set of beliefs based on the above premise:

- Early Jainism: All actions lead to the accummulation of `kamma`, so to achieve liberation *all* activity must be suppressed. This led to the development of extreme ascetic practices — in which practitioners would remain motionless for very long stretches of time, and self-motification was interpreted as bringing about the destruction of the traces of earlier deeds that had not yet suffered retribution. This is described in the earliest books of the Śvetāmbara Jaina canon. The practitioner practices absorptive meditation (`sukkajjhāṇa`), abstains from food and eventually even breathing, and obtains liberation (from the cycle of rebirths) hopefully moments before death.
- Brahmanism: The Jain perspective was also adopted in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad and mentioned in the Bhagavadgītā (according to [^GreaterMagadha])
- Ājīvikism: According to Bronkhorst, they also believed in the extreme ascetic practice of "voluntary death by starvation" but crucially did not believe this would hasten liberation, because they believed in a deterministic universe governed by the principle of order (`niyati`). There is no cause or basis for the purity of living beings, and all living beings must "serve their time" across 8,400,000 great `kappa`s (each `kappa` represents an aeon, or cycle of the evolution and dissolution of the universe). This did not necessarily preclude a belief in `kamma`, and perhaps the Ājīvikas regarded it as a principle similar to entropy, so there is still a benefit in reducing `kamma` to a minimum in a deterministic universe, hence the ascetic practices.

As we can see, dependent origination is a radically original idea and necessitates a reconsideration of `kamma`. `kamma` is redefined (either by the Buddha or his disciples, presumably after the events narrated in the Khandhaka) as not necessarily caused by action, but by mental constructs, specifically "intention". Therefore `kamma` is an accummulation of previous mental constructs resulting in current mental condition.

However, note that the "Buddhist" concept of `kamma` is not present in dependent origination. According to dependent origination, liberation is not dependent on accumulated `kamma`, it is achieved by the cessation of non-optimal mental constructions. There is nothing in the Buddha's conception of dependent origination that suggests existing or accummulated `kamma` will help or hinder the cessation and subsequent liberation. This is why I suggested the Buddha probably did not originally teach the concept of `kamma`, because it was irrelevant to the path to liberation, but it is useful as an "explanation" for current mental state.

Unfortunately, as [^Bronkhorst1998] noted, the "[traditional] concept of karma keep on popping up within the Buddhist tradition. Interestingly, such practices and ideas are often presented as correct at one place in the early texts, and criticized and rejected at another.", Indeed, "... practices and ideas corresponding to the non-Buddhist concept of karma continued to exert an attraction on the Buddhists, even long after the days of 'early Buddhism'. I there drew attention to the practice of physical inactivity advocated by the Chinese master called Mahāyāna in the 8th century in Tibet, and to the tathāgatagarbha doctrine in Mahāyāna Buddhism, which is so close to the non-Buddist idea of an inactive self that even some Buddhist texts draw attention to it." Often, modern Buddhists sometimes describe `kamma` more from the perspective of the "traditional" notion rather than the redefined "Buddhist" concept.
