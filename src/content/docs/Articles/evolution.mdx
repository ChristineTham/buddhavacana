We can never be entirely sure what the Buddha taught, let alone how his teachings may have evolved over his lifetime, and after his death.

However, various scholars have pointed out there seems to be a progressive evolution of the Buddha's teachings over a long period, by examining the structure of the various Buddhist canons, and in particular how the canons of various sects align (or don't align) with other.

The Buddha lived and died before the introduction of writing in ancient India (although some Buddhists claim he learnt Brahmi as a child). His teachings would have been preserved through word of mouth by various disciples, and after his death there were probably many attempts to collect and systematise his teachings. His teachings were preserved through an oral tradition of chanting for centuries before being written down, so classifying and grouping the teachings into chunks that could be memorised was important early on.

These attempts resulted in various "strata" or layers of the Buddha's teachings, starting with the core concepts and gradually expanding by incorporating additions. The additional material may have originated with the Buddha over his lifetime of teaching but could also represent concepts created by disciples after his death.

## The first layer - the Early Discourses

The Buddha's first discourse is supposedly the setting forth the Wheel of Dhamma (the rolling of the perceptual experience of phenomena). This is universally agreed by all Buddhists and all sects as the core of his teachings, but the various sects have captured different variations of it. The Pāḷi version in the Suttapiṭaka is the [14S5/12.2.1 Dhammacakkappavattanasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/14S5/12/12.2/12.2.1.html)

Regardless, some scholars believe the Dhammacakkappavattana may not have been historically accurate, and may reflect a later restructure of what is regarded as his core teachings into a context of him giving his first discourse to his five former companions, leading to all five becoming the first awakened disciples under his guidance.

From a "numerology" perspective, the sutta features the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12 - which is probably not accidental:

* 1 `dhamma` (the principle of phenomenal experience)
* 2 `antā` (extremes)
* 3 `parivaṭṭa` (phases of turning of the Wheel)
* 4 `ariyasaccāni` (realisations)
* 5 `khandhā` (collections)
* 8 parts in the `maggo` (path)
* 12 `ākāra` (aspects of realisation)

The Second Discourse ([13S3/1.2.1.7 Anattalakkhaṇasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/13S3/1/1.2/1.2.1/1.2.1.7.html)) is an exposition of the five `khandhā` and how they are impermanent, create the mistaken perception of a self, which end up in suffering.

The Third Discourse ([13S4/1.4.3.8 Ādittapariyāyasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/13S4/1/1.4/1.4.3/1.4.3.8.html)) introduces the concept of the six senses and how they fuel the five collections and cause them to "burn".

Thus from a numerology perspective the first three discourses feature the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12. This arrangement is not just superstition regarding numbers, it is a convenient way of arranging the concepts in a numerically ascending order for easy memorisation.

Later on the sequence was expanded to included the number 7 (Seven sets of factors related to awakening or `bodhipakkhiyā dhammā`), and 9 `aṅgā` (limbs). Over time even more numbers were added, creating what would become the Aṅguttara Nikāya in the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka (and similar collections in the other canons).

## Elaboration of the Wheel of Dhamma

The concepts underneath the Wheel of Dhamma discourse were also gradually elaborated, through the

* Saccavibhangga Sutta (explains more of the terminology)
* Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (adds more material)
* Abhidhamma Vibhangga (adds more analysis).

Arguably the entire Pāḷi Tipiṭaka can be regarded as a massive elaboration of the Wheel of Dhamma, and almost all the content can be related back to these core concepts.

## Factors related to awakening

The seven sets are an important doctrinal list which appears in the early texts is the "thirty seven qualities that are conducive to awakening" (`bodhipakkhiyā dhammā`). This appears in various suttas and in the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra, where it is said to have been taught by the Buddha just before passing away.

## `Aṅgā` (or "limbs")

An early method of classification divided the Buddha's teachings into 3 sections (`Sutta`, `Geyya`, and `Veyyakarana`). This classification can still be observed in the various Nikāyas and Āgamas of the various canons, where suttas of similar classifications are often grouped together. Over time the classifications extended into 9 categories (`navaṅga`). These nine categories are based on content, structure or literary style:

1. `Sutta` (`Sūtra`[S]): prose discourses, especially short declarative discourses, attributed to the Buddha himself. Also refers to the early portions of the Thera/Therīgāthā and the Sutta Nipāta
2. `Geyya` (`Geya`[S]): mixed prose and verse discourse. Identified with the Sagāthāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya
3. `Veyyakarana` (`Vyākarana`[S]): explanation, analysis, often by disciples. Discourses in question and answer format.
4. `Gāthā`: verse
5. `Udāna`: inspired speech. Eg, Dhammapāda and the Udāna
6. `Itivuttaka` (`Ityukta`[S]): fables, eg. Itivuttaka
7. `Jātaka`: story of a previous life of the Buddha
8. `Abbhutadhamma` (`Abhutadharma`[S]): concerning wonders and miraculous events, eg. Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta (MN 123/MA 32), the Bakkula Sutta (MN 124/MA 34)
9. `Vedalla` (`Vaipulya`[S]) either 'extended discourses' or 'those giving joy' (cf Mahayana Texts) eg. MN 43/MA 211, MN 44/MA 44

Even later still, the Nagarjuna expanded this to 12 `aṅgā` in the `Maha Prajnaparamita Sastra`, a commentary on the Mahāyāna text `Pancavimsatisahasrika Prajnaparamita` (“the perfection of wisdom in five thousand lines”):

* `Sūtra` (discourses)
* `Geya` (mixed prose and verse)
* `Vyākaraṇa` (explanations)
* `Gāthā` (verses)
* `Udāna` (exclamations)
* `Nidāna` (causes or origins)
* `Avadāna` (heroic deeds)
* `Itivṛttaka` (stories)
* `Jātaka` (birth stories)
* `Vaipulya` (expansions)
* `Adbhuta-dharma` (miracles)
* `Upadeśa` (instructions) 

These 12 `aṅgā` parallel the Jain 12 `aṅgā` that symbolise foundational teachings comprising sacred principles, texts, and practices that guide ethical and spiritual conduct, reflecting a structured approach to spiritual awakening. The 12 limbs are also a reference to the 12 set of linked causes in the dependent origination chain.

It is debatable whether the suttas were ever strictly organised by `aṅga`, as some suttas seem to have a combination of multiple characteristics.
