:::caution
Please note that the opinions expressed in this article are not mine, I am just summarising what appears to be a popular view amongst Buddhists. I do not believe the Buddha's teachings are no longer effective, although I do note that they are highly elaborated and may be poorly understood, therefore it is hard to distinguish between what the Buddha might have taught and what have been added on over the years. Therefore I appreciate that the teachings can perhaps be easily misinterpreted leading to ineffectual observance and practice. On that basis, Buddhism can be considered a "failed religion" in that it is generally not effective for it's adherents and practitioners, notwithstanding that the teachings may originally have validity.
:::

Some Buddhist practitioners and scholars believe that sometime after the 1st century CE the Buddha's teachings became no longer effective and practitioners were no longer able to achieve enlightenment.  This view is mainly held amongst Theravādins (who also believe it takes many lifetimes to realise nibbāna), although some Mahāyānans also seem to believe this. The last known arahant (enlightened being) - at least amongst Theravādins - lived around that time. The Mahāyānans have been traditionally more relaxed about declaring individuals as arhats, bodhisattvas or even Buddhas but even so living acknowledged awakened ones are few and far between.

According to Gombrich in p. 168n of [**Theravāda Buddhism**](https://www.academia.edu/4482905/Theravada_Buddhism_by_Richard_Gombrich):

>In Sinhalese public opinion there seem always to have been two conflicting views about the state of the Sāsana. The view that it is in decline goes back, we saw, to the Buddha himself. There is a popular tradition in Sri Lanka that the last Enlightened person in the country died in the first century BCE. On the other hand, the Pali commentaries and chronicles both state and imply that ancient Ceylon was full of Enlightened monks. There are even anecdotes about how people tested or contested claims to sainthood. Curious laymen devised little ruses to see whether an alleged saint took fright easily or salivated at the sight of food. A major component of the popular image of the saint was that he controlled his body and always preserved decorum. Rahula sums up his fascinating chapter on this topic by saying that saints ‘were evidently not expected to be entirely free from . . . minor blemishes, such as pride and love of display’, but ‘should have a reputation for deep piety and scrupulousness in observing the precepts’ – and miraculous powers were a bonus. I doubt whether expectations are very different today.

According to Jayarava in [**Why Did Buddhists Abandon Buddhavacana?**](https://jayarava.blogspot.com/2023/11/why-did-buddhists-abandon-buddhavana.html):

>As far as I can see, all Buddhist sects gradually moved away from buddhavacana and adopted novel doctrines over time. Even the venerable Theravāda tradition — whose own mythology includes the claim to have preserved the entire oeuvre of the Buddha in the very language that he spoke — moved substantially away from those texts. Modern Theravāda is actually based on the writings of Buddhaghosa, a fifth century commentator, and on medieval sub-commentaries on Abhidhamma, such as the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha. The practice of meditation died out in Theravāda sects and had to be reinvented in the eighteenth century. Indeed, some Theravādins have argued that liberation from rebirth is impossible in the absence of a living Buddha.

I disagree with Jayarava's statement that "modern Theravāda is actually based on the writings of Buddhaghosa" and Abhidhamma commentaries although it seems other scholars such as Gombrich also believe this (he once remarked that Rahula's book "What the Buddha Taught" should probably be renamed "What Buddhaghosa Taught"). However, I do agree that the various practices of meditation done by Theravādins and modern Buddhists are a late invention.

Regardless, it is popularly believed there are no known living arahants, or even known arahants in recent memory. Some have claimed they are arahants but not generally accepted, others have been suspected or assumed to be arahants, and there may be arahants who have not declared themselves and are therefore unknown.

To be fair, the Buddha has acknowledged that liberation may be difficult to some, perhaps most. According to [３V／1.5 Brahmayācanakathā](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/3V/1/1.5.html), he was disinclined to teach others at first:

The Buddha was eventually persuaded to teach by none other than Brahmā Sahampati (supposedly the Vedic Supreme Being).

However, Buddhism today is a religion that includes beliefs, customs and practices that were not taught or endorsed by the Buddha. These are documented by Gombrich in [**Theravāda Buddhism: A social history from ancient Benares to modern Colombo**](https://www.academia.edu/4482905/Theravada_Buddhism_by_Richard_Gombrich) and Spiro in [**Buddhism and society : a great tradition and its Burmese vicissitudes**](https://archive.org/details/buddhismsocietyg0000spir).

Buddhism today is divided into various sects, and the beliefs of the sects do not always overlap. There are also modern forms of Buddhism which may or may not incorporate all the "original" teachings of the Buddha. Some have replaced Buddha's teachings, and sometimes even the Buddha himself, with "newer" and "improved" teachings.

Buddhism is primarily practised by the various sects and groups of monastics (who do not always agree with each other), or by "lay disciples." The major sects all have their own version of the Buddhist teachings, with some considerable differences between them.

Indeed, some individuals who claim to be arahants, such as Daniel Ingram, are generally not acknowledged as such by all Buddhists. It seems it would not be appropriate for Buddhists of one sect to acknowledge that there are awakened ones belonging to other sects. So we are left with rumours and secret whispers that "so-and-so" is "enlightened" but not general acceptance.

There were issues with quarrels and bad behaviour even during Buddha's lifetime. Take, for example [12S2/5.1.6 Ovādasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/12S2/5/5.1/5.1.6.html), where Kassapa complains to the Buddha that lately monks have become hard to admonish, impatient, and don't take instruction respectfully, requiring an intervention by the Buddha:

Even the Buddha noticed that his teachings became less effective over time, due to internal corruption within the Saṅgha. Kassapa asked the Buddha why there are now fewer enlightened beings, but more disciplinary rules. The Buddha replied that the overall quality of members of the community have declined and some don't respect the teachings or the teacher ([12S2/5.1.13 Saddhammappatirūpakasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/12S2/5/5.1/5.1.13.html)):

The arch-nemesis during Buddha's lifetime was no doubt Devadatta, who tried to take over the community, caused a formal schism in the Saṅgha, and even tried unsuccessfully to kill the Buddha in [4V/7 Saṃghabhedakakkhandhaka](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/4V/7.html)

Given the "schism" of Buddhism into various sects, the potential "corruption" in the Buddha's teachings, and the fact that there are no known living arahants, I reluctantly conclude Buddhism is a failed religion, since it is no longer effective by the very standards it sets.
