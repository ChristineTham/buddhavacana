This website is dedicated to my parents, without whom I obviously would not be here. They were my first preceptors, and without their guidance and support I would not have been able to embark on this journey.

I am truly happy and content that they have both achieved the cessation of suffering during their lifetimes, and I have been privileged to witness their journeys and the effort they made. Both of them are beyond suffering now, but I will always remember them somewhere in the collections that I call myself.
