`Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra` (also popularly known as the Diamond Sutra) is a Mahāyāna Buddhist sutra from the genre of Prajñāpāramitā ('perfection of wisdom') sutras. It is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras in East Asia, and it is particularly prominent within the Chan (or Zen) tradition, along with the Heart Sutra. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Sutra)

## What is a `Vajra`?

The `vajra` is a legendary and ritualistic tool or "weapon", symbolizing the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force). It is a round, symmetrical metal scepter with two ribbed spherical heads. The ribs may meet in a ball-shaped top, or they may be separate and end in sharp points. It is often paired with a bell (called `ghanta`).

Therefore it is no surprise that the `Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā` ("Vajra Cutter Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra") is considered one the most celebrated and historically significant works in Mahāyāna Buddhism.

## Overview

This is a subversive sutra, for it "cuts" through "traditional" or "conservative" interpretations of the Buddha's teachings, as represented by the Hīnayāna scriptures (the "lesser way"). It goes through a series of apparent contradictions discussed in dialogues between the Buddha and his disciple Subhūti. These dialogues demolish the idea of inherent existence, and shows that all phenomena are empty of a permanent, independent self-nature (`śūnyatā`). They also emphasise the importance of non-attachment and the practice of compassion towards all beings (because these beings are ultimately lacking in inherent existence as well, our perceptions of them are manifestations of ourselves).

It is important, however, to understand this sutra does not repudiate the so-called Hīnayāna texts. The concept of `śūnyatā` is consistent with the Buddha's early teachings as represented in the Mahākhandhaka.

It is a fine line between understanding that everything we experience are mere perceptual constructs without inherent existence, and believing the "world is an illusion". The former is taught by the Buddha, the latter is a common misunderstanding typical of translations of this and other Mahāyāna sutras. The sutra warns against this by emphasising the importance of compassion and altruistic action, even while recognising the emptiness of all phenomena.

Ultimately, complete liberation requires the liberation of all beings, as they are manifestations of ourselves. This is the main reason why everyone should aspire to be a Buddha and undertake the `bodhisattva`-way.

These contradictions discussed in the sutra include:

- The Buddha liberating other living beings - even though the concept of a "living being" is a mere perception (and therefore no actual living being is liberated).
- Perception of a `ātmasaṃjñā` (self), `satvasaṃjñā` (being), `jīvasaṃjñā` (life-force), `pudgalasaṃjñā` (person), or even `dharma`.
- Giving gifts without being based or dependent on any `vastu` (object), the five collections (`skhandhas`), `dharmas` (mental-objects/phenomena), or even `nimittasaṃjñāyāṃ` (perception of a sign). Gifts and acts of "kindness" must be intrinsically "good" and not attached to any perception of self, other, or phenomena.
- Perceiving the Buddha through his `lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (physical characteristics) or 32 marks.
- The effectiveness of the Buddha's teachings in the future.
- The nature of ultimate enlightenment (`anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhiḥ`) and the nature of `dharmas` (phenomena).
- The "merit" of precious gifts compared to the "merit" of disseminating the teachings.
- The attainments of `srotāpanna` (stream-enterer), etc. up to `arhat` (worthy one). These are also empty of inherent substance.
- The understanding of `dharma` itself.
- `dharmaparyāya` (method of teaching).
- `bhūtasaṃjñām` (true perception) vs `asaṃjñā` (non-perception).
- `ātmabhāvān` (physical self)
- `kṣetravyūhas` (arrangement of field, possibly an epithet for establishing an "buudha field").
- `lokadhātus` (world systems)
- `cittadhārā` (stream of thought)
- `puṇyaskandha` (mass of merit)
- `rūpakāya` (form-body)
- destruction and annihilation of phenomenon
- `piṇḍagrāha` (grasp of substance)
- `ātmadṛṣṭi` (view of self)
- `dharmasaṃjñā` (perception of phenomenon)

The sutra stresses that all the above concepts are ultimately empty of inherent existence, and that the `bodhisattva`-way is to be undertaken without attachment to any of these concepts.

The following is my translation of this text, based on two separate manuscripts (corresponding to editions 8 and 10 above):

* Schøyen Collection MS2385, presumed to have come from Afghanistan, possibly the Bamiyan area, and is dated on paleographical grounds to the 6th–7th CE. It preserves roughly the first half of the text, in a continuous run over fols. 26–46 (corrresponding to §§1–16c).
* Gilgit Vajracchedikā, discovered in Northern Pakistan in 1931, and subsequently edited by Schopen (1989), also dated to approximately 6th–7th CE. It preserves the last two thirds, on fols. 5–12, but with the loss of one folio, No. 6 (thus covering §§13b–14e, 15b–32b).

Together, there is enough overlap and similarities between the two manuscripts to create a "Frankenstein" edition of the entire sutra (combining the two manuscripts) that gives an indication of the form in which the sutra was circulating in the area of Greater Gandhāra in the 6th and 7th centuries A.D.

As an alternative, Alex Johnson created the [Diamond Sutra](https://diamond-sutra.com) website and composite translation by taking 15 different previous translations of the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (presumably from Chinese editions). Every element that was common through each of the translations was kept.

Venerable Lian Sheng has also created a translation of the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra and commentary in [The Vajra Sutra](https://vajrasutra.org) based on (presumably) a Chinese edition.

**Homage to Śākyamuni, the `tathāgata` (Thus-gone), the `arhat` (Worthy One), the `samyaksaṃbuddha` (Perfectly and Completely Awake One).**

Thus have I heard. At one time the Bhagavān was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada's park, together with a great assembly of monks (`bhikṣusaṃghena`), with twelve hundred and fifty monks.

Then, the Bhagavān, in the forenoon, having put on his lower robe, taking his bowl and upper robe, entered the great city of Śrāvastī for alms. Then, the Bhagavān, having wandered for alms in the great city of Śrāvastī, having returned from the alms-round after the meal, washed his feet, and the Bhagavān sat down on the prepared seat, folding his legs cross-wise, holding his body erect, establishing mindfulness (`smṛtim`) before him. Then many bhikṣavaḥ approached where the Bhagavān was. Having approached, they bowed their heads to the Bhagavān's feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān three times, and sat down to one side.

Now at that time, the āyuṣmān Subhūti was present in that very assembly, seated. Then the āyuṣmān Subhūti rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee-circle on the ground, extended his folded hands toward the Bhagavān, and said this to the Bhagavān:

> Wonderful, Bhagavān, to what extent the `tathāgata`, the `arhat`, the `samyaksaṃbuddha` has favoured the `bodhisattvas` (enlightenment-beings), the `mahāsattvas` (great-beings), with the highest favour! To what extent the `tathāgata` has entrusted the `bodhisattvas` with the highest entrustment! How, Bhagavān, should one who has set out in the `bodhisattva`-way (`bodhisatvayāna`) stand? How should they train? How should they control their mind (`citta`)?

This having been said, the Bhagavān said this to the āyuṣmān Subhūti:

> Good, good, Subhūti! It is just so, Subhūti. The `tathāgata` has favored the `bodhisattvas` with the highest favour. The `tathāgata` has entrusted the `bodhisattvas` with the highest entrustment. Therefore, Subhūti, listen well and properly bear it in mind. I will explain how one who has set out in the `bodhisattva`-way should stand, how they should train, and how they should control their mind.

"So be it, Bhagavān," the āyuṣmān Subhūti replied to the Bhagavān.

There is no `dharma` whatsoever that was taught by the `tathāgata`. Why is that? That `dharma` taught by the `tathāgata` — it is ungraspable, inexpressible. It is neither `dharma` nor non-`dharma`. Why is that? Because the "noble" (liberated) persons (`āryapudgalāḥ`) are distinguished by the unconstructed (`asaṃskṛta`).

> What do you think, Subhūti? If some son or daughter of good family were to fill this three-thousand-great-thousand world-system (`tṛsāhasramahāsāhasrāṃ lokadhātuṃ`) with the seven precious jewels and give it as a gift — what do you think, Subhūti? Would that son or daughter of good family produce much merit (`puṇyaṃ`)?

Subhūti said:

> Much, Bhagavān, much, *sugata*. That son or daughter of good family would produce much merit. Why is that? That merit, Bhagavān, is a non-collection (`askandhaḥ`). Therefore the `tathāgata` speaks of the 'store of merit' (`puṇyaskandhaḥ`) as 'non-store'.

The Bhagavān said:

> And yet, Subhūti, if a son or daughter of good family were to fill this three-thousand-great-thousand world-system with the seven precious jewels and give it as a gift, and if another were to take from this `dharmaparyāya` (method of teaching) even just a four-line verse (`gāthām`), teach it to others, and illuminate it — this latter one would produce far more merit on that account, immeasurable, incalculable.
>
> Why is that? Because from this, Subhūti, is born the `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhiḥ` of the `tathāgatas`. And from this are born the Buddhas, the Bhagavāns. Why is that? 'Buddha-dharmas', 'Buddha-dharmas', Subhūti — they are indeed non-Buddha-dharmas.

> What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to a `srotāpanna` (stream-enterer) 'The fruit of stream-entry has been attained by me'?

Subhūti said:

> No indeed, Bhagavān.

The Bhagavān said:

> Why is that? Because, Bhagavān, he has not entered anything. Therefore he is called a 'stream-enterer'. He has not entered form, nor sounds, nor smells, nor tastes, nor tangibles, nor `dharmas`. Therefore he is called a 'stream-enterer'.

The Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to a `sakṛdāgāmin` (once-returner) 'The fruit of once-returning has been attained by me'?

Subhūti said:

> No indeed, Bhagavān.

The Bhagavān said:

> Why is that? It does not occur to a `sakṛdāgāmin`, 'The fruit of once-returning has been attained by me.' Why is that? Because there is no `dharma` whatsoever that has attained 'once-returning'. Therefore he is called a 'once-returner'.

The Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to an `anāgāmin` (non-returner) 'The fruit of non-returning has been attained by me'? Why is that? Because there is no `dharma` whatsoever that he perceives as 'non-returner'. Therefore he is called a 'non-returner'.

The Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to an `arhat` (worthy one) 'Arhatship has been attained by me'?

Subhūti said:

> No indeed, Bhagavān. Why is that? Because, Bhagavān, there is no `dharma` whatsoever that is named 'arhat'. If, Bhagavān, it were to occur to an `arhat` 'Arhatship has been attained by me,' that itself would be for him a grasping at self (`ātmagrāho`), a grasping at a being, a grasping at a life-force, a grasping at a person.

And yet, Bhagavān, it does not occur to me 'I am an `arhat`'. If, Bhagavān, it were to occur to me 'Arhatship has been attained by me,' the `tathāgata` would not have declared of me:

The Bhagavān said:

'Field-adornments', 'field-adornments', Subhūti—these have been taught by the `tathāgata` as non-adornments (`avyūhā`). Therefore they are called 'field-adornments'.

> Therefore, then, Subhūti, a `bodhisattva` should produce an unestablished (`apratiṣṭhitaṃ`) thought. A thought should be produced that is not established in form. A thought should be produced that is not established in sound, smell, taste, tangibles, or `dharmas`. A thought should be produced that is not established anywhere.

> Suppose, Subhūti, there were a man whose self-existence (`ātmabhāvaḥ`) was of such a form as Sumeru, king of mountains. What do you think, Subhūti? Would that self-existence be great?

Subhūti said:

> Great, Bhagavān, great, *sugata*, would that self-existence be, Bhagavān. Why is that? It has been taught by the `tathāgata` as non-existence (`abhāvaḥ`). Therefore it is called 'self-existence'. For it is not an existence. Therefore it is called 'self-existence'.

That which is the 'world-system' (`lokadhātur`), as 'non-system' (`adhātuḥ`) it was taught by the `tathāgata`. Therefore it is called 'world-system'.

Then, the āyuṣmān Subhūti, moved by the `dharma`, shed tears. Wiping away his tears, he said this to the Bhagavān:

> Wonderful, Bhagavān! Supremely wonderful, *sugata*! What an extent this `dharmaparyāya` (method of teaching) has been taught by the `tathāgata`! From which, Bhagavān, knowledge (`jñānam`) has arisen in me. Never before have I heard such a `dharmaparyāya`. They will be endowed, Bhagavān, with the highest wonder, who, when this `sūtra` is being taught, will produce a true perception (`bhūtasaṃjñām`). And this 'true perception', Bhagavān — that is itself a non-perception (`asaṃjñā`). Therefore the `tathāgata` speaks of '`bhūtasaṃjñām`, `bhūtasaṃjñām`'.
>
> It is no wonder to me, Bhagavān, that I understand and accept this `dharmaparyāya` as it is being taught. But those, Bhagavān, who will take up, master, and uphold this `dharmaparyāya` — they will be endowed with the highest wonder.
> 
> Furthermore, Bhagavān, a perception of self (`ātmasaṃjñā`) will not occur to them, nor a perception of a being, nor a perception of a life-force, nor a perception of a person. Why is that? Because that 'perception of self' is itself a non-perception. That 'perception of a being', 'perception of a life-force', 'perception of a person' — that is itself a non-perception. Why is that? Because the Buddhas, the Bhagavāns, are free from all perceptions.

This having been said, the Bhagavān said this to the āyuṣmān Subhūti:

> Just so, Subhūti, just so. Those beings will be endowed with the highest wonder, who, upon hearing this `sūtra` being taught, will not be terrified, will not be frightened, will not fall into terror. Why is that? This is the highest perfection (`paramapāramitā`), Subhūti, taught by the `tathāgata`. And that which the `tathāgata` teaches as the 'highest perfection', that is taught also by immeasurable Buddhas and Bhagavāns. Therefore it is called the 'highest perfection'.
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, the `tathāgata`'s perfection of patience (`kṣāṃtipāramitā`) — that is itself a non-perfection (`apāramitā`). Why is that? When, Subhūti, the King of Kaliṅga cut my limbs and joints, at that time I had no perception of self, or perception of a being, or perception of a life-force, or perception of a person. I had neither any perception nor non-perception. Why is that? If, Subhūti, at that time I had had a perception of self, a perception of ill-will (`vyāpādasaṃjñā`) would also have been present in me at that time. I recall, Subhūti, in a past time, five hundred births ago, when I was the sage 'Preacher of Patience' (`kṣāṃtivādī`), even then I had no perception of self, no perception of a being, no perception of a life-force, no perception of a person.
> 
> Therefore, then, Subhūti, a `bodhisattva`, a `mahāsattva`, having abandoned all perceptions, should produce the thought of `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhiḥ` (unexcelled, perfect, complete enlightenment). A thought should be produced that is not established in form. A thought should be produced that is not established in sound, smell, taste, or tangibles. A thought should be produced that is not established in `dharma`. A thought should be produced that is not established in non-`dharma`. A thought should be produced that is not established anywhere. Why is that? Because that which is established is itself the unestablished. Therefore the `tathāgata` teaches: 'A gift should be given unestablished in form.'
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, a `bodhisattva` should make this renunciation of a gift (`dānaparityāgaḥ`) in this way, for the sake of all beings. And the very 'perception of a being' — that is a non-perception. Those very 'all beings' taught by the `tathāgata` — they are non-beings. The `tathāgata` is a speaker of the real (`bhūtavādī`), Subhūti, a speaker of the true (`satyavādī`), a speaker of the thusness (`tathāvādī`), the `tathāgata` is not a speaker of the false (`vitathāvādī`).
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, that `dharma` which was fully awakened to or taught by the `tathāgata` — in it there is neither truth nor falsehood. Suppose, Subhūti, there were a man who has entered the darkness. Thus is a `bodhisattva` to be seen who has become dependent on objects (`vastupatito`), who renounces a gift having become dependent on objects. Suppose, Subhūti, there were a man with sight, when the night has dawned and the sun has risen, who would see various forms. Thus is a `bodhisattva` to be seen who renounces a gift without becoming dependent on objects.
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, those sons or daughters of good family who will take up this `dharmaparyāya`, uphold it, recite it, master it — they are known, Subhūti, by the `tathāgata`; they are seen, Subhūti, by the `tathāgata`; they are understood (`buddhās`) by the `tathāgata`. All those beings will produce an immeasurable store of merit (`puṇyaskandhaṃ`).

> And yet, Subhūti, if a woman or man were to renounce physical self (`ātmabhāvān`) equal to the grains of sand in the Ganges river in the forenoon, and in the middle of the day, and in the evening were to renounce physical selves equal to the grains of sand in the Ganges river, and in this way were to renounce physical selves for hundreds of thousands of millions of billions (`koṭīnayutaśatasahasrāṇy`) of eons (`kalpa`); and if another, having heard this `dharmaparyāya`, should not reject it — this one would produce far more merit on that account, immeasurable, incalculable. How much more so one who, having written it, would take it up, uphold it, recite it, master it, and explain it to others in detail!
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, this `dharmaparyāya` is inconceivable (`aciṃtyo`), incomparable (`atulyo`). And this `dharmaparyāya` was taught by the `tathāgata` for the sake of beings who have set out in the highest vehicle (`agrayāna`), for the sake of beings who have set out in the best vehicle (`śreṣṭhayāna`). Those who will take up this `dharmaparyāya`, uphold it, recite it, master it — they are known, Subhūti, by the `tathāgata`; they are seen, Subhūti, by the `tathāgata`. All those beings will be endowed with an immeasurable store of merit, endowed with an inconceivable, incomparable, unmeasurable, limitless store of merit. Why is that? Because, Subhūti, this `dharma` cannot be heard by those of inferior resolve (`hīnādhimuktikaiḥ`). It cannot be heard, taken up, upheld, recited, or mastered by those with a view of self (`ātmadṛṣṭikaiḥ`), or a view of a being, or a view of a life-force, or a view of a person. This is not possible.
> 
> Furthermore, Subhūti, whatever spot of earth where this `sūtra` will be taught, that spot of earth will become worthy of worship (`pūjanīyaḥ`). It will become worthy of reverence and circumambulation by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras. That spot of earth will become a `caitya` (shrine).

## Gilgit Vajracchedikā

:::caution
The Gilgit manuscript is a fragment missing the first 4 sectionas (as well as §§6), and appears to be poorly edited as the text rambles on with some repeated concepts. I suspect the text includes some sections that are later additions to the sutra.

### §§5

<Tabs syncKey="sanskrit">
<TabItem label="Translation">
... Bhagavān said:

> As many, Subhūti, as are the dust particles in the three-thousand-great-thousand `lokadhātu` (world-system), would that be much?

He said:

> Much, Bhagavān, is that dust. It is spoken of by the `Tathāgata` as non-dust, therefore it is called 'dust particle'. And that which is the `lokadhātu` (world-system), that is a non-system spoken of by the `Tathāgata`, therefore it is called '`lokadhātu`'.

Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti, is the `Tathāgata` to be seen by the thirty-two `mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇas` (marks of a great man)?
 
He said:

> No, Bhagavān. For what reason? Those thirty-two `mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇas` that were spoken of by the `Tathāgata` are non-marks, therefore they are called 'the thirty-two `mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇas`'.

Bhagavān said:

> And furthermore, Subhūti, if a woman or a man were to renounce physical selves equal to the sands of the river Ganges, and if someone, having learned from this `dharmaparyāya` (method of teaching) at least a four-lined verse, should teach it to others, this one on that account would generate much `puṇya` (merit), immeasurable, innumerable.

Then, indeed, the āyuṣmān Subhūti, from the force of the `dharma` (teaching), shed tears. Wiping away his tears, he said this to the Bhagavān:

> Wonderful, Bhagavān, most wonderful, Sugata, is this `dharmaparyāya` spoken by the `Tathāgata`! From it, Bhagavān, knowledge has arisen in me. Never before has this `dharmaparyāya` been heard by me. Endowed with the highest wonder will they be, Bhagavān, who, when this `sūtra` is being spoken, produce a `bhūtasaṃjñā` (perception of reality). And this, Bhagavān, which is a `bhūtasaṃjñā`, that itself is not a `bhūtasaṃjñā`. Therefore the `Tathāgata` speaks of: '`bhūtasaṃjñā`, `bhūtasaṃjñā`'.
>
> It is no wonder to me, Bhagavān, that I understand and am convinced of this `dharmaparyāya` as it is being spoken. Those beings, Bhagavān, who will take up this `dharmaparyāya`, who will master it, they will be endowed with the highest wonder. But furthermore, Bhagavān, no `ātmasaṃjñā` (perception of a self) will operate in them, no `satvasaṃjñā` (perception of a being), no `jīvasaṃjñā` (perception of a life-principle), no `pudgalasaṃjñā` (perception of a person). For what reason? The `Buddhas` (awakened ones), the Bhagavāns, are devoid of all perceptions.

Bhagavān said:

>  So it is, Subhūti. Endowed with the highest wonder will they be who, upon hearing this `dharmaparyāya`, will not be terrified, will not be frightened, will not fall into a state of terror. For what reason? This, Subhūti, is the `paramapāramitā` (supreme perfection) spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. And that `paramapāramitā` which the `Tathāgata` speaks of, immeasurable `Buddhas` (awakened ones), Bhagavāns, speak of it. Therefore it is called '`paramapāramitā`'.
>
> But furthermore, Subhūti, that which is the `Tathāgata`'s `kṣāntipāramitā` (perfection of patience), that itself is a no-perfection. For what reason? When, Subhūti, the king of Kali cut the flesh from my limbs, at that time I had no `ātmasaṃjñā` or `satvasaṃjñā` or `jīvasaṃjñā` or `pudgalasaṃjñā`. Had I at that time a perception of ill-will... I recall, Subhūti, in a past time, five hundred births ago, I was the sage who taught patience. Even then I had no `ātmasaṃjñā`, no `satvasaṃjñā`, no `jīvasaṃjñā`, no `pudgalasaṃjñā`. Therefore, then, Subhūti, a `bodhisattva` (enlightenment-being), a `mahāsattva` (great being), having abandoned all perceptions ...

> ... All those beings will bear my `aṃsa` (share) of `bodhi` (awakening). For what reason? It is not possible, Subhūti, for this `dharmaparyāya` (method of teaching) to be heard by beings of `hīnādhimuktika` (inferior resolve), nor is it possible for it to be heard, taken up, or mastered by those with an `ātmadṛṣṭika` (view of a self), or a `satva-jīva-pudgala-dṛṣṭika` (view of a being, life-principle, or person). This state of affairs does not exist. But furthermore, Subhūti, whatever spot of earth this `sūtra` shall be proclaimed upon, that spot of earth will be worthy of worship. It will be worthy of veneration and circumambulation by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras. That spot of earth will become like a `caitya` (shrine). Those `kulaputras` (sons of good family) or `kuladuhitṛs` (daughters of good family), Subhūti, who will take up `sūtra` passages of this kind, and master them, they will be despised, utterly despised. And whatever evil `karmas` (actions) of those beings from previous births were `apāyasaṃvartanīyāni` (leading to a lower rebirth), those will be extinguished in this very life through that despisal, and they will attain `buddhabodhi` (the awakening of a Buddha). I recall, Subhūti, in a time past, `asaṃkhyeya` (incalculable) `kalpas` (aeons) ago, more incalculable still, before Dīpaṃkara the `Tathāgata`, `Arhat`, `Samyaksaṃbuddha`, there were eighty-four hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of `Buddhas`, whom I honored, and having honored, did not dishonor. And that I, Subhūti, honored those `Buddhas`, Bhagavāns, and did not dishonor them, and that in the last time, when the final `pañcāśat` (period of five hundred years) is occurring, they will take up these `sūtra` passages, and master them — of this latter `puṇyaskandha` (mass of merit), Subhūti, that former `puṇyaskandha` does not approach even the one-hundredth part, nor the one-thousandth part, nor the one-hundred-thousandth part. It does not bear number, nor fraction, nor counting, nor comparison, nor analogy. Should I, Subhūti, declare the `puṇyaskandha` of those `kulaputras` and `kuladuhitṛs`, to what extent those beings, `kulaputras` and `kuladuhitṛs`, will at that time acquire a `puṇyaskandha`, beings would attain madness or go into mental distraction. But furthermore, Subhūti, this `dharmaparyāya` is inconceivable; its result is likewise inconceivable.

He said:

> How, Bhagavān, should one who has set out in the `bodhisatvayāna` (`bodhisatvayāna`-way) stand, how should one train, how should one control the mind?

Bhagavān said:

> Here, Subhūti, one who has set out in the `bodhisatvayāna` should produce the thought thus: "All beings are to be led by me to final `nirvāṇa` (extinguishment) in the `anupadhiśeṣa nirvāṇadhātu` (realm of extinguishment without remaining residue)." And having thus led beings to final `nirvāṇa`, not a single being has been led to final `nirvāṇa`.

What do you think, Subhūti, is there any `dharma`  by which the `Tathāgata` fully awakened to `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi` (unexcelled perfect and complete awakening) in the presence of the Dīpaṃkara `Tathāgata`?

He said:

> There is no `dharma`, Bhagavān, by which the `Tathāgata` fully awakened to `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi` in the presence of the Dīpaṃkara `Tathāgata`.

Bhagavān said:

> Therefore I was prophesied by the Dīpaṃkara `Tathāgata`: "You, young man, in a future time, will be a `Tathāgata`, `Arhat`, `Samyaksaṃbuddha`, named Śākyamuni." For what reason? '`Tathāgata`', Subhūti, is an epithet for `tathatā` (suchness). Whoever, Subhūti, should say thus: "The `Tathāgata` has fully awakened to `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi`" — there is no `dharma`, Subhūti, that has been fully awakened to as `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi` by the `Tathāgata`. The `dharma`, Subhūti, that was fully awakened to by the `Tathāgata`, therein is neither truth nor falsehood. Therefore the `Tathāgata` says: "All `dharmas` are `buddhadharmas` (phenomena of a Buddha)." 'All `dharmas`', Subhūti, all of them are non-`dharmas`; therefore they are called 'all `dharmas`'.
>
> Just as, for example, Subhūti, there might be a man with a large body, a great body.

Subhūti said:

> That which was spoken of by the `Tathāgata` as a man with a large body, a great body — a non-body, Bhagavān, was spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore he is called 'a man with a large body, a great body'.

Bhagavān said:

> So it is, Subhūti. A `bodhisattva` who would say thus: "I shall lead beings to final `nirvāṇa`" should not be called a '`bodhisattva`'. For what reason? Is there, Subhūti, any `dharma` that is called a '`bodhisattva`'

He said:

> There is not, Bhagavān.

Bhagavān said:

> Therefore the `Tathāgata` says: "All `dharmas` are without being, without life-principle, without person." A `bodhisattva`, Subhūti, who would say thus: "I shall accomplish the `kṣetravyūhas` (literally: arrangements of a field, but presumably an epithet for "establishing a "buddha-field")," he too should be spoken of in the same way. For what reason? '`Kṣetravyūhas`, `kṣetravyūhas`, Subhūti, are non-arrangements spoken of by the `Tathāgata`; therefore they are called '`kṣetravyūhas`'. That `bodhisattva`, Subhūti, who is convinced "`dharmas` are selfless, `dharmas` are selfless," is declared by the `Tathāgata`, the `Arhat`, the `Samyaksaṃbuddha` as '`bodhisattva`, `bodhisattva`'. What do you think, Subhūti, does the `Tathāgata` possess the `māṃsacakṣuḥ` (physical eye)?

He said:

> So it is, Bhagavān, the `Tathāgata` possesses the `māṃsacakṣuḥ` (physical eye).

He said:

> So it is, Bhagavān, the `Tathāgata` possesses the `divyaṃ cakṣuḥ`, the `prajñācakṣuḥ`, the `dharmacakṣuḥ`, the `buddhacakṣuḥ`.

Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and as many `lokadhātus` (world-systems) as the grains of sand in them, would those `lokadhātus` (world-systems) be many?

Bhagavān said:
> As many beings as there are, Subhūti, in those `lokadhātus` (world-systems), I would know their various streams of thought. For what reason? '`Cittadhārā` (stream of thought)', '`cittadhārā`', Subhūti, are non-streams spoken of by the `Tathāgata`; therefore they are called '`cittadhārā`'. For what reason? Past thought, Subhūti, is not apprehended. Future thought is not apprehended. Present thought is not apprehended. What do you think, Subhūti, if a `kulaputra` (son of good family) or `kuladuhitṛ` (daughter of good family), having filled this three-thousand-great-thousand `lokadhātu` with the seven precious things, were to give a gift, would he or she on that account generate much `puṇya` (merit)?

He said:

> Much, Bhagavān, much, Sugata.

Bhagavān said:

> So it is, Subhūti, so it is. That `kulaputra` or `kuladuhitṛ` would on that account generate much `puṇya`. If, Subhūti, a `puṇyaskandha` (mass of merit) existed, the `Tathāgata` would not have said, '`puṇyaskandha`, `puṇyaskandha`'. What do you think, Subhūti, is the `Tathāgata` to be seen by the perfection of the `rūpakāya` (form-body)?

He said:

> No, Bhagavān, the `Tathāgata` is not to be seen by the perfection of the `rūpakāya`. For what reason? 'Perfection of the `rūpakāya`', 'perfection of the `rūpakāya`', this is a no-perfection spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore it is called 'perfection of the `rūpakāya`'.

Bhagavān said:
> What do you think, Subhūti, is the `Tathāgata` to be seen by the `lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (perfection of marks)?

He said:

> No, Bhagavān, the `Tathāgata` is not to be seen by the `lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (perfection of marks). For what reason? That which is the `lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (perfection of marks) spoken of by the `Tathāgata`, this is a no-perfection of marks spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore it is called '`lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (perfection of marks)'.

Bhagavān said:

> What do you think, Subhūti, does it occur to the `Tathāgata` thus: "A `dharma` (teaching) has not been taught by me"? Whoever, Subhūti, should say thus: "A `dharma` has been taught by the `Tathāgata`," he would be slandering me, Subhūti, with what is grasped as untrue. For what reason? 'Discourse on the `Dharma`', 'discourse on the `Dharma`', Subhūti, there is no `dharma` (phenomenon) that is found which is named 'discourse on the `Dharma`'.

He said:

> Are there, Bhagavān, any beings who will exist in a future time, who, upon hearing `dharmas` of this kind being spoken, will have faith?

Bhagavān said:

> They, Subhūti, are not beings, nor non-beings. For what reason? 'All beings', Subhūti, are non-beings spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore they are called 'all beings'.

Bhagavān said:

> So it is, Subhūti, so it is. Not even a minute `dharma` exists or is found there. Therefore it is called '`anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi`'. But furthermore, Subhūti, that `dharma` is equal; there is nothing unequal in it. Therefore it is called '`anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi`'. Through being without life-principle, without being, without person, that same `anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi` is fully awakened to through all wholesome `dharmas`. 'Wholesome `dharmas`', 'wholesome `dharmas`', Subhūti, they are indeed non-`dharmas` spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore they are called 'wholesome `dharmas`'. And furthermore, Subhūti, if someone, having collected heaps of the seven precious things as numerous as the Sumerus, kings of mountains, in the three-thousand-great-thousand `lokadhātu` (world-system), were to give a gift, and if someone, having learned from this `Prajñāpāramitā` at least a four-lined verse, should teach it to others — of this `puṇyaskandha` (mass of merit), Subhūti, that former `puṇyaskandha` does not approach even the one-hundredth part, as far as not bearing even an analogy.
>
> What do you think, Subhūti, does it occur to the `Tathāgata` thus: "Beings have been liberated by me"? Not so, indeed, Subhūti, should it be seen. For what reason? There is no being who has been liberated by the `Tathāgata`. If again, Subhūti, there had been any being who was liberated by the `Tathāgata`, that itself would be for him a grasp of a self, a grasp of a being, a grasp of a life-principle, a grasp of a person. 'Grasp of a self', Subhūti, is a non-grasp spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. And it is grasped by `bālapṛthagjanas` (foolish common people). '`Bālapṛthagjanas`', Subhūti, are no-people spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore they are called '`bālapṛthagjanas`'. What do you think, Subhūti, is the `Tathāgata` to be seen by the `lakṣaṇasaṃpad` (perfection of marks)?

Not, indeed, Subhūti, should a `puṇyaskandha` (mass of merit) be grasped by a `bodhisattva`.

He said:

Bhagavān said:

He said, so it is, Bhagavān, that collection of atoms would be large. For what reason? If, Bhagavān, it were a collection, the Bhagavān would not have said, 'a collection of atoms'. For what reason? That which is called 'a collection of atoms' has been spoken of by the Bhagavān as a no-collection. Therefore it is called 'a collection of atoms'. And that which the `Tathāgata` speaks of as the 'three-thousand-great-thousand `lokadhātu`', that has been spoken of by the `Tathāgata` as a no-system. Therefore it is called the 'three-thousand-great-thousand `lokadhātu`'. For what reason? If, Bhagavān, a system existed, that itself, Bhagavān, would be a `piṇḍagrāha` (grasp of a substance).

'`Dharmasaṃjñā`, '`dharmasaṃjñā`', Subhūti, this is a no-perception spoken of by the `Tathāgata`. Therefore it is called '`dharmasaṃjñā`'. And furthermore, Subhūti, if a `bodhisattva` (enlightenment-being), a `mahāsattva` (great being), having filled immeasurable, innumerable `lokadhātus` (world-systems) with the seven precious things, were to give a gift, and if a `kulaputra` (son of good family) or `kuladuhitṛ` (daughter of good family), having taken from this `Prajñāpāramitā` at least a four-lined verse, were to uphold it, teach it, master it, this one would on that account generate much more `puṇya` (merit), immeasurable, innumerable. And how should one proclaim it? As a no-proclamation one should proclaim it. Therefore it is said 'one should proclaim it'.

> A star, darkness, a lamp, \
> an illusion, dew, a bubble, \
> A dream, a flash of lightning, and a cloud, \
> Thus should the `saṃskṛta` (conditioned) be seen.

This the Bhagavān spoke. The elder Subhūti, with a delighted mind, and those monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced in what the Bhagavān had said.
