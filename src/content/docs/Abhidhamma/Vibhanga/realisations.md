## Catechism

Of the four `ariyasaccānaṃ` (realisations), how many are `kusalā` (wholesome), how many `akusalā` (unwholesome), how many `abyākatā` (indeterminate)… etc.…  how many `saraṇā` (with defilements), how many `araṇā` (without defilements)?

* Samudayasacca (realisation of the origin of suffering) is akusala (unwholesome).
* Maggasacca (realisation of the path) is kusala (wholesome).
* Nirodhasacca (realisation of cessation) is abyākata (undetermined).
* Dukkhasacca (realisation of suffering) may be kusala (wholesome), may be akusala (unwholesome), may be abyākata (undetermined).

Two realisations may be associated with pleasant vedanā (feeling), may be associated with adukkhamasukha vedanā (neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling).

* Nirodhasacca (realisation of cessation) should not be said to be "associated with pleasant vedanā (feeling)," nor "associated with painful vedanā (feeling)," nor "associated with adukkhamasukha vedanā (neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling)."
* Dukkhasacca (realisation of suffering) may be associated with pleasant vedanā (feeling), may be associated with painful vedanā (feeling), may be associated with adukkhamasukha vedanā (neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling), or it should not be said to be "associated with pleasant vedanā (feeling)," nor "associated with painful vedanā (feeling)," nor "associated with adukkhamasukha vedanā (neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling)."

Two realisations are vipākadhammadhammā (states that are conditions for kamma-result).

* Nirodhasacca (realisation of cessation) is nevavipākanavipākadhammadhamma (neither kamma-result nor a condition for kamma-result).
* Dukkhasacca (realisation of suffering) may be vipāka (kamma-result), may be vipākadhammadhamma (a state that is a condition for kamma-result), may be nevavipākanavipākadhammadhamma (neither kamma-result nor a condition for kamma-result).

Samudayasacca (realisation of the origin of suffering) is anupādinnupādāniya (not clung to but subject to clinging).

Two realisations are anupādinnaanupādāniyā (not clung to and not subject to clinging).

* Dukkhasacca (realisation of suffering) may be upādinnupādāniya (clung to and subject to clinging), may be anupādinnupādāniya (not clung to but subject to clinging).

Samudayasacca (realisation of the origin of suffering) is saṃkiliṭṭhasaṃkilesika (defiled and defiling).

Two realisations are asaṃkiliṭṭhaasaṃkilesikā (undefiled and undefiling).

* Dukkhasacca (realisation of suffering) may be saṃkiliṭṭhasaṃkilesika (defiled and defiling), may be asaṃkiliṭṭhasaṃkilesika (undefiled and undefiling).

827\. Samudayasacca (realisation of the origin of suffering) is savitakkasavicāra (with initial application and sustained application of thought). Nirodhasacca (realisation of cessation) is avitakkaavicāra (without initial application and without sustained application of thought).
