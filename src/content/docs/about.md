## 𑀩𑀼𑀤𑁆𑀥𑀯𑀘𑀦 is `buddhavacana` (in Brahmi script)

`buddhavacana` is a Pāḷi word meaning "the word (or the utterance) of the Buddha."

Unless otherwise stated, all translations from Pāḷi to English on this website are done by me.

[Brahmi](/buddhavacana/reference/brahmi/) script is one of the earliest scripts known to India. It came into existence in the form of stone inscriptions during the reign of Asoka, in 4th - 3rd century BCE. Buddhist scriptures inscribed in Brahmi have been found in a collection of manuscripts in caves in Bamiyan (eastern Afghanistan), Gandhara in 1993-95. These are among the earliest surviving Buddhist scriptures that have been discovered.

This website documents my journey reading and studying Buddhist texts, from the Pāḷi Canon (Tipiṭaka) and other texts, but also from various books and articles on Buddhism. It also currently contains some Pāḷi learning resources, such as my Pāḷi dictionary and textbook. Lately I have also started to include Sanskrit texts from a wider corpus. My knowledge of Sanskrit is not as strong as my knowledge of Pāḷi, so please forgive the higher propensity for errors appearing in my Sanskrit to English translations.

This website also allows me to explore my thoughts on what the Buddha may have meant in his teachings, alternative views, and how Buddhism has developed over time. Lately, I have been exploring a larger collection of Buddhist texts and teachings from various traditions.

:::caution
I do not vouch for the truth of the contents in this website. I also do not claim that I have accurately represented the Buddha's intention or the meaning of what he taught. I may revise the content from time to time as my understanding improves.

This website is created out of a need to document my learning progress, that I can reference from time to time to refresh my understanding.

Specifically, this is not a website intended to guide or teach others. In reading this website, you acknowledge that you are interested in understanding my current perspective, and it is not a recommendation or an exhortation for you.

## The World Tipiṭaka Edition

All references to the Pāli Tipiṭaka in this website are links to the [The World Tipiṭaka Edition](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/) - “The Buddhist Era 2500 Great International Council Pāḷi Tipiṭaka, Roman Script 2005” (Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka Buddhavasse 2500).

The **World Tipiṭaka Edition** is a complete 40-volume Roman-script edition of the 25-century old teaching of the Buddhist Theravāda tradition in the Pāḷi language from the B.E. 2500 (1957) Great Internatonal Buddhist Council.

It is derived from the Chaṭṭhasaṅgīti Council Edition, the Pāḷi-language text in Burmese Script, the result of the Great International Tipiṭaka Council convened in B.E. 2500 (1957) at Yangon by 2,500 erudite Theravāda Buddhist monks from all over the world.

There was initially a website version of the The World Tipiṭaka Edition that was sadly decommissioned, but fortunately an archive of the contents was preserved as a [Github repository](https://github.com/yuttadhammo/World-Tipitaka) by [Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu](https://yuttadhammo.sirimangalo.org/). I have converted this archive into a modern website in 2025 and it can now be accessed [here](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/).

## Who Am I?

![Chris Tham, photo taken at Nan Tien Temple in 2014](../../assets/images/about-me.jpeg)

My name is Chris Tham. I discovered Buddhism in my early teens, whilst visiting Singapore during a school vacation. An uncle took us to a Buddhist temple, and afterwards gave me a book called **"What Buddhists Believe"** by *Dr K Sri Dhammananda*. I read the whole book overnight and it all made sense to me, so I informally became a Buddhist after that.

Much later on, I stumbled upon another book called **"The Buddha's Explanation of the Universe"** by *C.P. Ranasinghe* which purports to explain in greater explain "Life, the Universe, and Everything" from a Buddhist perspective. These were taken from the Abhidhamma section of the Tipiṭaka. I wanted to study the original texts directly but at that time translations to English were not easily available. For years, I asked anyone who was visiting India or Sri Lanka to buy me books on the Abhidhamma and over the years I have a collected a few works but never the discourses themselves.

I have spent the last several years learning Pāḷi and are now finally able to read the Pāḷi canon and translate them into English. I have created a brand new translation of selections from the Tipiṭaka now available on [tidipa.github.io](https://tidipa.github.io).
