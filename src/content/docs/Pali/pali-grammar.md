  Pali Grammar dictionary for GoldenDict and MDict based on Digital Pali Dictionary
---

I have created a standalone dictionary of Pali grammatical inflections with grammatical symbols, usage, meaning and construction, based on the [Digital Pali Dictionary](https://dpdict.net/) ([Documentation](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io)). It generates inflection symbols corresponding to the symbols used in my [Pali Textbook](buddhavacana/pali-textbook/0-index/).

There are two versions of the dictionary available for download: GoldenDict and MDict. The latest version of the dictionaries can be found [here](https://github.com/ChristineTham/pali_grammar/releases/latest)
