This section contains various notes on learning Pāli. I attended Bhante Sujato's Pāli course held on 1 August 2023 till 31 October 2023, and then continued by John Kelly from 7 November till February 2024. The textbook used for the course was A.K. Warder's **Introduction to Pali** 3rd edition, Pali Text Society, Oxford (2001)
