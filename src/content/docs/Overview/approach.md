Is there a way to "rediscover" the original intent and teachings of the Buddha, or are we doomed to wait for the "next" Buddha, who may not appear for thousands of years?

In the pages of this website, I hope to document my journey towards my quest to truly understand what the Buddha really taught, and use that as a basis for my own "salvation", or freedom from suffering and craving.

At this point, a question could reasonably be asked: Isn't this a "scorched earth" approach, and ignores all the effort made by others to date? Surely I am not conceited enough to believe I am superior to all present and past teachers, that I am going to discover something that existing research have not already uncovered?

Indeed, it is a good question and one I have asked myself many times. I don't believe I am superior to others, and acknowledge many seem to have far more knowledge and experience than myself. There is an extensive amount of research and translations available today, and yes I have read some of them. Indeed, in preparing this article, I feel I am "standing on the shoulders of giants" and very much relying on the expertise of many people: Walpoul Rahula, Richard Gombrich, Grzegorz Polak, Mark Allon, Johannes Bronkhorst, Bhikkhu Anālayo, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Bhante Sujato amongst others to name a few.

Why not just rely on their authority, and also the experience of many well known Buddhist practitioners today? That would be nice, except they don't all agree with each other. Even prominent Buddhist bhikkhus and teachers don't always share the same views, and it is all too easy to find disagreements and debates in various discussion forums on the Internet. And since none of them have declared that they have attained enlightenment (indeed, by Vinaya rules they are not allowed to), then it is impossible to determine who is right and who is ... well ... less right.

Therefore, I believe it is still valuable to go through this process of rediscovery, mainly because for me to truly realise what the Buddha taught, I need to be able to digest, conceptualise and synthesise what I have read in my own terms.

An excerpt from the Foreword of Sujato's book [**A History of Mindfulness**](http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf) may help clarify my motivation. Note, I have paraphrased the excerpt to make it more applicable to my situation, my replacements are in parentheses:

>An aspiring (student) first learns from the lips of a teacher whose words as they utter them must be the very latest formulation of the topic. Then they might go back to read some of the works of well-known contemporary teachers. Since devotees usually have faith that their teacher (or the teacher’s teacher) was enlightened, they assume, often without reflection, that the teachings must be in accord with the Buddha. Finally, if they are really dedicated, they may go back to read (the actual teachings). Once they come to the text itself, they are already pre-programmed to read the text in a certain way. It takes guts to question one’s teachers; and it takes not just guts, but time and effort to question intelligently.

And therefore the approach:

>Our first step must be to forget all we’ve learnt about (the Buddha's teachings), and to start again from the bottom up. A basic principle of the historical method is that simpler teachings tend to be earlier and hence are likely to be more authentic​ - w​e must start with the bricks before we can build a house. It is the shorter, more basic, passages that are the most fundamental presentation of (the Buddha's teachings). The longer texts are an elaboration. We do not assume that shorter is always earlier, but we take this as a guiding principle whose implications we can follow through.

Polak further clarifies in [**Reexamining Jhana: Towards a Critical Reconstruction of Early Buddhist Soteriology**](https://www.academia.edu/34093551/Reexamining_Jhana_Towards_a_Critical_Reconstruction_of_Early_Buddhist_Soteriology) p. 216:

>Similarly to Sujato, I too believe that proper justification and motivation for critical studies of early Buddhism can only be provided by a pragmatic and existential  approach.
>
>... Buddhism easily stands out as probably  the least dogmatic and the least difficult to harmonize with the scientific worldview. It  possesses some apparent flaws, a dose of internal discrepancies, some question marks  and we can also encounter some problems connected to its history. These problems  certainly would put Buddhism on the edge of being immediately disqualified as the ‘ultimate solution’, were it not for a fascinating perspective of some deeply hidden  nucleus, possibly devoid of these flaws. This perspective is provided by the presence  of some fundamental internal discrepancies within the Buddhist doctrine, which  suggest that some process of evolution of the original doctrine must have occurred,  during which the above-mentioned discrepancies made their way into the Buddhist  writings. In this way, a critical research of this problem becomes a life’s necessity. It  is no longer the case of us trying to find motivation and then justification for this  activity, as the questions ‘why should we?’, and ‘do we have right to?’ get transformed  to ‘how can we allow ourselves not to?’.

The Buddha himself advocated that his disciples should not to accept any teaching merely on a teacher’s authority, but to work things out for themselves and use common sense in [**Kesamuttisutta** AN 3.65 PTS 1.189–1.193](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65):

>4.1 ... `mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu,　mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.`
> ... don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’

## Assumptions

* First of all, I assume that at least *some* of Buddha's teachings have been accurately preserved in the Tipiṭaka, otherwise there is no hope of rediscovering what they were. This is in accordance with the main conclusions from the book [**The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts**](https://wiswo.org/books/auth/).
* I also have to assume that at one stage the teachings must have been effective, otherwise Buddhism as a religion would have failed a long time ago and we will not know of it today.
* The Buddha was not omniscient, even after enlightenment. Although he no doubt had a penetrating intellect and a compassionate personality, he is not able to foretell the future, read people's minds (although he shown to be a good judge of character and understands people well). He does occasionally make mistakes, so we should not assume that he is always correct or his teaching is necessarily the absolute truth.
* Therefore, I assume that Buddhism is no longer effective because the teachings have been corrupted and misinterpreted, but if we can rediscover what the original teachings may have been, then they will be effective.
* I also believe that the original teachings are completely integrated and self-consistent, so the key to rediscovering Buddha's teachings is to find an internally coherent and interlocking subset.
* The core teachings of Buddhism should not require a belief in supernatural powers, the different planes of existence, various deities, etc. I am not saying that these do not exist, but the Buddha made it clear that his teachings were sufficient and don't require speculation on concepts or entities that are unknowable. We also don't really need to know the details of Buddha's life, or past lives, entertaining though they may be. So we can set aside any elements from teachings that reference these, and save them for bedtime reading.

## Principles

* Question and evaluate everything: do not assume a teaching is correct unless it appears to make sense, or can be directly experienced, and is consistent with other teachings that have been previously validated as true.
* It is possible to apply rational or logical thinking to evaluate the suttas. It does not necessarily require leaps of faith.
* The simplest possible version of a teaching is likely to be the correct one, or at least the least corrupted. It appears that the tendency is for the suttas to be added to rather than redacted, since the monks that preserved them were keen not to eliminate any of Buddha's teachings, but apparently believe enhancing them through pericopes (filling out a teaching with stock phrases) is acceptable. If two teachings differ because one appears to be a superset of the other, accept the smaller teaching as a hypothesis for the correct set. The larger set is assumed to be due to a later addition.
* Minimum viable proposition: the teachings of the Buddha should be distilled to a core, internally consistent, set which is deemed to be just sufficient to achieve enlightenment. The Tipiṭaka has a lot of repetitions and redundancy, these can be simplified.
* All teachings must be evaluated. Do not selectively cherry pick some teachings and disregard others. It is tempting to focus only on the well known and popular suttas, but it is possible some of the more esoteric or difficult to interpret suttas may be more accurate.
* Where possible, evaluate the teaching based on the Pāli text and not an English translation. In particular, retain the Pāli words for any technical terms.
* Reject any teachings not related to the core soteriology. In particular, anything to do with the various heavens and hells, deities, supernatural powers or attainments, etc. This is a fairly innocuous principle to follow regardless whether one believes in supernatural powers or not, since if one manages to achieve enlightenment, then any supernatural powers that may be gained are irrelevant anyway. In [**Susimaparibbājakasutta** SN 12.70 PTS 2.120–2.128](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.70) reaching enlightenment is described as being possible without the acquisition of psychic powers (`anekavihitaṁ iddhividhaṁ`), divine clairaudience (`dibbāya sotadhātuyā visuddhāya`), read minds, recall past lives (`anekavihitaṁ pubbenivāsaṁ anussaratha`), claivoyance (`dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena`), or even the formless meditative practices.
* Set aside any teachings relating to Buddhism as a religion - rules and prohibitions, customs, sociology etc. Many of these are probably late additions or irrelevant to soteriology.

In addition, Johannes Bronkhorst proposes a method to arrive at the teaching of the Buddha on the basis of the early canonical texts in **Early Buddhist Meditation**, a paper presented at the conference “Buddhist Meditation from Ancient India to Modern Asia”, Jogye Order International Conference Hall, Seoul, 29 November 2012:

>Put very briefly, the teaching of the Buddha as presented in the early canon contains a number of contradictions. There are views and practices that are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected. The method I have proposed is based on a study of other religious movements that are known to have existed at the time of the Buddha in the same region of India. It turns out that among the views and practices that are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon many are also found in those other religious movements. We are therefore entitled to suspect that Buddhism, in the course of its development but before the final redaction of its early canon, underwent the influence of those movements and borrowed some of their views and practices. My proposal is to consider views and practices in the Buddhist canon as borrowings, and therefore as non-authentic, if two criteria are met: (1) they are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon, and (2) they have their place in the other religious movements of the time. I also submit that the original teaching of the Buddha may have to be looked for among the views and practices that remain after deduction of the borrowings.

Even more importantly, the Buddha himself advised an approach to determine whether a teaching is authentic or not, which he repeated four times in *`Catumahāpadesakathā`* (the four great references) from [**Mahāparinibbānasutta** DN 16 PTS 2.72–2.168](https://suttacentral.net/dn16):

>4.8.1 `“Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṁ vadeyya:`
>“Take a bhikkhu who says:
>4.8.2 `‘sammukhā metaṁ, āvuso, bhagavato sutaṁ sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ,`
>Friend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
>4.8.3 `ayaṁ dhammo ayaṁ vinayo idaṁ satthusāsanan’ti.`
>this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’
>4.8.4 `Tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno bhāsitaṁ neva abhinanditabbaṁ nappaṭikkositabbaṁ.`
>You should neither approve nor dismiss that bhikkhu's statement.
>4.8.5 `Anabhinanditvā appaṭikkositvā tāni padabyañjanāni sādhukaṁ uggahetvā sutte osāretabbāni, vinaye sandassetabbāni.`
>Instead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.
>4.8.6 `Tāni ce sutte osāriyamānāni vinaye sandassiyamānāni na ceva sutte osaranti, na ca vinaye sandissanti, niṭṭhamettha gantabbaṁ:`
>If they do not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:
>4.8.7 `‘addhā idaṁ na ceva tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ;`
>‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha.
>4.8.8 `imassa ca bhikkhuno duggahitan’ti.`
>It has been incorrectly memorized by that bhikkhu.’
>4.8.9 `Iti hetaṁ, bhikkhave, chaḍḍeyyātha.`
>And so you should reject it.
>4.8.10 `Tāni ce sutte osāriyamānāni vinaye sandassiyamānāni sutte ceva osaranti, vinaye ca sandissanti, niṭṭhamettha gantabbaṁ:`
>If they do fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:
>4.8.11 `‘addhā idaṁ tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ;`
>‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha.
>4.8.12 `imassa ca bhikkhuno suggahitan’ti.`
>It has been correctly memorized by that bhikkhu.’

## Process

How to begin?

Sujato created a hypothesis on the origin and development of the Buddhist texts called *‘General Integrated Sutta Theory’* (GIST) in the book [**A History of Mindfulness**](http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf) p. 19. It "... encompasses the entire gamut of extant early scriptures, that is, the Suttas, Vinayas, and Abhidhammas of all the schools preserved in Pali, Chinese, and various Indic dialects" and presents essential relations between these texts. According to this, the following constitute the earliest strata of Buddhist texts:

* Earliest Discourses: Dhammacakkappavattana, Anattalakkhaṇa, and Ādittapariyāya Suttas, and the Request of Brahmā.
* Earliest Collection: Congruent sections of Saṁyutta Nikāya/Saṁyukta Āgama.
* Earliest Abhidhamma: Congruent sections of Vibhaṅga/Dharmaskandha/Śāriputrābhidharma.

According this, we should start by examining the earliest discourses as well as the Saṁyutta Nikāya. I will only examine the Pali version, since I can read Pali but not Chinese. Sujato suggests that the topics in the Saṁyutta Nikāya are fairly congruent across the various schools and are expositions of the Four Noble Truths, with the following relationships between the topics, the collection in the [**Saṁyuttanikāya**
SN](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn), the section in the [**Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga** Vb](https://suttacentral.net/vb), and finally individual suttas:

There is also a classification of the Buddha's teachings into 9 sections (`navaṅga`). These nine categories are based on content, structure or literary style:

1. `Sutta` (`Sūtra`[S]): prose discourses, especially short declarative discourses. Refers primarily to the early portions of the Thera/Therīgāthā and the Sutta Nipāta
2. `Geyya` (`Geya`[S]): mixed prose and verse discourse. Identified with the Sagāthāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya
3. `Veyyakarana` (`Vyākarana`[S]): explanation, analysis. Discourses in question and answer format.
4. `Gāthā`: verse
5. `Udāna`: inspired speech. Eg, Dhammapāda and the Udāna
6. `Itivuttaka` (`Ityukta`[S]): fables, eg. Itivuttaka
7. `Jātaka`: story of a previous life of the Buddha
8. `Abbhutadhamma` (`Abhutadharma`[S]): concerning wonders and miraculous events, eg. Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta (MN 123/MA 32), the Bakkula Sutta (MN 124/MA 34)
9. `Vedalla` (`Vaipulya`[S]) either 'extended discourses' or 'those giving joy' (cf Mahayana Texts) eg. MN 43/MA 211, MN 44/MA 44

According to this classification, the suttas in the four Nikāyas can usually be classified into the top 3:

| | Sutta | Vyākaraṇa | Geyya |
| --- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Content | Basic doctrinal statements | Detailed exposition | Inspirational/devotional |
| Style | Declarative prose | Interrogative prose | Mixed prose and verse |
| Speaker | The Buddha only | The Buddha and/or disciples | The Buddha, disciples, and others |
| Context | Always monastic | Usually monastic | Usually with lay people or deities, often Brahmanical |
| Paradigm | Dhammacakkappavattana | Anattalakkhaṇa | Request of Brahmā |

Based on the above, we will focus on `Sutta` and `Vyākaraṇa` discourses in the Nikāyas
in the following order:

1. [Saṁyutta Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked) (SN)
2. [Majjhima Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/middle) (MN)
3. [Dīgha Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/long) (DN)
4. [Aṅguttara Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/numbered) (AN)

We will set aside the discourses outside the four main collections for the time being. Joy Manné proposes in [**Categories Of Sutta In The Pali Nikayas And Their Implications For Our Appreciation Of The Buddhist Teaching And Literature**](https://palitextsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JPTS_1990_XV.pdf), Journal of the Pali Text Society, XV, 29-87, that “each of the first four Nikāyas came about in order to serve a distinct need and purpose in the growing and developing Buddhist community” (p. 73).
> DN was primarily intended for the purpose of propaganda, to attract converts to the new religion, and thus is aimed mainly at non-Buddhists favourably disposed to Buddhism; MN, in contrast, was directed inwards towards the Buddhist community and its purpose was to extol the Master (both as a real person and as an archetype) and to integrate monks into the community and the practice.

Bhikkhu Bodhi hypothesises in [**The Connected Discourses of the Buddha**](https://wisdomexperience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Three-Turnings-Lesson-2-Reading-2.pdf) p. 32 that:

> ... the suttas in SN (as also in AN) were, as a general rule, not targetted at outsiders or even at the newly converted, but were intended principally for those who had already turned for refuge to the Dhamma and were deeply immersed in its study and practice.
> ...
> SN was compiled to serve as the repository for the many short but pithy suttas disclosing the Buddha’s radical insights into the nature of reality and his unique path to spiritual emancipation.

We notice, particularly in [SN](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked) but generally across all the collections, is there is a pattern in the way suttas are organised in a collection. As noticed by Mark Allon in p. 27, suttas in a collection are grouped:

>... on the basis of genre, size, purpose, a numerical principle, subject matter, and so on. The textual units within these larger collections were further organized into more manageable sub-divisions, such as vagga/vargas, saṃyutta/saṃyuktas, and nipātas, and then, in the case of sutra collections, into the most basic grouping of the vagga/varga that consists ideally of ten sutras, the number ten perhaps being influenced by the fact that we have ten fingers. The larger collection was also sometimes divided into bhāṇavāras, or recitation sections, where a bhāṇavāra is said to consist of 8,000 akṣaras or syllables.47 Yet another system of organization occasionally used for large collections was to arrange the member sutras into groups of 50, or paññāsakas, a system used to group the 152 suttas of the Majjhima- nikāya into three paññāsakas48 and for structuring the suttas of the large Khandha- and Saḷāyatana-saṃyuttas of the Saṃyutta-nikāya and those in Books 2 to 10 (Duka- to Dasaka-nipāta) of the Aṅguttara-nikāya. A further set of organizational principles was then used to guide the inclusion and arrangement of textual units within these secondary and tertiary divisions. This included genre, size, whether verse was included and how many verses were involved, subject matter, a numerical feature, a connection based on a key word or words, or key concepts, the manner of treating a topic, including its treatment in brief and in expanded form, the individuals involved, such as who delivered the discourse or spoke the verses or the one to whom they were addressed, the location of events depicted, and figures of speech such as a simile or metaphor, to mention only the main ones.

In SN, suttas are often arranged by:

* topic (subject matter or keyword),
* groups of individuals, eg. deities, kings, monks, ascetics,
* a shared literary feature or figure of speech,
* pairs of textual units or occasionally longer runs


Finally, after reading and the suttas, one should internally understanding the true meaning and underlying key concepts, after which the suttas themselves do not need to be memorised or even retained in their current form. I try to summarise `buddhavacana` on this website through diagrams and tables, and very rarely translate or quote entire suttas. This is based on advice from the Buddha himself in the Simile of the Raft, contained in [**Alagaddūpamasutta** MN 22](https://suttacentral.net/mn22)
