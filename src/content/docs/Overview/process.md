How to begin?

Sujato created a hypothesis on the origin and development of the Buddhist texts called *‘General Integrated Sutta Theory’* (GIST) in the book [**A History of Mindfulness**](http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf) p. 19. It "... encompasses the entire gamut of extant early scriptures, that is, the Suttas, Vinayas, and Abhidhammas of all the schools preserved in Pali, Chinese, and various Indic dialects" and presents essential relations between these texts. According to this, the following constitute the earliest strata of Buddhist texts:

* Earliest Discourses: Dhammacakkappavattana, Anattalakkhaṇa, and Ādittapariyāya Suttas, and the Request of Brahmā.
* Earliest Collection: Congruent sections of Saṁyutta Nikāya/Saṁyukta Āgama.
* Earliest Abhidhamma: Congruent sections of Vibhaṅga/Dharmaskandha/Śāriputrābhidharma.

According this, we should start by examining the earliest discourses as well as the Saṁyutta Nikāya. I will only examine the Pali version, since I can read Pali but not Chinese. Sujato suggests that the topics in the Saṁyutta Nikāya are fairly congruent across the various schools and are expositions of the Four Realisations, with the following relationships between the topics, the collection in the [**Saṁyuttanikāya**
SN](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn), the section in the [**Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga** Vb](https://suttacentral.net/vb), and finally individual suttas:

There is also a classification of the Buddha's teachings into 9 sections (`navaṅga`). These nine categories are based on content, structure or literary style:

1. `Sutta` (`Sūtra`[S]): prose discourses, especially short declarative discourses. Refers primarily to the early portions of the Thera/Therīgāthā and the Sutta Nipāta
2. `Geyya` (`Geya`[S]): mixed prose and verse discourse. Identified with the Sagāthāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya
3. `Veyyakarana` (`Vyākarana`[S]): explanation, analysis. Discourses in question and answer format.
4. `Gāthā`: verse
5. `Udāna`: inspired speech. Eg, Dhammapāda and the Udāna
6. `Itivuttaka` (`Ityukta`[S]): fables, eg. Itivuttaka
7. `Jātaka`: story of a previous life of the Buddha
8. `Abbhutadhamma` (`Abhutadharma`[S]): concerning wonders and miraculous events, eg. Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta (MN 123/MA 32), the Bakkula Sutta (MN 124/MA 34)
9. `Vedalla` (`Vaipulya`[S]) either 'extended discourses' or 'those giving joy' (cf Mahayana Texts) eg. MN 43/MA 211, MN 44/MA 44

According to this classification, the suttas in the four Nikāyas can usually be classified into the top 3:

| | Sutta | Vyākaraṇa | Geyya |
| --- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Content | Basic doctrinal statements | Detailed exposition | Inspirational/devotional |
| Style | Declarative prose | Interrogative prose | Mixed prose and verse |
| Speaker | The Buddha only | The Buddha and/or disciples | The Buddha, disciples, and others |
| Context | Always monastic | Usually monastic | Usually with lay people or deities, often Brahmanical |
| Paradigm | Dhammacakkappavattana | Anattalakkhaṇa | Request of Brahmā |

Based on the above, we will focus on `Sutta` and `Vyākaraṇa` discourses in the Nikāyas
in the following order:

1. [Saṁyutta Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked) (SN)
2. [Majjhima Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/middle) (MN)
3. [Dīgha Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/long) (DN)
4. [Aṅguttara Nikāya](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/numbered) (AN)

We will set aside the discourses outside the four main collections for the time being. Joy Manné proposes in [**Categories Of Sutta In The Pali Nikayas And Their Implications For Our Appreciation Of The Buddhist Teaching And Literature**](https://palitextsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JPTS_1990_XV.pdf), Journal of the Pali Text Society, XV, 29-87, that “each of the first four Nikāyas came about in order to serve a distinct need and purpose in the growing and developing Buddhist community” (p. 73).
> DN was primarily intended for the purpose of propaganda, to attract converts to the new religion, and thus is aimed mainly at non-Buddhists favourably disposed to Buddhism; MN, in contrast, was directed inwards towards the Buddhist community and its purpose was to extol the Master (both as a real person and as an archetype) and to integrate monks into the community and the practice.

Bhikkhu Bodhi hypothesises in [**The Connected Discourses of the Buddha**](https://wisdomexperience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Three-Turnings-Lesson-2-Reading-2.pdf) p. 32 that:

> ... the suttas in SN (as also in AN) were, as a general rule, not targetted at outsiders or even at the newly converted, but were intended principally for those who had already turned for refuge to the Dhamma and were deeply immersed in its study and practice.
> ...
> SN was compiled to serve as the repository for the many short but pithy suttas disclosing the Buddha’s radical insights into the nature of reality and his unique path to spiritual emancipation.

We notice, particularly in [SN](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked) but generally across all the collections, is there is a pattern in the way suttas are organised in a collection. As noticed by Mark Allon in p. 27, suttas in a collection are grouped:

>... on the basis of genre, size, purpose, a numerical principle, subject matter, and so on. The textual units within these larger collections were further organized into more manageable sub-divisions, such as vagga/vargas, saṃyutta/saṃyuktas, and nipātas, and then, in the case of sutra collections, into the most basic grouping of the vagga/varga that consists ideally of ten sutras, the number ten perhaps being influenced by the fact that we have ten fingers. The larger collection was also sometimes divided into bhāṇavāras, or recitation sections, where a bhāṇavāra is said to consist of 8,000 akṣaras or syllables. Yet another system of organization occasionally used for large collections was to arrange the member sutras into groups of 50, or paññāsakas, a system used to group the 152 suttas of the Majjhima- nikāya into three paññāsakas and for structuring the suttas of the large Khandha- and Saḷāyatana-saṃyuttas of the Saṃyutta-nikāya and those in Books 2 to 10 (Duka- to Dasaka-nipāta) of the Aṅguttara-nikāya. A further set of organizational principles was then used to guide the inclusion and arrangement of textual units within these secondary and tertiary divisions. This included genre, size, whether verse was included and how many verses were involved, subject matter, a numerical feature, a connection based on a key word or words, or key concepts, the manner of treating a topic, including its treatment in brief and in expanded form, the individuals involved, such as who delivered the discourse or spoke the verses or the one to whom they were addressed, the location of events depicted, and figures of speech such as a simile or metaphor, to mention only the main ones.

In SN, suttas are often arranged by:

* topic (subject matter or keyword),
* groups of individuals, eg. deities, kings, monks, ascetics,
* a shared literary feature or figure of speech,
* pairs of textual units or occasionally longer runs

Finally, after reading and the suttas, one should internally understanding the true meaning and underlying key concepts, after which the suttas themselves do not need to be memorised or even retained in their current form. I try to summarise `buddhavacana` on this website through diagrams and tables, and very rarely translate or quote entire suttas. This is based on advice from the Buddha himself in the Simile of the Raft, contained in [9M/3.2 Alagaddūpamasutta](https://tipitaka2500.github.io/tipitaka/9M/3/3.2.html)
