I started learning the language in earnest on 30 June 2023. This is my conceited attempt at thinking I can author my own Pali textbook, based on what I have learnt so far.\nMotivation Why write my own book when there are so many excellent textbooks already on Pali?\nThe first, and best answer, is that I don’t learn until I am able to explain it to someone else, even if that someone else is an imaginary reader. There is nothing more conducive to solidifying knowledge than to have to distill it and explain it in language a “golden retriever can understand” (to paraphrase a line from the film Margin Call).\nSecondly, I find other Pali textbooks, particularly the ones written by English (or European) linguists confusing and somewhat frustrating. They use highly technical linguistic terms, which I don’t understand well. Their grammatical explanations can often be over complicated and obtuse. I am not saying every book is like this, there are many examples of books that appear to be clearly written. Perhaps the one who is obtuse is me.\nI find I learn a language best “natively”, ie. by its own terms and gradually “bootstrapping” myself until I achieve a minimum viable level of competency to start reading text. As children, this is how we learn a language, by osmosis from hearing others, until we are confident enough to form our own words. We then improve by reading, which broadens our knowledge and proficiency further.\nThere are no native speakers of Pali, but fortunately there are books describing the Pali language written by ancient Pali speakers. The earliest, and probably most well known is the Kaccāyana Pali Vyākaraṇam. This was probably written in the 5th-6th century CE, and the author has been ascribed to the Arahat Mahākaccāyana.\nThere are, of course, other Pali grammars, including those written by Moggalāna (circa 11-12 AD), Saddanīti (circa 1157 AD) and Rūpasiddhi (circa 13 AD). However, to avoid confusion from multiple sources, I have decided to primarily derive my textbook from Kaccāyana. Also, there is an excellent translation of Kaccāyana into English (which I am heavily reliant on) by A. Thitzana which can be downloaded for free from Kaccāyana Pāli Grammar Volumes 1 - 2.\nIn authoring this textbook, I have decided to avoid using linguistic technical terms as much as possible (such as conjugation, declension, nominative, etc.) but use “ordinary” English words to describe elements of the Pali language. I will use Pali terminology to describe aspects of the Pali language as much as I can, and only resort to English to describe what they mean.\nSo you will find my textbook do not use the same terms as you will find in other Pali textbooks and grammar books. I apologise in advance if this leads to confusion and frustration. I will attempt to point out the equivalent terms used in other textbooks whenever possible, to help readers in drawing comparisons if they wish.\nAgain, I do so because I feel strongly that it is best to learn Pali on it’s own terms, and not impose an external linguistic framework on it. Such frameworks may be useful to linguists, but they tend to confuse beginners like me.\nGoal and Structure The aim of this textbook is to get the reader to a level where they can tackle the texts in the Tipiṭaka (the Three Baskets of the Buddhist canon) as quickly as possible. Less emphasis is placed on the ability to listen, speak or write.\nMost Pali textbooks gently introduce the various features of the language over a number of chapters, so significant progress needs to be made before a reader is able to understand moderately complex sentences, let alone entire suttas from the Tipiṭaka. For example, A.K. Warder’s “Introduction to Pali” covers the basics of Pali grammar over 16 lessons. Assuming a reader will cover 1-2 lessons per week, this means a reader is not ready to read the Tipiṭaka until 2-4 months later.\nBy contrast, this textbook gives an overview of all the essential features of the Pali language in the first chapter, so the reader in theory should have the key knowledge to read the Tipiṭaka in days, or weeks, rather than months, or years.\nI am speaking from experience. I started studying Pali in late June, and by mid July I was already starting to read my first sutta.\nHow is this achieved? All the complex production rules with regards to sandhi and word endings are moved to appendices. The goal is to enable the reader to be able to read Pali, not necessarily to be able to write or speak it. So the reader can study the production rules based on their own needs and priority rather than being forced to apply them from the beginning.\nAlso, unlike other textbooks, this textbook does not focus on teaching vocabulary, nor does it require the reader to memorise long lists of words. Vocabulary is introduced only when necessary, and just before it is required. The reader is encouraged to develop their own vocabulary based on the material they choose to read, and therefore they only need to learn the words that are important to them.\nAfter the initial overview of the Pali language, the textbook alternates from diving deeper into aspects of the Pali language, to exercises involving reading, understanding and translating extracts from the Tipiṭaka. The reader is encouraged not to necessarily follow the textbook linearly but tackle chapters in their own order of preference, or to embark on their own reading journey and read whatever parts of the Tipiṭaka they wish to, using the textbook merely as a reference and light guidance.\nPrerequisites This textbook does not require prior familiarity with either the Pali language or the Buddhist Pali canon. It does, however, require the reader to have a strong interest in both and willing to focus their efforts in learning.\nKnowledge of multiple languages (including computer languages) and prior experience in learning a foreign language can be advantageous, but not required.\nThis textbook takes advantage of modern technology. It is not written in paper but available as hyperlinked pages on a website. It also assumes the reader has access to and is familiar with modern tools such as the Digital Pali Dictionary or the online version of The Pali Text Society’s Pali-English Dictionary so the reader can easily look up any words they are encountering for the first time.\nIn particular, the Digital Pali Dictionary can look up words in inflected form and has advanced features like sandhi splitting and compound word deconstruction, which further reduces the need to learn how to do those.\nFinally, the textbook also assumes the reader is familiar with electronic editions of the Tipiṭaka, including:\nSuttaCentral SuttaCentral contains early Buddhist texts, known as the Tipiṭaka or “Three Baskets”. This is a large collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha or his earliest disciples, who were teaching in India around 2500 years ago. They are regarded as sacred canon in all schools of Buddhism.

Note Every writer’s style is influenced by their background and personal interests. My interests in music and photography have influenced my approach to structuring this textbook. In particular, I think of constructing Pali word endings as similar to music composition, applying the rules of harmony and I refer to the noun genders as “major” and “minor”. I also have a tendency to shift viewpoints and zoom in and out of specific topics much like a photographer would. I do apologise if you are not used to my way of thinking.\nFamiliarity with software development and even a cursory knowledge of computer languages will also be advantageous. I believe computer literacy should be regarded as a fundamental aspect of basic literacy, and the ability to “program” or “code” is as important as reading, writing, and ‘rithmetic.\nHaving said that, even prior exposure to writing web pages or the most basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is probably enough of an advantage. I use a notation similar to functional programming to label word endings, and sometimes illustrate a sentence’s meaning using pseudo UML diagrams. Even if the reader has no prior experience of either, hopefully the notation should be self-evident.\nSo, without further ado, let’s begin!\nNext Chapter 1: The Pali Language Basics ","categories":["palibook"],"description":"Motivation for writing this book, the goal and structure of the book, and prerequisites for the reader\n","excerpt":"Motivation for writing this book, the goal and structure of the book, …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/intro/","tags":"","title":"0: Introduction"},{"body":"dukkham samudayo nirodho magga\ncattāri ariyasaccāni --- markmap: zoom: false pan: false --- # cattāri ariyasaccāni ## dukkham - pain - incapable of suffering ## dukkha-samudayo - origin - arising ## dukkha-nirodha - cease - suppress ## dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada - leading to - path, way This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence. netaṁ mama, nesohamasmi, na meso attāti— evametaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.\nReference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"The Four Noble Truths.\n","excerpt":"The Four Noble Truths.\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/4truths/","tags":["cattāri ariyasaccāni"],"title":"cattāri ariyasaccāni"},{"body":" Resources for Learning Pali The classical, literary language of Theravada Buddhism, with special reference to problems of indigenous orthography and phonology by Eisel Mazard (大影) LEARN PALI LANGUAGE Pali language grammar tutorials.

It thus aims to enable you to read the Buddha’s discourses in the original as quickly as possible. The textbook for the course is A New Course in Reading Pali: Entering the Word of the Buddha by James Gair and W.S. Karunatilleke (1998, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, India. ISBN 81-208-1440-1). The Pali grammatical tables were designed by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita. OCBS Courses Online Courses from the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies Pali-English Dictionary Online version of The Pali Text Society’s Pali-English dictionary Wisdom and Wonders Introduction to Pali This course, Introduction to Pali by Ajahn Brahmali, is separated into 24 parts. There are approximately 20 hours of material, including lessons and exercises. The course is intended for those who wish to read content from the Pali canon, rather than those who wish to read, write and construct terms in Pali. The course uses Introduction to Pali by A. K. Warder as the core text, and covers the first 16 chapters. Open Buddhist University: The Pāli Language: Level 1 This course doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of linguistics or classical languages, and so serves as a suitable introduction for anyone. Note that the examples will not be drawn directly from the Pāli Canon. Grammar and Prosody This section contains studies of the grammar and prosody of Buddhist texts, with original texts in Pāli and Sanskrit (together with extensive annotation). Illustrated Glossary of Pāli Terms This Glossary was originally conceived of as a way of supporting my own translations. Preparing it first of all involved gathering all instances of words in question together with their contexts. It would then usually become clear that words carried different meanings in different contexts. This was in accordance with the findings in Pāli dictionaries, which rarely consist of an explanation by a single word. The excerpts I found could then be divided into groups accordingly. Finding the correct English term for Pāli words when they are grouped on the same page turned out to be altogether easier than working with single passages or sentences and experimenting with terms in one’s head. By following this method, and sorting and resorting groups of quotes over days, months, or even years, continuously applying the find-and-replace tool, shifting backwards and forwards nearly two million words, it eventually confirmed or denied choices of my original renderings, and led to increasing confidence in my findings. Such a system of translation is only possible with computer leverage. With computers, Pāli studies have entered a new era. ","categories":"","description":"Resources for learning Pāli.\n","excerpt":"Resources for learning Pāli.\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/reference/pali/","tags":"","title":"Pāli"},{"body":" Part of “A Beginner (Non-Linguist) Guide to Learning Pali” Note In this book, references to Kaccāyana are denoted by eg. {8} (8th sutta or “grammatical rule”). Altogether there are 675 suttas, which shows how compact Kaccāyana is. Pali, like most other Indo-Aryan languages, is an oral language spoken as vākya (sentences) made up of vacana (words) which are a combination of akkhara (“sounds”, or “letters from an “alphabet”). {1}\nThere are debates about the origin of Pali, whether it was in fact a real language actually spoken by people, as opposed to an “invented” language specifically for the purposes of recording Buddhist doctrine. The term “Pali” actually just means “text”, and today “Pali” is used primarily for Buddhist literature.\nPali Alphabet and pronunciation {2}-{9} The Buddha may have spoken a language similar to Pali, and when he died his sayings were collected and systematised so they can be transmitted orally generation to generation using memorisation techniques such as chanting. The Pali canon was not written down until hundreds of years after the Buddha has passed away.\nAs such, there is no “official” Pali alphabet or writing. Pali can be transcribed fairly faithfully in a number of alphabets, including Roman letters (with the addition of a few diacritical marks or accented characters similar to other European languages).\nFor this textbook, I will use Roman letters as the basis for the Pali alphabet since I am used to that.\nOf course, no one knows for sure how Pali words would have been pronounced, and how Pali sentences would have been spoken, particularly with regards to tonality. Modern day Pali pronunciation is based on how the Buddhist Pali canon is chanted in various countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.\nReference B: The Pāli Alphabet Pali sentence structure A Pali sentence (vākya) or Pali text (pali) is generally composed of multiple words (pada or vacana). Since Pali was an oral language, punctuation mark and upper/lower case conventions are typically not used, although modern editors have sometimes added these to aid reading.\nWords also do not need to be separated by spaces, although modern Pali editions of text do add spaces, to aid reading. Later on, we will find out Pali has compound words, which consist of multiple words joined together to create a composite word.\nTo be able to distinguish words in a sentence, Pali relies heavily on paccaya (affixes to roots or word stems) to create distinctive word endings. Fluent Pali listeners will no doubt listen to the sound of these endings to distinguish the words. These endings also give additional meaning to the words and indicate how the words are used in a sentence.\nBecause of this, the word order in a Pali sentence is less important than many other languages, however there are conventions for how to arrange words in a typical sentence. Speakers can unconventionally reorder words, typically to give emphasis to certain words or to augment or add nuance to a sentence’s emotional meaning.\nThis is similar to our reaction when we hear “Yoda” speak in the “Star Wars” series of films. We appreciate who Yoda is as a personality, and we pay more attention to his words simply because of the different order.\ndhātu (roots) Fundamentally, all words in Pali are said to be derived from one or more dhātu (roots). These roots are similar to Sanskrit roots. Pali can be regarded as a simplified version of Sanskrit, however some of the roots may have different meanings, or nuances. There are some that say Sanskrit was a “sacred” language reserved for priests and members of the holy caste, whereas Pali, along with many other Indian languages, was spoken by the common people. The Buddha may have spoken in Pali because he wanted to convey his teachings to ordinary people, not just privileged members of a particular caste.\ndhātu can have 1-3 syllables:\ntype example meaning single stem or one-syllable roots vā to move yā to go pā to drink ji to conquer nī to carry su to flow bhū to be dual-word roots gamu to go paca to cook vada to speak multiple-stem or three syllable roots vāyama to attempt araha to deserve kilisa to torment A series of transformations convert a root into a word by adding paccaya (affixes). Words can also be formed by combining a root with one or more upasagga (prefixes). Multiple upasagga and different forms of paccaya can be applied to a root before it becomes a word, thus creating multi-syllabic words. The result is a word that can be used in a sentence.\nAltogether there are around 1700 roots in Pali. However, many many words can be made from them by attaching upasagga (prefixes) and various affixes (paccaya). In theory, fresh words can be formed by new combinations of roots with different prefixes so the adventurous Pali student can attempt to create Pali words for “modern” terms such as “computer” or “phone”.\nIt is not really necessary to memorise the 1700 roots, although it will be very useful if the reader chooses to do so. Knowing all the roots and the various prefixes and affixes will allow the reader to sometimes (not always) “guess” the meaning of a word not previously encountered, and will also help when applying the various transformation rules (see below).\nsandhi (word transformations) As Pali is a spoken language, when words are combined to form a sentence, changes may occur between words (or sometimes even within a word) to make the sentence “flow” or “sound” better.\nIn English, we often shorten words like “can not” to “can’t”, or “I will” to “I’ll”. This happens very frequently in Pali, especially when two vowels become adjacent to each other from two words next to each other, and there are complex rules governing how such transformations occur.\nAs a example {10} (don’t worry about the meaning of the words for now):\ntatra + ayaṁ + ādi\n= tatra + aā yaṁm + ādi\n= tatrā’ya’mādi\n= tatrāyamādi\nAs you can see, when there are two adjacent vowels when we join two or more words together, sandhi typically involves deleting one of the vowels, and then either retaining, lengthening or changing the remaining vowel. Sometimes the consonant next to the vowel may also be changed.\nThe overall effect is to make the words easier to say as a group. Although tatrāyamādi may seem like a single word because of sandhi, a listener should still regard them as separate words when trying to understand a sentence. However, some sandhi combinations of common words are so often encountered they have acquired distinctive meaning as combined words.\nAnother example {11}\ntatra + abhiratiṁ + iccheyya\n= tatra + aā bhiratiṁm + iccheyya\n= tatrā’bhirati’miccheyya\n= tatrābhiratimiccheyya\n“… should prefer enjoying at that …”\nFor the time being, we are not going to go into detail on these rules but be aware that words may change in a sentence. Eventually, as you read more and more sentences in Pali, these changes will become easier to recognise.\nReference For a summary of the rules, please refer to E: sandhi Rules {12}-{51} nāmā (nouns) {52} nāmā are the most common type of words in Pali, and roughly (but not exactly) correspond to the term “noun” in English. nāmā also means “name”, so these words represent things that we can “name” - including people, places, things, numbers, feelings and many other objects or concepts.\nExample {53} Here is a simple sentence, consisting of 3 nāma:\neso no satthā\nwhich translates as:\nthat person/being / our / teacher\nThat person [is] our teacher.\nInstead of satthā other examples may be:\nbrahmā (God) attā (self) sakhā (friend) rājā (King) liṅga (gender) {53} nāma can be classified into 3 different types or liṅga. The word liṅga actually means “gender”, and traditionally each nāma is assigned a gender. The liṅga represents an “intrinsic property” of the nāma.\nThe notion of a Pali gender is similar to (but not quite the same as) genders in some European languages. However, there are differences that it’s best to regard liṅga as a classification scheme or grammatical construct rather than what we may think of as “gender”. I like to think of it this way:\npulliṅga - the “major” or “default” type. Most nouns fall into this category. Generally associated with masculinity or masculine persons (but not always) napuṁsakaliṅga - the “special” type. Tend to be used for nouns that don’t quite fit with the notions of masculinity or feminity, or represent abstract concepts. itthiliṅga - the “minor” type, comparatively rare with respect to the other two types. Generally associated with feminity or feminine persons. Note that for the remainder of this book, we may refer to the above liṅga by the following symbols for brevity:\n🚹 = pulliṅga 🚻 = napuṁsakaliṅga 🚺 = itthiliṅga Ancient India was a patriarchal society, and men were regarded as the “major” component of society, doing activities considered important, hence the tendency is to associate important words to pulliṅga.\nNumber Like in English, Pali words are slightly different depending on whether they are used to refer to one thing vs many things.\n👤 = ekavacana (singular) 👥 = bahuvacana (plural) There used to be also a “dual” form but that is now largely obsolete and encountered in very rare instances. Examples include:\nto idh’āgato (these two having come) ubho (both) mātāpitu (father and mother) vibhatti (case endings) {54} Unlike English, words need to be “transformed” before they are used in a sentence. This is done by adding endings or “suffixes” to the word (vibhatti).\nAltogether there are seven types of vibhatti, and they are conveniently numbered 1 to 7 {55}:\nsymbol 👤 👥 vibhatti 1️⃣ si yo paṭhamā (“first”) 2️⃣ aṁ yo dutiyā (“second”) 3️⃣ nā hi tatiyā (“third”) 4️⃣ sa naṁ catutthī (“fourth”) 5️⃣ smā hi pañcamī (“fifth”) 6️⃣ sa naṁ chaṭṭhī (“sixth”) 7️⃣ smiṁ su sattamī (“seventh”) You may note the 4th and 6th case endings are the same, which means in practice we can only tell which case is being used by context (more later). Notice also the plural endings for some of the cases are the same. Again, which case is being used can only be determined by context.\nLet’s start with an example. Suppose we have the word 🚹purisa (“man”) and we want to use it in a sentence in singular form, and we wish to transform it using the 1st case ending (paṭhamāvibhatti). If we look up the above table, we should add the si ending:\npurisa + si → puriso\nWait, what happened? Why does the transformation not result in purisasi?\nThis is where additional rules comes into play. By rule of {83}, any word ending in a will be transformed into the 1st case by deleting the a and by rule of {104} replacing the si with o. Kaccāyana has a whole chapter of such rules.\nSo the transformation becomes:\npurisa + si\n→ purisa + si {83}\n→ puris + si(o) {104}\n→ puriso\nThe plural form undergoes a similar transformation:\npurisa + yo\n→ purisa + si {83}\n→ puris + yo(ā) {107}\n→ purisā\nThis does make things interesting, because the transformation result for every word then depends on:\nkāra’nta (word ending) liṅga (gender) ekavacana (singular) vs. bahuvacana (plural) vibhatti (desired case ending) Here is a table of purisa transformed in all the 7 cases and singular vs plural.\nnumber vibhatti ending transformation sutta result 👤 1️⃣ si purisa + sio {104} puriso 👥 1️⃣ yo purisa + yoā {107} purisā 👤 2️⃣ aṁ purisa + aṁ purisaṁ 👥 2️⃣ yo purisa + yoe {107} purise 👤 3️⃣ nā purisa + ena {103} purisena 👥 3️⃣ hi purisae + hi {101} purisehi 👥 3️⃣ hi purisae + bhi {99}-{101} purisebhi 👤 4️⃣ sa purisa + ssa {61} purisassa 👥 4️⃣ naṁ purisaā + naṁ {89} purisānaṁ 👤 5️⃣ smā purisa + smā purisasmā 👤 5️⃣ smā purisa + mhā {99} purisamhā 👤 5️⃣ smā purisaā {108} purisā 👥 5️⃣ hi purisae + hi {101} purisehi 👥 5️⃣ hi purisae + bhi {99}-{101} purisebhi 👤 6️⃣ sa purisa + ssa {61} purisassa 👥 6️⃣ naṁ purisaā + naṁ {89} purisānaṁ 👤 7️⃣ smiṁ purisa + smiṁ purisasmiṁ 👤 7️⃣ smiṁ purisa + mhi {99} purisamhi 👤 7️⃣ smiṁ purisae {108} purise 👥 7️⃣ su purisae + su {101} purisesu You will note that in some of the cases, there are multiple ways the word can be transformed. For example, singular purisa can be transformed in the 3rd case into either purisehi or purisebhi. Both are acceptable. Which should we use for a given sentence? It depends on the “sound” - a native speaker would have chosen the version that sounded the most pleasing, depending on surrounding words.\nThe rules can be quite complicated, so let’s not worry about them for now. In practice, you can rely on looking up a relevant table to determine the appropriate transformation (TBD). If you are just reading Pali, then with practice you will learn to recognise the various endings which will become familiar to you.\nReference A summary of the rules is provided in G: vibhatti Rules A much more important question to answer at this point is …\nWhy do we need vibhatti endings and what is their purpose? In English, when we see a sentence like\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nWe know that words “quick” and “brown” refers to the “fox”, which is the “subject” of the sentence, and “lazy” refers to the dog, which is the “object” of the sentence. The verb “jumped over” separates the subject and the object. Our brain automatically “collects” and “groups” the words, so we read the sentence as:\n(The quick brown fox) jumped over (the lazy dog).\nIn English, as we can see, word order is important. If we mixed the words up, the sentence becomes far harder to read:\nOver the quick lazy brown fox the dog jumped.\nThis sentence would imply quite a different meaning.\nIn Pali, all words with the same gender and the same case ending should be grouped together, and that’s how we distinguish which words belong to which entity. So the word order becomes far less important, we could mix the words up and the sentence would still have the same meaning!\nIn practice, the 1st case is usually reserved for the “most important” entity in a sentence, the 2nd for the “second most important” and so on.\nSo, in the above English sentence, were it to be translated the Pali, “the quick brown fox” would all be in the 1st case, and “the lazy dog” would all be in the 2nd case. If there are more entities, they would take the 3rd, 4th cases and so on.\nIn many sentences, the 1st case would usually refer to the entity or actor “performing” or “doing” the action (or, the “subject” of the sentence), and the 2nd case refers to the entity being impacted by the action (the “object”) of the sentence. Although this is a very common pattern, it is by no means rigid, and in theory any case ending can be used for any purpose. There are many examples in the Pali canon where the cases are used in unconventional ways. (TBD: need to include examples)\nVibhatti usage typical meanings {271}-{315} The following meanings are usually associated with each case. However, as noted above, these are conventions only, and the author of a sentence may choose to adopt an unconventional approach of assigning words to cases (perhaps for emphatic or stylistic reasons).\nvibhatti number role usage Pali term sutta 1️⃣ 👤/👥 subject (active) subject, doer kattu/kattā {284} 1️⃣ 👤/👥 address to address, to call ālapana {285} 2️⃣ 👤 to (object) object kamma {297} 2️⃣ 👥 till continuity for a certain period or distance accantasaṁyoga {298} 3️⃣ 👤 by (subject) (passive) subject kattu/kattā {288} 3️⃣ 👥 by/with supporting cause karaṇa {286} 3️⃣ 👥 with/together company sahayoga {287} 3️⃣ 👥 by means of/in regard of aspect or adjective visesana {292} 3️⃣ 👥 due to/for reason kāraṇa {289} 4️⃣ 👤/👥 receivership/purpose recipient of action sampadāna {293} 5️⃣ 👤 from source from which it occurs apādāna {295} 5️⃣ 👥 for/due to reason kāraṇa {296} 6️⃣ 👤 (possessive) of owner sāmi {301} 6️⃣ 👥 among/out of selection for comparison niddhāraṇa {304} 6️⃣ 👥 while/despite two concurrent actions anādara {305} 7️⃣ 👤 at, in, on location/position adhikaraṇa/okāsa {302} 7️⃣ 👥 among/out of selection for comparison niddhāraṇa {304} 7️⃣ 👥 for/due to cause nimitta {310} 7️⃣ 👥 while/when two concurrent actions lakkhaṇa {313} 7️⃣ 👥 despite/while two concurrent actions anādara {305} Reference For a detailed explanation of the various meanings associated with each case ending, please refer to the next chapter:\n2: kāraka (word ending) meanings {271}-{315}\nNote You may find in Pali grammar books written in English the following nomenclature for the cases:\n1️⃣ = “nominative” 2️⃣ = “accusative” 3️⃣ = “instrumental” 4️⃣ = “dative” 5️⃣ = “ablative” 6️⃣ = “genitive” 7️⃣ = “locative” Note that these terms only partially reflect the possible meanings and roles associated with each case, so I would discourage using these terms. They can lead to confusion. However, these terms are common in Pali-English dictionaries so I encourage you to substitute the case number when you see these terms.\n0️⃣ ālapana (vocative) {57} English Pali textbooks often refer to a “vocative” case, but this is not recognised as a separate case but a variant of the 1st case. The usual case ending si (for 1st case singular) is instead called ga but the transformation rules are similar to si.\nExamples:\nbhoti ayye! (Oh madam!)\nbhoti kaññe! (Oh girl!)\nbhoti kharādiye! (Oh the girl named Kharādiya!)\nContrast this to the normal 1st case form of ayyā (🚺👤1️⃣):\nsā ayyā (that lady)\nIn plural:\nbhotiyo ayyāyo (Oh Madams!)\nsabbanāma (pronouns) sabba means “all” so sabbanāma are “common” or “generic” nouns that can apply in “all’ situations.\nExamples of sabbanāma include the different vibhatti forms of ya (“who, what”), ta (“he/she/it”, “that”), eta (“this”), ima (“this”), amu (“that”), kiṁ (“what?”). One of the common usage of sabbanāma is as “pronouns”, where they can assume all genders to represent all things and persons of the different genders. But they can also function as adjectives, adverbs, honorifics and interrogatives.\nExamples:\nSabbanāma meaning 4️⃣ 6️⃣ sabba all sabbesaṁ sabbesānaṁ ya which yesaṁ yesānaṁ ta that tesaṁ tesānaṁ ima this imesaṁ imesānaṁ ka who kesaṁ kesānaṁ itara other itaresaṁ (others) itaresānaṁ (others) katama what katamesaṁ (of which ones) katamesānaṁ (of which ones) ⏏️ nipāta (particles) nipāta means “to fall. i.e. to be placed anywhere”, and refer to words that can be found placed in the beginning, in the middle or at the end of sentences and words, but not usually regarded as prefixes (see below).\nGenerally, the vibhatti endings of nipāta words are elided as these words are not related to other words in the sentence and therefore do not need to be matched with them. {221}\nHowever, in some instances, the vibhatti endings may be retained, if the nipāta word play a role in the sentence meaning.\nExamples tvaṁ panā’vuso! tumhe panā’vuso!\nyou / (no specific meaning) / friend\nyou (plural) / (no specific meaning) / friend\nHow about you, my friend? And the rest of you (plural)?\npadaso dhammaṁ vāceyya\nby word / dhamma / teach (causative, optative)\n(He) should teach and say Dhamma word by word.\nvihāraṁ • sve upagaccheyya\nto temple / tomorrow / should approach (optative)\n(He) should come to the temple tomorrow.\nThe following is a brief descriptive list of some nipāta words. Some are plain nipātas without any affix, while some are with indeclinable affixes. Some may even have a sort of vibhatti-ending in them or may still have traces of vibhattis. Please note that the implied meaning of elided vibhatti still remains in effect for some nipāta words such as yathā, tathā and evaṁ etc.\nnipāta meaning note yathā, tathā in a manner that, in such a way as combination of sabbanāma ya ta with indeclinable affix thā. The affix itself is ex- pressive of manner or mood. evaṁ thus, in this way, true as it is said, yes (many meanings) dutiyāvibhatti, very frequently used in Pāli texts khalu used mostly in a reported narrative kho mostly meaningless, but sometimes it may mean “only, really” a plain nipāta, found often in main Buddhist texts. Used together with atha evaṁ taṁ etc. tatra there a combination of sabbanāma ta with indeclinable affix tra atho in addition, besides atha now, then, later on, if Sometimes used in the beginning of a chapter or an episode, as an introductory or initiating word hi really, for, only Sometimes a meaningless particle tu in addition, only Also an expletive without meaning, sometimes added to be more emphatic in a statement ca also, too It is used to express some additional meaning in grammatical texts. Sometimes meaningless. Sometimes it has a lot of meanings when used after other nipāta particles vā similar to either or, in other ways In grammatical texts, sometimes it is used to express other option or method or inconsistency of a function. Sometimes with no particular meaning vo you It is sometimes a meaningless expletive haṁ, ahaṁ I the use of these two nipāta are seldom found in texts unless it means “I” alaṁ (a) enough, (b) suitable, (c) worthiness, (d) appropriateness, (e) ability Also, (f) sometimes used as a prohibition or rejection, usually used in combination with (1) a noun in instrumental case, or (2) tuṁ-infinitive Kita verbs or (3) an āya-infinitive in dative case nouns eva equal to “only” used next to the word it want to modify or restrict or confirm in its implied meaning. A plain nipāta. ho!, aho! these are expression of interjection or surprise. No vibhatti he!, ahe!, re!, are! “hey” Vocative nipāta particles, similar to “hey” in English. Usually vocative case vibhatti is applicable, but to be elided nipāta as prefixes However, there are quite a few nipāta that can be placed before some verbs or kita-affixed nouns and used in a way resembling prefixes.\ncombined nipāta word combined meaning antaradhāyati antara dhāyati (he) disappears āvikaroti āvi karoti (he) makes it openly, displays clearly pātubhavati pātu bhavati (it) arises visibly, i.e. appears sacchikaroti sacchi karoti (he) realizes, i.e. attains vinābhāvo vinā bhāvo separation, being apart sahacārī saha cārī the one who used be together, a friend punabbhavo puna bhavo being born again, rebirth 🔼 upasagga (prefixes) There are 20 upasagga words which are usually applied as prefixes to ākhyāta (verbs) and kita-affixed nouns (see below). Like nipāta, upasagga words also have their vibhatti endings elided, but in some cases where they are functioning as independent words (not attached to a verb or noun), they may retain their vibhatti endings.\nThere are three kinds of upasagga:\ndhātva’tthā’nuvattaka - those that follow the meaning of the root, without affecting its original meaning. dhātva’tthabādhaka - those that absolutely mean opposite of the root. These categorically change the original meaning of the root. dhātva’tthavisesaka - those that enhance the original meaning of the root by adding more specific meaning and flavour to it. Example:\nparābhavo\n🔼(parā) 🚹👤1️⃣(bhava)\nopposite / to be, being loss, ruin\nHere are various words that can be formed from the word hara (“carrying”) together with various upasagga prefixes and the ṇa-suffix:\nexample upasagga meaning combined meaning pahāro pa specially carrying (instruments of harm) specially, i.e. beating, striking nihāro ni out taking out, evicting nīhāro nī out taking out, evicting (same as above) uhāro u up carrying up duhāro du bad carrying badly saṁhāro saṁ well carrying well vihāro vi specially carrying one’s body specially, staying, i.e. act of staying at a place using alternating bodily modes avahāro ava lowly,contemptuous, mean carrying in a mean manner, i.e. stealing anuhāro anu following, subsequent carrying accordingly parihāro pari all around carrying from all around adhihāro adhi specially, nicely carrying nicely abhihāro abhi toward carrying toward patihāro pati again carrying again suhāro su well carrying well āhāro ā toward carrying toward, food or meal atihāro ati beyond, excessive carrying beyond or excessively apihāro api downward carrying down apahāro api out carrying outward, i.e. removing upahāro upa near, close to carrying toward proximity, bringing up closer, carrying complementary gift etc. Reference For a listing of the detailed meanings that are associated with upasagga, please refer to F: upasagga meanings 🆎 samāsa (compound nouns) {316}-{343} Like German, Pali often combines many nouns to form a compound noun.\nThe following table summarises the major types of compound nouns, typical liṅga (gender) and examples:\ntype name liṅga example rule abyayībhāva Adverbial 🚻 so napuṁsakaliṅgo {320} kammadhāraya Appositional variable, or follow last component abhidheyavacano, paraliṅgo ca {341} digu Numeral Appositional 🚻 (usually 👤 but can be 👥) digusseʼkattaṁ {321} tappurisa Determinative variable ayañʼca tappuriso abhidheyavacanaliṅgo Rūpasiddhi {351} dvanda Copulative Mostly 🚻 but variable in some instances per last component samāhāre napuṁsakaṁ Moggalāna {20} Chapter 3 bahubbīhi Attributive variable per the contextual meaning of the aññapada (the external word of attributive meaning) bahubbīhi cāʼyaṁ abhidheyaliṅgavacano Rūpasiddhi {352} The rules for constructing a samāsa can be complex:\nrāja + putta (the King’s son)\n→ rāja + sa + putta (👤6️⃣)\n→ rāja + sa + putta + si (👤1️⃣)\n→ rāja(ññ) + sa(o) + putta + si {135}\n→ rāñño + putta + si(o) {83}\n→ rāñño + putto\n→ rāñño(ja) + putto(a) {317}\n→ rājaputta {318}\n→ rājaputta + si (👤1️⃣)\n→ rājaputta + si(o) {104}\n→ rājaputta + o {83}\n→ rājaputto\nFortunately, resources such as the Digital Pali Dictionary can deconstruct compound words into their individual words, which helps the beginner to understand such words encountered. So there is less of a need to learn the complex rules associated with them.\n➡️ taddhita (affixes) {344}-{405} Various affixes can be added to a noun to create derived nouns and adjectives.\nCompare and contrast with English use of affixes such as “-al”, “-ly”, “-er”, “-or” etc. For example, “topic” vs “topical”, “true” vs “truly”.\nIn English, “navigate” is a verb, whereas “navigator” (with an “-or” affix) is a profession. Similarly, in Pali, nāvā is “boat”, nāvā with ṇika as an affix becomes nāviko (“traveller by boat”, or “sailor”). Note that the last vowel of the root and the ṇ are both elided, and then the noun is given the 🚹👤1️⃣ vibhatti ending.\nThe rules for constructing a tadhitta affixed noun can be rather daunting:\nvasiṭṭha + apacca (Vasiṭṭha’s son)\n→ vasiṭṭha + sa (👤6️⃣) + apacca\n→ vasiṭṭha + s + sa + apacca {61}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + si (👤1️⃣)\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + si(aṁ) {219}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + aṁ {83}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apaccaṁ (of Vasiṭṭha / son)\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + ṇa + apaccaṁ {344}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + ṇa + apaccaṁ {317}\n→ vasiṭṭha + ṇa {396}\n→ vasiṭṭha + a {318}\n→ va(ā)siṭṭha + a {400}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + a {83}\n→ vāsiṭṭha {601}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + si (👤1️⃣)\n→ vāsiṭṭha + si(o) {104}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + o {83}\n→ vāsiṭṭho\ntype name affix rule liṅga notes apacca patronymic ṇa {344} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇāyana, ṇāna {345} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇeya {346} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇi {347} 🚹 ṇika by vā of {347} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇava {348} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇera {349} 🚹 (but can be variable) Aneʼkattha various meanings ṇika {350}-{351} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇa {352} 🚹 (but can be variable) ima, iya {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) ima, iya, ika by ādi of {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) kiya by ca of {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) samūha collective grouping kaṇ, ṇa {354} 🚹 tā {355} 🚺 taʼdassathāna the source or the cause iya {356} 🚻 (but can be variable) upamā analogous similitude āyitatta {357} 🚻 tanʼnissitattha dependent nature and source la {358} 🚻 (mostly) bahula prominent nature ālu {359} variable ka is added sometimes. eg. dayāluko bhāva abstract conditions ṇya, tta {360} 🚻 ttana by tu of {340} 🚻 tā {360} 🚺 ṇa {361} 🚻 visesa comparisons tara, tama, isika, iya, iṭṭha {363} variable taʼdassaʼtthi possessed quality or inherent nature vī {364} 🚹 (but can be variable) so by ca of {364} 🚹 (but can be variable) sī {365} 🚹 (but can be variable) ika, ī {366} 🚹 (but can be variable) ra {367} 🚹 (but can be variable) vantu {368} 🚹 (but can be variable) mantu {369} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇa {370} 🚹 (but can be variable) tappakati made up of something maya {372} variable Words with taddhita affixes are sometimes not recognised by Pali-English dictionaries, since these dictionaries may not cover the full range of possible affixes and their meanings.

This is so prevalent other grammar books such as Moggalāṇa Vyākaraṇa and Rūpasiddhi created rules to accomodate them.\nVoices Like Sanskrit, Pali supports 3 different ways of expressing sentences, based on the “voice”:\nthe active voice (kattu) {444}-{452} the passive voice (kamma) the impersonal voice (bhāva) However, in Pali literature, bhāva (middle, or impersonal, voice) is seldom used, probably because most of the literature is based on the Buddha (or a disciple) “speaking” to a group of monks, which has then been transformed into a structure suitable for memorisation and chanting.\n🔴 Passive verb endings Vattamānā Vibhatti {440}-{443} A passive verb is created by using the attanopada (🔵) endings together with an infix of ya in between the root and the ending.\nNote that passive verbs can only be formed based on roots that can be expressed in a “passive” (kamma) sense - some roots can only result into “active” verbs and cannot be transformed this way.\nExample transformation (based on the root paca (to cook)):\npaca + ya + te {440}\n→ paca + y(cc)a + te {441}\n→ paccate (“is cooked”)\nThe full set of attanopada (🔵) endings of in the present tense vattamāna (▶️) across the 3 persons and plurality:\nvoice number person tense ending transformation result 🔴 🤟 👤 ▶️ te paca + y(cc)a + te paccate 🔴 🤟 👥 ▶️ ante paca + y(cc)a + ante paccante 🔴 🤘 👤 ▶️ se paca + y(cc)a + se paccase 🔴 🤘 👥 ▶️ vhe paca + y(cc)a + vhe paccavhe 🔴 👆 👤 ▶️ e pacca + y(cc)a + e pacce 🔴 👆 👥 ▶️ mhe paccca + y(cc)a + ā + mhe paccāmhe Because the middle voice is seldom used, rule {518} allows these verbs to be retransformed into “reversed” parassapada (🟢) endings:\nvoice number person tense ending transformation result 🔴 🤟 👤 ▶️ ti paccate + ti paccati 🔴 🤟 👥 ▶️ anti paccante + anti paccanti 🔴 🤘 👤 ▶️ si paccase + si paccasi 🔴 🤘 👥 ▶️ tha paccavhe + tha paccatha 🔴 👆 👤 ▶️ mi pacce + ā + mi paccāmi 🔴 👆 👥 ▶️ ma paccāmhe + ā + ma paccāma Typically we would use the parassapada (🟢) endings for passive verbs.\nOther examples (using different rules):\nkara (“to do”)\n→ kara + ya + te {440}\n→ kara + ī + ya + te {442}\n→ kara + ī + ya + te {521}\n→ karīyate (“is done”)\nvaḍha (“to grow”)\n→ vaḍha + ya + te {440}\n→ vaḍha + ya(ḍḍha) + te {443}\n→ vuḍḍhate (“is grown”)\n🟠 Causative verbs There are two types of causative verbs:\nCausative verb in the active voice Causative verb in the passive voice There 4 typical causative affixes (kārita) used to construct causative verbs {438}:\nṇe ṇaya ṇāpe ṇāpaya Just like for tadhikka noun affixes, the ṇ is typically elided when joined to a root, leaving the remaining letters. {523}\nVarious vowel gradation transformations may also take place when joining the affix to the noun as per rule {483}.\nExample transformation (based on the root paca (to cook)) and the causative affix ṇe:\npaca + ṇe + ti {438}\npaca + ṇe + ti {521}\n→ pac + ṇe + ti {523}\n→ pa(ā)c + e + ti {483}\n→ pāceti (\"(he) causes to cook”)\n🟠 Causative (active) verbs {438} The full set of causative versions of the vattamāna (▶️) forms of the root paca (to cook) using parassapada (🟢) endings:\nvoice number person tense ending causative transformation result irregular forms 🟠 🤟 👤 ▶️ ti ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + ti pāceti 🟠 🤟 👤 ▶️ ti ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + ti pācayati 🟠 🤟 👤 ▶️ ti ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + ti pācāpeti pacāpeti 🟠 🤟 👤 ▶️ ti ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + ti pācāpayati pacāpayati 🟠 🤟 👥 ▶️ anti ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + anti pācenti 🟠 🤟 👥 ▶️ anti ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + anti pācayanti 🟠 🤟 👥 ▶️ anti ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + anti pācāpenti pacāpenti 🟠 🤟 👥 ▶️ anti ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + anti pācāpayanti pacāpayanti 🟠 🤘 👤 ▶️ si ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + si pācesi 🟠 🤘 👤 ▶️ si ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + si pācayasi 🟠 🤘 👤 ▶️ si ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + si pācāpesi pacāpesi 🟠 🤘 👤 ▶️ si ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + si pācāpayasi pacāpayasi 🟠 🤘 👥 ▶️ tha ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + tha pācetha 🟠 🤘 👥 ▶️ tha ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + tha pācayatha 🟠 🤘 👥 ▶️ tha ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + tha pācāpetha pacāpetha 🟠 🤘 👥 ▶️ tha ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + tha pācāpayatha pacāpayatha 🟠 👆 👤 ▶️ mi ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + mi pācemi 🟠 👆 👤 ▶️ mi ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + mi pācayami 🟠 👆 👤 ▶️ mi ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + mi pācāpemi pacāpemi 🟠 👆 👤 ▶️ mi ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + mi pācāpayami pacāpayāmi 🟠 👆 👥 ▶️ ma ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + ma pācema 🟠 👆 👥 ▶️ ma ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + ma pācayama 🟠 👆 👥 ▶️ ma ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + ma pācāpema pacāpema 🟠 👆 👥 ▶️ ma ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + ma pācāpayama pacāpayāma Note: not all forms of the above are encountered in Pali literature - they represent the full theoretical set of causative forms that can be generated.\n🟠🔴 Causative passive verbs It is also possible to construct causative verbs in the passive voice, just by adding the passive ya affix after the causative affix.

Like kāraka (the syntax of case or vibhatti endings), sādhana affixed words can be associated with specific usage meanings.\nsādhana-affixed word can be associated with a voice (kattu, kamma, bhāva), in which case their usage can affect the “voice” of a sentence. This is especially true when sādhana-affixed word is used as a verb-noun, ie. it carries the “action” of a sentence.\nExample sentences of kattu sādhana-affixed words dānaṁ dinno devadatto\n🚻👤2️⃣(dānaṁ) 🚹👤1️⃣(⏬(ta)(dinno) devadatto)\nalms / gave (past participle) / Devadatta\nDevadatta gave alms.\nkumaro antepuraṁ gato\n🚻👤2️⃣(antepuraṁ) 🚹👤1️⃣(kumaro ⏬(ta)(gato))\nKing’s palace / prince / went (past participle)\nThe prince went into the King’s palace.\nso bhagavā sayam’pi cattāri saccāni buddho\n🚹👤1️⃣(so bhagavā ⏬(ta)(buddho)) ⏏️(sayam api) 🚻👥2️⃣(cattāri saccāni)\nthat / Bhagavā / understood (past participle) / by oneself / just / four / truths\nThat Bhagavā (Buddha) understood the four truths just by himself.\nExample sentences of kamma sādhana-affixed words buddhena dhammo desito\n🚹👤3️⃣(buddhena) 🚹👤1️⃣(dhammo ⏬(ta)(desito))\nby Buddha / dhamma / taught (past participle)\nThe Dhamma is taught by the Buddha.\nbhotabbo odano bhavatā\n🚹👤1️⃣(⏬(tabba)(bhotabbo) odano) 🚹👤3️⃣(bhavatā)\neaten (future passive participle) / rice / Your Honourable\nThat rice is to be eaten by Your Honourable.\nExample sentences of bhāva sādhana-affixed words tassa gītaṁ\n🚻👤6️⃣(tassa) 🚻👤1️⃣(🔽(ta)(gītaṁ))\nof that person / sung (past participle)\nSung of that person.\nsayitabbaṁ bhavatā\n🚻👤1️⃣(⏬(tabba)(sayitabbaṁ)) 🚹👤3️⃣(bhavatā)\neating (future passive particle) / by Your Honourable\nEating by Your Honourable.\nsādhana associated meanings and usage The associated meanings are rather weak compared to case endings (vibhatti) and can sometimes have no significant role.\nassociation example meaning rule usage kattu nāyako the leader (who leads) {527} netī’ti nāyako kamma kammaṁ work (which is being done) {531} karīyate tan’ti kammaṁ bhāva cāgo generosity (act of giving, sharing) {529} cajate, cajanaṁ vā cāgo karaṇa vinayo the discipline (by which one is trained) {527} vineti etenā’ti vinayo sampadāna dānīyo the recipient monk (to which alms should be given) databbo assā’ti dānīyo apādāna bhemo the fearsome object (from which people fear) {627} bhāyanti etasmā’ti bhemo adhikaraṇa ṭhānaṁ the place (where people stand) {548} tiṭṭhanti tasmin’ti Exercise Our first exercise, and also a celebration for finishing this chapter, is to translate the Saraṇattaya Kp 1 PTS 1. This is a very well known sutta commonly referred to as the Three Jewels (also known as the Triple Gem or Three Refuges) and traditionally recited by disciples of the Buddha as part of a ceremony by which one formally declares oneself a Buddhist.\nBuddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nSaṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nLet’s start by examining only the first line. Analysing each word by identifying the form of the vibhatti ending yields:\n🚹👤2️⃣(buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ) 🟢👤🤟▶️(gacchāmi)\nNote The notation used here is inspired by functional programming conventions. In mathematics, we refer to \\(f(x)\\) as the function \\(f\\) applying on the variable \\(x\\), so 🚹👤2️⃣(x) means all words in x are in the 2nd case, singular (ekavacana) and pulliṅga in gender. Similarly, 🟢👤🤟▶️(y) means all words in y are present indicative (vattamāna) active (parassapada) verbs in the singular (ekavacana), “first person” (in English, “third person”) form (paṭhama purisa). Translating each word into English yields:\nBuddha / refuge / (I) go\nNote that in Pali, all words in the same case refer to the same entity, so both “Buddha” and “refuge” refer to the same entity. In other words, the Buddha is the refuge and the refuge is the Buddha. In English, we can regard the equality as “Buddha as refuge”.\nSo, rearranging the words into a more idiomatic English sentence, we get:\nI go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the exercise, translate the remainder of the sutta. It’s okay to leave words like “dhamma” and “sangha” untranslated (and use non-accented characters) as these are well known terms to Buddhists.\nAnswer I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nI go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nI go to the Sangha as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\nNote that dutiyaṃ and tatiyaṃ are being used as nipāta. piis a nipāta meaning “too” or “also”.\nThe sentence structure of this sutta can also be represented as a pseudo UML class diagram:\nclassDiagram class sentence[\"dutiyampi/tatiyampi buddhaṃ/dhammaṃ/saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi\"] { \u003c\u003cvākya\u003e\u003e english((For the second/third time) I go to the Buddha/Dhamma/Sangha as refuge) } namespace saṅkhyāpūraṇa { class dutiyaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 2️⃣ english(second time) } class tatiyaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 2️⃣ english(third time) } } class pi { \u003c\u003cnipāta\u003e\u003e english(too) } namespace saraṇa { class buddhaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹👤2️⃣ } class dhammaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹👤2️⃣ } class saṅghaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹👤2️⃣ } } class saraṇaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹👤2️⃣ english(as refuge) } class gacchāmi { \u003c\u003cākhyāta\u003e\u003e 🟢👤🤟▶️ english(I go) } sentence *-- dutiyaṃ sentence *-- tatiyaṃ sentence *-- pi sentence *-- buddhaṃ : kamma sentence *-- dhammaṃ : kamma sentence *-- saṅghaṃ : kamma sentence *-- saraṇaṃ : kamma sentence *-- gacchāmi: kiriya buddhaṃ .. saraṇaṃ dhammaṃ .. saraṇaṃ saṅghaṃ .. saraṇaṃ We can also model the successive actions as a pseudo UML sequence diagram:\nsequenceDiagram participant ahaṃ as (ahaṃ) participant buddhaṃ participant dhammaṃ participant saṅghaṃ loop (paṭhama), dutiyampi, tatiyampi ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e buddhaṃ : gacchāmi buddhaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e dhammaṃ : gacchāmi dhammaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e saṅghaṃ : gacchāmi saṅghaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) end Finally, the different states of the refuges can be modelled as a pseudo UML state diagram:\nstateDiagram-v2 state fork_state \u003c\u003cfork\u003e\u003e state join_state \u003c\u003cjoin\u003e\u003e [*] --\u003e fork_state : gacchāmi fork_state --\u003e buddhaṃ fork_state --\u003e dhammaṃ fork_state --\u003e saṅghaṃ buddhaṃ --\u003e join_state dhammaṃ --\u003e join_state saṅghaṃ --\u003e join_state join_state --\u003e saraṇaṃ saraṇaṃ --\u003e fork_state : dutiyampi, tatiyampi Conclusion Congratulations on finishing this chapter! It is compact and dense, and not every feature of Pali explained here will sink in initially. It may be worthwhile revisiting this chapter from time to time to check your understanding as you progress in your journey in learning Pali.\nThe good news is you now know enough of the basics of Pali to start reading the Tipiṭaka with the aid of a good dictionary, and looking up every word as you go along. You may encounter sentences that you can’t interpret very well, but that’s okay. Leave it for now, and study the next chapters, which will help you build confidence and skill in your ability to analyse sentences and deduce the correct meaning.\nRemember, the sentences in the Tipiṭaka are often repetitive and used in similar forms again and again. They are intentionally structured this way to assist in memorisation and chanting. So, once you have learnt how to correctly interpret a complex sentence, you may encounter it again and again and reading will become easier and easier over time.\nNext Chapter 2: kāraka (word ending) meanings ","categories":["palibook"],"description":"A concise overview of the Pali language covering key features\n","excerpt":"A concise overview of the Pali language covering key features\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/basics/","tags":["sandhi","nāmā","liṅga","vibhatti","alapana","sabbanāma","nipāta","upasagga","samāsa","taddhita","ākhyāta","saraṇattaya","kibbidhāna","uṇādi","sādhana"],"title":"1: The Pali Language Basics"},{"body":" SuttaCentral SuttaCentral contains early Buddhist texts, known as the Tipiṭaka or “Three Baskets”.

When wishes (good wishes) are expressed dative is used for the person for whom they are expressed “may there be (hotu) long life for him” “good luck to you” bhaddaṃ bhavato hotu “welcome to you” svāgataṃ bhavato hotu svāgataṃ (“welcome!”) indeclinables sotthi “safety”, “safely” and namo (“hail!”) infinitive of verbs overlaps in meaning with the dative of purpose. idiomatic construction: proper time for something, the opportunity for something etassa kālo “it is the time for this”, “it is the right time for this” akālo … yācanāya “it is not the right time for asking” yassa dāni kālaṃ maññasi “for which you think it is now (dāni) the right time” extremely common in saying (formally) goodbye (spoken by the host, not the guest - who for his part has made the excuse of pressure of work), being roughly equivalent to “well, if you really must go … \" used also by servants reporting to their master that preparations are completed, implying “you can start whenever you wish”, etc 6. sāmivacana Genitive case:\nmay often be translated by “of”, and serves as a “possessive” case denoting the “possessor” (sāmin) the whole of which the related word denotes a part (avayava) immediately precedes the word to which it relates rañño thūpo A construction with a possessive genitive is very often equivalent to an English construction with the verb “to have” idaṃ assa hoti “of him thus it is …” (or was, etc.), “he has this thought …”, “he thinks thus …” tassa evaṃ hoti an idiom consisting of the genitive of the word denoting the period + accayena expresses the time after which (or through the passage of which) something is done: sattāhassa accayena … pabbajissāma “after I have passed away”, “after my death/parinibbāna” mama + accayena = “after me” agent-genitive (“subjective genitive”): brāhmaṇassa pūjito (Soṇadaṇḍo) “(Soṇadaṇḍo was) honoured of (= by) the priest” yesaṃ … devā …adiṭṭhā “those … who have not seen … the gods (negative participle: a-)” (“of (= by) whom the gods are unseen”; Commentary explains yesaṃ by yehi) patient-genitive (“objective genitive”): ahaṃ … tassa yaññassa yājetā “I … (was) the performer of that sacrifice” substitute for the instrumental kumbhiṃ … pūraṃ … suvaṇṇassa “pot … full … of gold” used with certain indeclinables, such as: piṭṭhito - “behind” purato - “before”, “in front of” antarena - “between” me purato - “in front of me” kāyānam antarena - “between the bodies” uttaraṃ nagarassa - “north of the city” The “genitive absolute” consists of a noun (or pronoun) followed by a participle, both inflected in the genitive. This nexus stands apart from the other words of the sentence and means “while (the noun was doing the participle)” special sense of disregarding: “despite (the noun doing the participle)”, “under their very noses,” as when the participle means “seeing”, “looking on” telassa jhāyamānassa “as (while) the oil is burning” mātāpitunnaṃ … rudantānaṃ … pabbajito “though his parents were weeping, he went forth” (i.e. “despite their weeping”) useful for constructing a sentence with two agents, but the similarly constructed locative absolute (Lesson 16) is much more frequently used 8. āmantaṇavacana, ālapanavacana Vocative:\nused “enclitically”, i.e. it does not stand at the beginning of a sentence guṇanāma Adjective:\nWhen an adjective is common to two or more nouns it may agree with the sum of these (and be plural) or with the nearest. Thirdly the qualified words may be taken as collective and singular and the adjective be singular. Where the genders conflict, the masculine takes precedence over the feminine, the neuter over both. An adjective usually precedes the noun it qualifies, but when there are several adjectives with one noun very often only one adjective precedes and the rest follow the noun. A demonstrative pronoun relating to the same noun will precede the whole group. When an adjective, or (all the) adjectives, follows its noun this usually indicates that it is being “predicated” of the noun, or in other words that the attribute in question is being emphasized. sabbanāma Pronouns\nniyamita Personal and Demonstrative (incomplete TBD)\nAlthough the person is expressed by the inflection of the verb, the pronouns of the first and second persons are frequently used, giving a slight emphasis to the subject. The third person pronoun is less often used in this way. The third personal pronoun is used also as a demonstrative, meaning “that”, “it”, in three genders. It is generally used as what is known as an “anaphoric \" pronoun, that is to say it refers back to someone or something previously mentioned in a narrative. As opposed to the use in conversation and other direct speech of “pronouns of presence” referring to someone or something present (“this man”, “that jar”), these pronouns are called “pronouns of absence” because it is most often used to speak of someone or something in a story and therefore not present to the listeners. It may serve to connect the sentences of a narrative into a continuous paragraph or longer section. It is used also as an emphatic pronoun (in combination with another pronoun or occasionally with 1st person, for example in the expression so ‘haṃ “I” (literally “that I”). In combination with a noun it is again emphatic and may sometimes be translated “the” There being no “definite article” in Pali the demonstrative pronouns are sometimes used where English would use the definite article, and may sometimes be translated “the” rather than “he”, “that”, “this”, etc. Demonstrative pronouns must agree in number and gender (and case) with the nouns to which they refer.

Some have remarked to my parents that they sense an aura of spirituality in me even when I was young, that I had what some called “an old soul.” I was not aware that I was different in any way, except I had a very strong sense of curiosity and loved learning new things and exploring places.\nMy parents were agnostic, so I was not brought up with a strong sense or awareness of religion. My mother said (many years later) she avoided taking me to visit places of worship or participate in religious ceremonies as she said someone (a monk? a soothsayer?) once told her I had a strong mind and may anger gods and deities with my presence.\nDiscovery of Buddhism When I was in my early teens, we visited Singapore and an uncle took us to a Buddhist temple. I can’t remember any details about the temple or any religious ceremony we may have attended, but my uncle gave me a book called “What Buddhists Believe” by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. Out of curiosity, I started reading the book that night and could not put it down until I finished.\nSuddenly, everything made sense to me. I had previously been exposed to Christianity and Islam, but didn’t understand why there was so much suffering and inequality in the world if there was a Creator. It did not seem fair to me that some are born rich and privileged but others seem to suffer their entire lives.\nI was also curious that often events and circumstances seemed to favour me naturally. I did well in school without trying very hard. I was popular and got along well with people. Things seem to fall into place that benefit me or propel me forward in life, and reflecting back I seem to have been gifted with good fortune for most of my life. Even setbacks often turn out to be beneficial in hindsight, painful though they may be at the time. It almost seemed unfair, as if I was somehow “cheating” and would need to pay back for it eventually.\nAt the same time, there were quite a few occasions that broke the pattern, when I did not not get what I wanted no matter how hard I wished for it. And it seemed the more I crave for it, the less likely it would occur. Over time, I’ve learnt to contain these intense disappointments, and to accept that I should not wish or desire too hard or it may never happen.\nI was already starting to ponder mortality, my own and others around me, and whether there was existence or continuation of life beyond death. I started craving and half wishing for an eternal soul, and worried that people I love will one day no longer be here, and things I love will be taken away from me. I started developing a sense of detachment and refrained from being too closely connected and perhaps loving too much.\nSo, the core concepts of Buddhism appealed greatly to me. They seemed to naturally answer all the questions I had, and the book did a great job explaining these concepts in a clear and easy to understand manner.\nBy the end of the book, I had convinced myself that I want to be a Buddhist. I remember having a long conversation with my father the day after sharing my joy and enthusiasm. I must have been quite evangelical, because I convinced him to read the book, and he also agreed with me that it made a lot of sense and we should both be Buddhists.\nSometime later, I also convinced my best friend in school, so I had a core set of people around me that were interested in Buddhism, gaining wisdom, and following the Noble Eightfold Path. However, I had no desire to join the Sangha and devote the rest of my life towards attaining nibbāna. I was not ready to renounce a normal life, and from the perspective of a teenager still in school, it did not seem like a practical choice and certainly not one that I thought my parents would approve or support.\nAdulthood My interest in Buddhism faded as I continued my life journey, and other things took priority. Finishing school, then university, getting married, working, enjoying life and sensual pleasures, doing what people normally do and what society expects me to do just seemed like the path of least resistance.\nAlthough I still remembered my interest in Buddhism, and had a desire to one day study the dhamma, and perhaps even learning Pali, I just did not have the time. Furthermore, it was difficult getting access to the Tipiṭaka, and many sections (including the Abhidhamma) have not been translated to English, and certainly not in book form.\nFor years, I would pester anyone I know visiting India or Sri Lanka to purchase Buddhism books for me, so I ended up amassing a collection that I have never read (until recently).\nMore recently, however, modern technology platforms and social media have reminded me that the Buddhist concepts of dukkha and tanhā are more relevant than ever. We are encouraged to become addicted to mindlessly consuming content that never truly satisfies, and develop wrong views about ourselves and others that result in more suffering. I became aware, with increasing dismay and horror, that technology panders to and amplifies our lowest desires and cravings. We have become obsessed with body image, what others think, giving ourselves to hedonistic pleasures, and not caring about anything other than instant gratification.\nRetirement In the last few years, I have gradually pulled myself from an active working life. I stopped working just before the COVID19 pandemic started in 2020. My original intention was to enjoy the rest of my life pursuing the things and activities that interested me, such as traveling, eating good food, watching movies, listening to music, and also indulging in my hobbies such as photography, music, art. My focus was to live each day of my life in happiness, doing the things I enjoy.\nAt the same time, I was also harbouring an ambition to make something that was meaningful. I was initially thinking of perhaps building and selling an app, and I had spent some time learning how to code and design web sites and apps.\nI was also making sure I was financially secure and able to live the rest of our lives without worrying about money or covering our living expenses. I had gradually stopped being interested in accumulating wealth or assets. In hindsight, I was slowly renouncing from worldly pleasures and cares without even realising it.\nIt occurred to me recently that perhaps it was an opportune time to resume my journey in studying dhamma. To my surprise, recent years have made core Buddhist texts much more accessible and the resources for studying them are easily obtainable.\nBoth my parents died, within months of each other, in 2021. Both of them died at peace, calm, and accepting, and without any suffering. In the last few years of their lives, they certainly seem to have progressed in their own journeys towards nibbāna and realisation. They seem more contented, happy with each other, and ridding themselves of the craving and suffering of their younger days. I like to think that perhaps both of them became Arahats moments before they died, and that they have finally unbound themselves from the endless cycle of sāmsara and reached the ultimate destination. I can only hope that I, too, can reach there before I die, and this website documents the remainder of my progress in that journey.\n","categories":"","description":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to date\n","excerpt":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/overview/journey/","tags":"","title":"My Journey along the aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/pa%C3%B1cup%C4%81d%C4%81nakkhandh%C4%81/","tags":"","title":"pañcupādānakkhandhā"},{"body":"--- markmap: zoom: false pan: false --- # pañcupādānakkhandhā ## rūpupādānakkhandho - form ## vedanupādānakkhandho - feeling ## saññupādānakkhandho - perception ## saṅkhārupādānakkhandho - choices (intentional activities) ## viññāṇupādānakkhandho - consciousness Reference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"five grasping aggregates\n","excerpt":"five grasping aggregates\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/5aggregates/","tags":["pañcupādānakkhandhā"],"title":"pañcupādānakkhandhā"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/pa%E1%B9%ADiccasamupp%C4%81da%E1%B9%81/","tags":"","title":"paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"},{"body":"stateDiagram-v2 [*] --\u003e avijjā avijjā --\u003e saṅkhārā saṅkhārā --\u003e viññāṇaṁ viññāṇaṁ --\u003e nāmarūpaṁ nāmarūpaṁ --\u003e saḷāyatanaṁ saḷāyatanaṁ --\u003e phasso phasso --\u003e vedanā vedanā --\u003e taṇhā taṇhā --\u003e upādānaṁ upādānaṁ --\u003e bhavo bhavo --\u003e jāti jāti --\u003e jarāmaraṇaṁ_sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā_sambhavanti jarāmaraṇaṁ_sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā_sambhavanti --\u003e [*] Reference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"dependent origination\n","excerpt":"dependent origination\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/pa%E1%B9%ADiccasamupp%C4%81da%E1%B9%81/","tags":["paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"],"title":"paṭiccasamuppādaṁ"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/tags/sangaha/","tags":"","title":"sangaha"},{"body":" About buddhavacana This website documents my journey reading and studying Buddhist texts, primarily from the Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka) but also supplementary books and articles.

About Me Chris Tham, photo taken at Nan Tien Temple in 2014 My name is Chris Tham. I discovered Buddhism in my early teens, whilst visiting Singapore during a school vacation. An uncle took us to a Buddhist temple, and afterwards gave me a book called \"What Buddhists Believe\" by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. I read the whole book overnight and it all made sense to me, so I informally became a Buddhist after that.\nMuch later on, I stumbled upon another book called \"The Buddha's Explanation of the Universe\" by C.P. Ranasinghe which purports to explain in greater explain \"Life, the Universe, and Everything\" from a Buddhist perspective. These were taken from the Abhidhamma section of the Tipiṭaka. I wanted to study the original texts directly but at that time translations to English were not easily available. For years, I asked anyone who was visiting India or Sri Lanka to buy me books on the Abhidhamma and over the years I have a collected a few works but never the discourses themselves.\nWith a brand new translation of the Tipiṭaka now available on SuttaCentral I can finally study the actual text of the Tipiṭaka which has resulted in the creation of this site.\nAbout this website This website is hosted on Github using Github Pages.

Some scholars have speculated that it was either Magadhi or Magadhi-Prakrit considering his family background and where he was born. The Buddha probably preached the Dhamma in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Buddhist teachings were preserved and transmitted orally, and modern scholars believe over time Pāli evolved as a mix of the above languages, with the meanings of some words adapted to have specific Buddhist significance. As such, Pāli is a partially invented language used for the transmission and preservation of Buddhist theology, and is the canonical language of Buddhism.\nI have always wanted to study Buddhism, and in particular the Pāli Canon or Tipiṭaka, in Pāli rather than translated into English.
