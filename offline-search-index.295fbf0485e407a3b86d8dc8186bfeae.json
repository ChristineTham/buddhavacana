Some have remarked to my parents that they sense an aura of spirituality in me even when I was young, that I had what some called “an old soul.” I was not aware that I was different in any way, except I had a very strong sense of curiosity and loved learning new things and exploring places.\nMy parents were agnostic, so I was not brought up with a strong sense or awareness of religion. My mother said (many years later) she avoided taking me to visit places of worship or participate in religious ceremonies as she said someone (a monk? a soothsayer?) once told her I had a strong mind and may anger gods and deities with my presence.\nDiscovery of Buddhism When I was in my early teens, we visited Singapore and an uncle took us to a Buddhist temple. I can’t remember any details about the temple or any religious ceremony we may have attended, but my uncle gave me a book called “What Buddhists Believe” by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. Out of curiosity, I started reading the book that night and could not put it down until I finished.\nSuddenly, everything made sense to me. I had previously been exposed to Christianity and Islam, but didn’t understand why there was so much suffering and inequality in the world if there was a Creator. It did not seem fair to me that some are born rich and privileged but others seem to suffer their entire lives.\nI was also curious that often events and circumstances seemed to favour me naturally. I did well in school without trying very hard. I was popular and got along well with people. Things seem to fall into place that benefit me or propel me forward in life, and reflecting back I seem to have been gifted with good fortune for most of my life. Even setbacks often turn out to be beneficial in hindsight, painful though they may be at the time. It almost seemed unfair, as if I was somehow “cheating” and would need to pay back for it eventually.\nAt the same time, there were quite a few occasions that broke the pattern, when I did not not get what I wanted no matter how hard I wished for it. And it seemed the more I crave for it, the less likely it would occur. Over time, I’ve learnt to contain these intense disappointments, and to accept that I should not wish or desire too hard or it may never happen.\nI was already starting to ponder mortality, my own and others around me, and whether there was existence or continuation of life beyond death. I started craving and half wishing for an eternal soul, and worried that people I love will one day no longer be here, and things I love will be taken away from me. I started developing a sense of detachment and refrained from being too closely connected and perhaps loving too much.\nSo, the core concepts of Buddhism appealed greatly to me. They seemed to naturally answer all the questions I had, and the book did a great job explaining these concepts in a clear and easy to understand manner.\nBy the end of the book, I had convinced myself that I want to be a Buddhist. I remember having a long conversation with my father the day after sharing my joy and enthusiasm. I must have been quite evangelical, because I convinced him to read the book, and he also agreed with me that it made a lot of sense and we should both be Buddhists.\nSometime later, I also convinced my best friend in school, so I had a core set of people around me that were interested in Buddhism, gaining wisdom, and following the Noble Eightfold Path. However, I had no desire to join the Sangha and devote the rest of my life towards attaining nibbāna. I was not ready to renounce a normal life, and from the perspective of a teenager still in school, it did not seem like a practical choice and certainly not one that I thought my parents would approve or support.\nAdulthood My interest in Buddhism faded as I continued my life journey, and other things took priority. Finishing school, then university, getting married, working, enjoying life and sensual pleasures, doing what people normally do and what society expects me to do just seemed like the path of least resistance.\nAlthough I still remembered my interest in Buddhism, and had a desire to one day study the dhamma, and perhaps even learning Pali, I just did not have the time. Furthermore, it was difficult getting access to the Tipiṭaka, and many sections (including the Abhidhamma) have not been translated to English, and certainly not in book form.\nFor years, I would pester anyone I know visiting India or Sri Lanka to purchase Buddhism books for me, so I ended up amassing a collection that I have never read (until recently).\nMore recently, however, modern technology platforms and social media have reminded me that the Buddhist concepts of dukkha and tanhā are more relevant than ever. We are encouraged to become addicted to mindlessly consuming content that never truly satisfies, and develop wrong views about ourselves and others that result in more suffering. I became aware, with increasing dismay and horror, that technology panders to and amplifies our lowest desires and cravings. We have become obsessed with body image, what others think, giving ourselves to hedonistic pleasures, and not caring about anything other than instant gratification.\nRetirement In the last few years, I have gradually pulled myself from an active working life. I stopped working just before the COVID19 pandemic started in 2020. My original intention was to enjoy the rest of my life pursuing the things and activities that interested me, such as traveling, eating good food, watching movies, listening to music, and also indulging in my hobbies such as photography, music, art. My focus was to live each day of my life in happiness, doing the things I enjoy.\nAt the same time, I was also harbouring an ambition to make something that was meaningful. I was initially thinking of perhaps building and selling an app, and I had spent some time learning how to code and design web sites and apps.\nI was also making sure I was financially secure and able to live the rest of our lives without worrying about money or covering our living expenses. I had gradually stopped being interested in accumulating wealth or assets. In hindsight, I was slowly renouncing from worldly pleasures and cares without even realising it.\nIt occurred to me recently that perhaps it was an opportune time to resume my journey in studying dhamma. To my surprise, recent years have made core Buddhist texts much more accessible and the resources for studying them are easily obtainable.\nBoth my parents died, within months of each other, in 2021. Both of them died at peace, calm, and accepting, and without any suffering. In the last few years of their lives, they certainly seem to have progressed in their own journeys towards nibbāna and realisation. They seem more contented, happy with each other, and ridding themselves of the craving and suffering of their younger days. I like to think that perhaps both of them became Arahats moments before they died, and that they have finally unbound themselves from the endless cycle of sāmsara and reached the ultimate destination. I can only hope that I, too, can reach there before I die, and this website documents the remainder of my progress in that journey.\n","categories":"","description":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to date\n","excerpt":"Brief history of how I was introduced to Buddhism and my progress to …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/overview/journey/","tags":"","title":"My Journey along the aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo"},{"body":"Context Kaccāyana is the oldest extant Pāli grammar, and was composed around the sixth century CE, most probably in India.

Some of them seem to lack clarity (primarily due to the writing style). Others don’t explain the examples well enough, and yet others are too verbose, inserting explanations not in the original text. There are some spelling errors and mistakes in the edition published on Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana Tipiṭaka, some of which have been incorporated into existing translations. I have taken the opportunity to correct the mistakes, uncovered by scholars such as O. H. Pind and A. Ruiz-Falqués. Unlike some translations, I am honouring the use of option markers in Kaccāyana, and in most cases am faithfully translating vā as “optionally”, kvaci as “occasionally” and navā as “by exception.” I am also cross referencing the use of technical terms with other classical Pāli grammars. It is a good way to further my understanding of Pāli. It is also a good opportunity for me to introduce the Brahmi script. As we know, there are no surviving Buddhist texts written in Brahmi, so there is no need to learn this script, however, I like it due to it’s elegance and simplicity. I wanted to augment the translations with diagrams, and incorporate worked through grammatical analysis and rule derivations in the examples. In comparison with the other classical Pāli grammars, Kaccāyana is brief and succinct, minimising repetition. It was used as a standard textbook for teaching Pāli in countries such as Burma for many years, and often used in various monasteries as a Pāli reference text. I prefer Kaccāyana to most English Pāli textbooks and grammar books, as it describes Pāli without the distorting lens of Western linguistics. My translation is presented using a modern responsive web design, featuring Google’s Noto Sans font.

I do not completely agree with the contents of the above books, since they represent different opinions and views of the respective authors. However, I do recommend reading them and each of them have influenced me in some way.\nThe Buddha and Buddhism I believe the Buddha was a real person (even though his social background and life details are hard to prove). He was born in Lumbini sometime in the 5th century BCE from the Gotama clan of the Shakya tribe, in present-day Nepal, and spent his life living and travelling around the Ganges Plain, near the modern Nepal–India border.\nAccording to Pāsarāsisutta MN 26 PTS 1.161–1.175, as a young man he started to question the nature of existence, of being born and subject to the negative consequences of life such as growing old, falling sick, dying, sorrow. He started to search for a path out of these consequences. He renounced and became an ascetic and followed the practices of various teachers. He eventually concluded these teachings did not lead to satisfactory answers.\nHe ultimately discovered the answers himself and attained Perfect Enlightenment (sammāsambodhi).\nOut of compassion for other living beings, he taught a way for others to achieve enlightenment. This is classified as a soteriology, or a “doctrine of salvation” so that others can follow in his footsteps and free themselves from the burden of “suffering” and “rebirth.”\nIt would appear the Buddha’s teachings were successful - thousands of people became enlightened as a result of his teachings and became arahant (enlightened beings) in his lifetime.\nThe Buddha’s teachings spread throughout much of Asia along trading routes. Even today the Buddha’s teachings is highly appealing to many people, and there has been a surge of interest in the last century or so from industrialised and developed countries.\nAlthough it originated as a philosophy and soteriology, today Buddhism is regarded as a religion (the fourth most popular in the world1, with approximately 500 million adherents).\nHowever, as a percentage of the world population, Buddhism is a declining religion, with the number of adherents expect to reduce from 7.1% of the world population in 2010 to 5.2% by 2050.\nBuddhism is a rapidly growing religion in Australia since the 1980s and now represents about 2.4% of Australia’s population2 based on the 2021 census but the growth has been primarily due to immigration.\nWhat language did the Buddha teach in? The Buddha probably taught in a variety of languages common in the Indian subcontinent at the time (both Indo-Aryan and indigeneous). These languages may or may not have included Pāli.\nIt is unclear whether Pāli is an actual language or whether it is an amalgamation or synthesis of various dialects and languages, or even whether it is a “constructed” language (like Esperanto) designed to represent his teachings and has never been spoken as an actual language of his times. Pali appears to be heavily based upon and is a simplified version of Sanskrit, and it is generally classified as a “Prakrit” (a language originally derived from Sanskrit).\nThe earliest versions of his teachings have been preserved in the Pāli language in the Tipiṭaka. It is possible that only some teachings have been preserved, and perhaps only those that were originally taught in Pāli or have been translated into Pāli.\nFor the rest of this article, Pāli words are highlighted using a monospaced font (as an example buddho meaning “the one who understood” but also “The Buddha” expressed in nominative form). In rare occasions, Sanskrit words are used, these are highlighted with a ‘[S]’ suffix (for example Ṛg Veda[S]).\nTo truly understand Buddhism, it is best to read the Tipiṭaka in Pāli. Although there are many good translations to English of most of the contents of the Tipiṭaka (with the exception of parts of the Abhidhamma), Bhikkhu Bodhi notes in the Preface to The Connected Discourses of the Buddha p. 12:\nTo attempt to translate Pāli into a modern Western language rooted in a conceptual framework far removed from the “thought world” of the ancient suttas is also bound to involve some degree of distortion. The only remedy against this, perhaps, is to recommend to the reader the study of Pāli and the reading of the material in the original. Unlike English, or even Sanskrit, Pāli is a highly specialized language with only one major sphere of application — the Buddha’s teachings — and thus its terminology is extremely precise, free from intrusive echoes from other domains of discourse. It is also rich in nuances, undertones, and conceptual interconnections that no translation can ever succeed in replicating.\nWhat did the Buddha teach? When printed, the Pali Tipiṭaka usually takes up about 45 volumes, so clearly it will be almost impossible to condense the entirety of the Buddha’s teachings into a few paragraphs.\nMost introductory books on Buddhism tend to focus on the earliest discourses, which are typically:\nPaṭhamabodhisutta Ud 1.1 PTS 1 Verse 1: which describes Buddha’s thoughts as he ‘awakened’ (achieved enlightenment). This covers an important aspect of Buddhist philosophy known as Dependent Origination. This topic is covered in further detail in: Dutiyabodhisutta Ud 1.2 PTS 2 Verse 2 Tatiyabodhisutta Ud 1.3 PTS 3 Verse 3 Paṭiccasamuppādasutta SN 12.1 PTS 2.1–2.2 Vibhaṅgasutta SN 12.2 PTS 2.3–2.4 Nagarasutta SN 12.65 PTS 2.105–2.107 Mahānidānasutta DN 15 PTS 2.55–2.71 Paṭhamauruvelasutta AN 4.21 PTS 2.20–2.21: describes the Buddha’s decision to teach what he has learnt at the request of Brahmā Sahampati. Dhammacakkappavattanasutta SN 56.11 PTS 5.421–5.424: supposedly Buddha’s first discourse, given to a group of five ascetics who were formerly his companions. This covers the middle way, the four pure truths and the eightfold path. The 4 pure truths are further explained in Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Anattalakkhaṇasutta SN 22.59 PTS 3.67–3.68: Buddha’s second discourse where he teaches the concept of no Eternal Self (anatta) with regards to the 5 masses of fuel (pañcupādānakkhandhā). Ādittapariyāyasutta SN 35.235 PTS 4.169–4.171: Buddha’s third discourse, also called the Fire Sermon, where the Buddha reflects on the inefficacy of ascetic practices and focusing on freeing from desire of the senses. This discourse is meant to be a contrast to the fire-related ritual practices stipulated by the Vedic hymns and Upaniṣads, which were the dominant religious beliefs in Buddha’s time. Some people also like the following later discourses:\nMahākhandhaka Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100: summarises events following the Buddha’s awakening, leading up to the formation of the sangha, the first monastery and the ordination of the two famous disciples Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The first three discourses of the Buddha are also embedded in this long sutta. Mettasutta Snp 1.8 PTS 26 PTS 26 Verse 143–152: popularly known the Discourse on Love, which focuses on universal goodwill. Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta MN 10 PTS 1.56–1.63: where the Buddha teaches the fundamentals of mindful meditation. Mahāparinibbānasutta DN 16 PTS 2.72–2.168: supposedly the longest discourse in the Tipiṭaka, describes the events surrounding the Buddha’s final passing away. This discourse contains a summary of many of his core teachings. Some of you may have noticed I have excluded the Dhammapada, a very popular collection of inspirational verses, from the above list. Since I am interested in getting as close as possible to understanding what the Buddha actually taught, I find the Dhammapada problematic. First of all, it is a late collection, and almost certainly composed after the Buddha died. It can also be ambiguous in meaning and intent and difficult to parse in parts. There are significant variations in the various versions of Dhammapada or it’s equivalents across the canonical collections. And finally, not all of the Dhammapada may have been Buddhist in intent, as some contents appear to be aligned with non-Buddhist text, eg. the Mahabharatha, so it seems likely the Dhammapada is a collection of verse sourced from many places, and may not always reflect the Buddha’s teachings. Von Wilhelm Rau has done an analysis of parallels between the Dhammapada and other texts, including non-Buddhist texts, in Bemerkungenund Nicht-Buddhisti-Schesanskrit-Parallelenzum Pāli-Dhammapada, from Jñānamuktāvalī, International Academy of Indian Culture, New Dehli (1963).\nThe awakening of the Buddha, plus the first three discourses, can be summarised into a single diagram:\ngraph TB subgraph cattāriariyasaccāni[cattāri ariyasaccāni] classDef truth fill:cyan dukkhaṁ(((dukkhaṁ))):::truth dukkhasamudayaṁ(((dukkhasamudayaṁ))):::truth dukkhanirodhaṁ(((dukkhanirodhaṁ))):::truth dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā(((dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā))):::truth dukkhaṁ -.-\u003e dukkhasamudayaṁ dukkhasamudayaṁ -.-\u003e dukkhanirodhaṁ dukkhanirodhaṁ -.-\u003e dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā end style cattāriariyasaccāni fill:azure subgraph ariyo_aṭṭhaṅgiko_maggo[ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo] direction LR classDef right fill:LightGreen sammādiṭṭhi([sammādiṭṭhi]):::right sammāsaṅkappo([sammāsaṅkappo]):::right sammāvācā([sammāvācā]):::right sammākammanto([sammākammanto]):::right sammāājīvo([sammāājīvo]):::right sammāvāyāmo([sammāvāyāmo]):::right sammāsati([sammāsati]):::right sammāsamādhi([sammāsamādhi]):::right sammādiṭṭhi -.- sammāsaṅkappo sammāsaṅkappo -.- sammāvācā sammāvācā -.- sammākammanto sammākammanto -.- sammāājīvo sammāājīvo -.- sammāvāyāmo sammāvāyāmo -.- sammāsati sammāsati -.- sammāsamādhi sammāsamādhi -.- sammādiṭṭhi end style ariyo_aṭṭhaṅgiko_maggo fill:PaleGreen subgraph pañcupādānakkhandhā classDef mass fill:pink saṅkhārakkhandho{{saṅkhārakkhandho}}:::mass viññāṇakkhandho{{viññāṇakkhandho}}:::mass rūpakkhandho{{rūpakkhandho}}:::mass saññākkhandho{{saññākkhandho}}:::mass vedanākkhandho{{vedanākkhandho}}:::mass end style pañcupādānakkhandhā fill:MistyRose rūpakkhandho --- nāmarūpaṁ vedanākkhandho --- vedanā saññākkhandho --- saḷāyatanaṁ saññākkhandho --- phasso saṅkhārakkhandho --- saṅkhārā viññāṇakkhandho --- viññāṇaṁ subgraph paṭiccasamuppādo avijjā\u003eavijjā] saṅkhārā\u003esaṅkhārā] viññāṇaṁ\u003eviññāṇaṁ] nāmarūpaṁ\u003enāmarūpaṁ] saḷāyatanaṁ\u003esaḷāyatanaṁ] phasso\u003ephasso] vedanā\u003evedanā] taṇhā\u003etaṇhā] upādānaṁ\u003eupādānaṁ] bhavo\u003ebhavo] jāti\u003ejāti] jarāmaraṇaṁ\u003ejarāmaraṇaṁ] avijjā --\u003e saṅkhārā saṅkhārā --\u003e viññāṇaṁ subgraph sabbaṁādittaṁ viññāṇaṁ --\u003e nāmarūpaṁ nāmarūpaṁ --\u003e viññāṇaṁ nāmarūpaṁ --\u003e saḷāyatanaṁ viññāṇaṁ --\u003e saḷāyatanaṁ saḷāyatanaṁ --\u003e phasso phasso --\u003e vedanā vedanā --\u003e taṇhā taṇhā --\u003e upādānaṁ upādānaṁ --\u003e viññāṇaṁ end style sabbaṁādittaṁ fill:LavenderBlush upādānaṁ --\u003e bhavo subgraph saṃsāra bhavo --\u003e jāti jāti --\u003e jarāmaraṇaṁ jarāmaraṇaṁ --\u003e bhavo end style saṃsāra fill:GhostWhite end style paṭiccasamuppādo fill:ivory dukkhaṁ -.-\u003e pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhasamudayaṁ -.-\u003e paṭiccasamuppādo paṭiccasamuppādo -.-\u003e dukkhanirodhaṁ dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā -.-\u003e ariyo_aṭṭhaṅgiko_maggo upādānaṁ -.-\u003e pañcupādānakkhandhā pañcupādānakkhandhā -.-\u003e dukkhaṁ pañcupādānakkhandhā -.-\u003e aniccaṁ pañcupādānakkhandhā -.-\u003e anatta aniccaṁ((aniccaṁ)) anatta((anatta)) A rather freeform interpretation of the above diagram follows:\nWe are ignorant (avijjā). Ignorant of Life, The Universe, and Everything. We start out life as new born babies, unconscious, unaware, barely perceiving our surroundings.\nBecause, or as a result of, our ignorance, we make non optimal decisions and choices (saṅkhārā). The accumulation of these decisions and choices result in an emerging consciousness (viññāṇaṁ).\nOur consciousness is “constructed” - it is created (or “caused”) by the results of all the previous choices, decisions, intentions that we’ve made in the past.\nLet’s examine how this consciousness has been constructed by exploring a cycle or chain of processes. Just like new born babies, all living things start with no awareness and no consciousness.\nBut we react to our surroundings. Even single celled organisms have receptors that are sensitive to their environment, and can detect changes in temperature, light and nutrient availability. These receptors trigger a series of signalling pathways that can cause the cell to move towards or away from certain stimuli, or change shape or behaviour.\nIn the same way, we have sense organs that perceive the environment. Gradually we are aware of forms, the form of our own body, and other forms external to the body. We build a virtual representation of forms in our mind (saññā), and name them (nāmarūpaṁ). By “naming” forms, we conceptualise them and develop symbolic “tokens” of them (and through this, our grasp of language develops). Awareness of our own form give rise to consciousness, and similarly consciousness makes us aware of that which is us, and that which is not us. Hence viññāṇaṁ and nāmarūpaṁ are mutually dependent on each other.\nWe perceive forms through our senses (saḷāyatanaṁ) and through our senses we experience the world around us (phasso). From this experience, we start developing feelings (vedanā) - we like some experiences or forms, and we dislike or are indifferent to other experiences or forms. We develop cravings (taṇhā) for experiences and forms that we like, and aversions to experiences and forms we don’t like, and these cravings and aversions influence or “fuel” future decisions or choices (upādānaṁ), that ultimately the “fuel” feed into our consciousness, and so the cycle repeats.\nIt is a vicious cycle that feeds on itself and will not end unless there is a way to break out of the cycle. The driving forces fueling the cycle are referred to as the Five Masses of Fuel (pañcupādānakkhandhā). These five masses are directly related to the vicious cycle of existence:\nOur conceptualisation of forms is a fuel (rūpakkhandho) and drives how we perceive and name forms (nāmarūpaṁ). ‘Forms’ consume us and drive our desire and cravings - our desire to look beautiful and attractive for example drives a multi-billion dollar beauty industry. We also desire to “own” forms, to possess them, to make them part of us and to give us satisfaction. Similar, our feelings act as fuel (vedanākkhandho) - we desire more of what we like and avoid what we don’t like (vedanā) Our perceptions (interpretations and conceptualisations of what we experience, such as the ability to recognise colours) also act as a fuel (saññākkhandho) - for example we want to be popular and liked by others, and we in turn judge others through our senses (saḷāyatanaṁ) and our contact with others (phasso). Based on our desire and craving for various forms, feelings, and perceptions, we make choices and decisions (saṅkhārakkhandho) which directly impact the results or implications of those intentions (saṅkhārā). For example, our like and dislike for others influence how we behave with them. And finally our consciousness itself is a fuel (viññāṇakkhandho). Our awareness of our existence leads to our primary craving - a desire to survive and to continue existence, to maintain our form and our consciousness (viññāṇaṁ) Together these Five Masses of Fuel feed a massive and intense fire (caused by desire) that consumes us, every moment of our lives (sabbaṁādittaṁ). It enflames not only our present existence (bhavo), but leads to birth and rebirth (jāti) and eventually to old age and death (jarāmaraṇaṁ), and so the cycle of existence (saṃsāra) ever revolves.\nThis is clearly unsatisfactory (dukkhaṁ). Not only unsatisfactory, but the burning of the five fuels ultimately results in pain and suffering, that lasts throughout the entire cycle of saṃsāra.\nWhy suffering? Surely there are moments of pleasure, moments of happiness? Maybe, if we indulge in our senses and revel in pleasure and happiness, we can forget about the pain and suffering. But deep inside, we know nothing lasts forever. We cannot sustain happiness and pleasure indefinitely, we all eventually grow old and die.\nWe come to the realisation: nothing we experience is permanent (aniccaṁ), and therefore everything is ultimately unsatisfactory. Fundamentally, even our consciousness is impermanent (as it is continuously affected by what we have previously experienced), so there no sense of “self” that is permanent or unchanging (anatta).\nIs there a way out of these vicious cycles (both the vicious cycle caused by the five masses of fuel, and the vicious cycle of saṃsāra)?\nFortunately, the Buddha found a way (dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā, or the Path of progress towards the End of Suffering), that does not require either indulgence of senses or extreme practices. The way is practical, achievable within one lifetime, and consists of the following eight components (ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, the Pure Path in eight parts):\nsammādiṭṭhi: The first step is of course to understand what we have just discussed (cattāri ariyasaccāni): that everything is unsatisfactory (dukkhaṁ), and impermanent, including our sense of self. The origin of this suffering (dukkhasamudayaṁ) is our craving which drives the five masses of fuel. In order to end the vicious cycle of suffering, we need to stop fueling the fire (dukkhanirodhaṁ). And to stop fueling the fire, we need to engage in the following components of the way. sammāsaṅkappo: Ultimately, we need to abandon our dependence on sensual pleasures (which are impermanent) and focus on ethical and moral conduct, such as good will and well being towards everything. Unwholesome and unskilled actions are sub-optimal and stem from bad intentions, resulting in harm to ourselves and others. Good intentions and optimal behaviour lead to wholesome actions and a detachment from sensual pleasures. sammāvācā: We should also avoid speech that is false, divisive, harsh or nonsensical. sammākammanto: We should also refrain from unethical and immoral actions, such as killing or harming other living beings, stealing and ultimately even sexual activity (for this propagates the vicious cycle). It may seem strange that we want to deny our fundamental biological imperative, but our desire for procreation overrides rationality and fuels our craving and leads us to uncontrollable behaviour. sammāājīvo: We should lead an exemplary life, avoiding activities and even thoughts that are unethical or result in further craving and unwholesome thoughts. sammāvāyāmo: We should make all effort to eradicate even the arising of bad or unwholesome thoughts and desires, ensure any bad or unwholesome thoughts that we already harbour are dissipated, and instead promote and maintain wholesome and ethical thoughts. sammāsati: We should be hyper-aware of ourselves, by observing our bodies, our feelings, how we think, our value systems. We are constantly mindful to ensure we are stopping all thoughts and activities leading to fueling our cravings. sammāsamādhi: Finally, we will recognise that once we have successfully abandoned our dependence on sensual cravings, removed unwholesome or unskilled qualities, we will gradually realise our entire outlook, disposition and mindset have progressed, over a set of four stages. In the first stage, we finally realise the joy and bliss of a calm mind that is free of delusions, cravings, and bad intentions. In the second stage, we gain internal clarity as our mind becomes focused and concentrated as it is no longer distracted. In the third stage, we become tranquil as we let go even of joy and bliss and become dispassionate and embrace equanimity. In the fourth stage, we completely let go and realise we are no longer tied to the vicious cycle of saṃsāra. With this realisation, we are finally free, we have broken out of the vicious cycle. Thus we have attained enlightenment or “perfect awakening.” The above represents the “core” of what the Buddha taught, everything else is arguably elaboration and further clarification. The teaching is not only practical but also effective. Anecdotally, many individuals attained enlightenment during the Buddha’s lifetime and presumably more even after his death. Many people try to follow that teaching today, including myself.\nHow do we know the Buddha existed and his teachings are authentic? According to the book The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts:\nthere is a body of Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs), which is clearly distinguishable from all other Buddhist scripture; these texts originated from a single historical personality, the Buddha The book’s main conclusion is:\n… that the Early Buddhist Texts originated in the lifetime of the Buddha or a little later, because they were, in the main, spoken by the Buddha and his contemporary disciples. This is the most simple, natural, and reasonable explanation for the evidence.\nOur argument covers two main areas:\nThe grounds for distinguishing the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) from later Buddhist literature; The evidence that the EBTs stem from close to the Buddha’s lifetime, and that they were generally spoken by the historical Buddha. However, it is also true (from the book) that:\n… the texts bear all the marks of redaction and editing, and that they have been optimised for the oral tradition. There are even a few cases where the editorial hand seems to have added interpretations to existing ideas. But to assume from this that the literature as a whole has not conserved the central ideas propounded by its founder, or even that it was invented ad hoc by redactors, is to lose sight of the distinction between editing and composing. So when we say that the texts were “spoken by the Buddha”, we mean it in this non-literal sense.\nMy view is probably less optimistic than that stated in the book. I do believe that (some, perhaps most) the Buddha’s actual teachings are contained in the Tipiṭaka, but perhaps not the actual words he used and also potentially his teachings have been enhanced with additional material that he never taught. There may be material taught in other languages that were not translated into Pali and hence not included, I would like to think these have equivalents that were included. More serious are suggestions that some of Buddha’s teachings may have been omitted (or perhaps actively censored) because of the schisms between the various sects that developed in the years following the Buddha’s death. These omissions can be partially compensated by comparing his teachings across the major sects, which have been done by several scholars, notably Anālayo, Sujato, Allon amongst others.\nAs an alternative view, David Drewes in The Idea Of The Historical Buddha, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 40 • 2017 • 1–25, argues against regarding the Buddha as a historical figure:\n… nothing about him has ever been established as fact, and the standard position in scholarship has long been that he is a figure about whom we know nothing. My only real suggestion is that we make the small shift from speaking of an unknown, contentless Buddha to accepting that we do not have grounds for speaking of a historical Buddha at all. of course, it is possible that there was some single, actual person behind the nebulous “śramaṇa Gautama” of the early texts, but this is very far from necessarily the case, and even if such a person did exist, we have no idea who he was.\nThe evolution (and devolution) of Buddha’s teachings We cannot be assured that the Tipiṭaka contains the exact words of his teachings, nor can we be assured it only contains his teachings and not additional material added after he has died.\nAlthough all efforts have been made to preserve the accuracy of the teachings, errors and omissions may have crept in over the years. In particular, the words have been rearranged so that his teachings are suitable for oral recitation and memorisation. Sentences may have been altered, rearranged, and added to. Additional content may have been added (potentially from disciples, or imported from other teachers and philosophies such as Jainism, Brahmanism or Hinduism).\nTherefore, every sentence in the Tipiṭaka needs to be carefully considered and evaluated before we accept it as something he actually taught.\nThis applies even to (supposedly) his earliest discourses. According to Mahākhandhaka Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100, the five monks that Buddha taught the first and second discourses to all attained enlightenment (presumably immediately afterwards):\n6.29.4 Imasmiñca pana veyyākaraṇasmiṁ bhaññamāne pañcavaggiyānaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ anupādāya āsavehi cittāni vimucciṁsu.\nAnd while this exposition was being spoken to the monks from the group of five, their minds were freed from the corruptions through letting go.\nAnd yet, in Pāsarāsisutta MN 26 PTS 1.161–1.175:\n29.1 Asakkhiṁ kho ahaṁ, bhikkhave, pañcavaggiye bhikkhū saññāpetuṁ.\nI was able to persuade the group of five bhikkhus.\n29.2 Dvepi sudaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhū ovadāmi, tayo bhikkhū piṇḍāya caranti.\nThen sometimes I advised two bhikkhus, while the other three went for alms.\n29.3 Yaṁ tayo bhikkhū piṇḍāya caritvā āharanti tena chabbaggiyā yāpema.\nThen those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.\n29.4 Tayopi sudaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhū ovadāmi, dve bhikkhū piṇḍāya caranti.\nSometimes I advised three bhikkhus, while the other two went for alms.\n29.5 Yaṁ dve bhikkhū piṇḍāya caritvā āharanti tena chabbaggiyā yāpema.\nThen those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.\nSo it would seem the 5 monks were not enlightened immediately, but it was a process that took some time. Johannes Bronkhorst argues in The Two Traditions Of Meditation In Ancient India p. 84 that the Buddha’s early teachings were probably “personal advice, adjusted to the needs of each person.” Both Bronkhorst and Gombrich argues that the Four Pure Truths (cattāri ariyasaccāni) are unlikely to constitute “liberating insight” as they do not really describe the specific process of attaining liberation or articulate the necessary prerequisites, such as the elimination of effluents or intoxicants. Therefore, it seems likely the exact formulation of the truths are a later synthesis. Similar arguments can be made for the contents of the Second and Third Discourses, and even the formulation of the links to Dependent Origination may have been adjusted and amended over time, given the variance in the number of items in the chain in various suttas.\nTurning buddhavacana into abhidhamma and Mahāyāna According to Jayarava in Why Did Buddhists Abandon Buddhavacana?:\nThere is no general agreement, whether historically or presently, on what constitutes buddhavacana. The concept is also contested in the sense that Buddhists found the buddhavacana they inherited unconvincing or otherwise unsatisfactory and replaced it with other words that they labelled buddhavacana, a practice that is arguably still current.\nWhy would anyone do this, ie. deliberately replace or augment the Buddha’s teachings with related and similar teachings? One answer may lie in the Uttaravipattisutta AN 8.8 PTS 4.162–4.166, where Utarra delivered a seemingly “original” discourse to some monks (presumably sometime after the Buddha had passed away). King Vessavaṇa overheard the discourse, and went to the gods of the Thirty-Three to ask Sakka, lord of the gods, whether this was an “authentic” teaching, one that the Buddha might have taught. Sakka was so concerned by this he appeared in front of Uttara and asked:\n5.7 “Kiṁ panidaṁ, bhante, āyasmato uttarassa sakaṁ paṭibhānaṁ, udāhu tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ arahato sammāsambuddhassā”ti?\n“Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”\nUttara’s reply is interesting. According to Anālayo in The Dawn of Abhidharma p. 149:\nUttara illustrates this with the help of using a simile that describes a large group of people who take grain from a great heap and carry it away in various containers. On being asked where they got the grain, they will answer that they got it from the great heap. The simile makes it clear that the dictum was meant to indicate that the Buddha was the real source of anything Uttara had been teaching, even if Uttara had not been repeating something that in this exact manner had already been spoken by the Buddha.\nThe discourse then takes an interesting turn, as Śakra informs Uttara that the Buddha had actually given this teaching earlier. However, memory of this teaching delivered by the Buddha had in the meantime been lost among the four assemblies of disciples (monks, nuns, male lay followers, and female lay followers).\nThis illustrates that some of Buddha’s disciples felt confident enough they fully understood Budhha’s teachings that they could craft original discourses in the belief the Buddha would have spoken them if he had still been alive. Moreover, it implies that some of Buddha’s teachings have indeed been “lost” but it is acceptable for enlightened monks to resuscitate them, thus paving the way for some sects to claim that they have additional suttas that potentially supersede Buddha’s teachings because these “extra” suttas were previously “lost” or “hidden.” For example, the Mahayanists claim the Lotus Sutra was Buddha’s last sermon, even though the style and character of the sutra is very different from those in the Tipiṭaka.\nOnce the first step has been established, it seemed logical to continue and create additional original discourses. For example, the Anupadasutta MN 111 PTS 3.25–3.29 is a discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya of the Theravāda tradition of which no parallel is known, hence likely to be pure invention of the Theravādans. There are also discourses in the other canonical collections that are not present in the Tipiṭika.\nAccording to Anālayo in [The Dawn of Abhidharma], the Abhidhamma in the Tipiṭaka, which is also unique to Theravāda although other sects have their own versions, evolved from lists of discourse topics (such as the ones found in Saṅgītisutta DN 33 PTS 3.207–3.271 and Dasuttarasutta DN 34 PTS 3.272–3.293), central themes, and potentially commentaries on the discourses into the voluminous collection it is today. The Abhidhamma takes an abstract or conceptual perspective on the core teachings and then exhaustively analyses them by attempting to provide a comprehensive inventory of everything connected to these teachings. Presumably at this time the instructions given in the discourses were perceived as somewhat lacking and insufficient - the final results go beyond what early discourses consider necessary for successful realisation. Eventually the Abhidhamma, which started out as a commentary “about” the dhamma, became the “superior” or “higher” dhamma, thereby overshadowing in importance the texts on which it originally commented.\nAnālayo further points out that from a Mahāyāna viewpoint, “the early discourses are considered as teachings that are “inferior” (hīna). The teachings of the Abhidharma in turn are considered by their followers to be “superior” (abhi-) in comparison to the early discourses. In this way, the early teachings increasingly tend to fade in importance and are eventually superseded by the new texts, a development that in turn led to the formation of independent textual collections, the Abhidharma-piṭaka and the Bodhisattva-piṭaka, considered to be superior to the early discourses.” The Mahayanists then further argue that Mahāyāna is the word of the Buddha which had been collected by bodhisattvas like Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Maitreya, etc. or originated from the realm of the nāgas, as well as from devas, gandharvas, and rākṣasas. They were not included in the canonical collections because they were beyond the ken of the śrāvaka[S]s responsible for collecting the word of the Buddha.\nFor the Theravādans, the Atthasālinī argues that all of the seven texts of the Abhidhamma collection should be considered the word of the Buddha. This would then imply even the texts criticising beliefs of other sects are also the word of the Buddha.\nStandardisation and Creation Mark Allon in his interesting book The Composition and Transmission of Early Buddhist Texts with Specific Reference to Sutras gives “… an overview of the main stylistic features of early Buddhist sutras and the organizational principles employed in the formation of textual collections of sutras that support the idea of these texts and collections being transmitted as fixed entities, and then examine the ways in which such texts changed and were changed over time, attempt to identify the reasons why this occurred, and give an account of the challenge this represents to the idea of oral transmission requiring fixity.” In doing so, he compares the same passages across different canonical collections in various languages such as Gandhari, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan.\nAccording to Mark on p. 10:\nThese texts, both prose and verse, are very much textual or literary artifices. They are not verbatim, or tape-recorder, records of the sayings and discourses of the individuals concerned nor casual descriptions of their actions or of related events. They are highly structured and stylized, extremely formulaic and repetitive, carefully crafted constructs, at least as we have them. And this is so at all levels. Further, the wording used to describe or depict a given event, concept, teaching, or practice is highly standardized across the corpus of such texts transmitted by a given monastic community. As such they do not reflect how a person would normally speak, preach, debate, and interact, or describe an event.\nMany discourses start with:\nevaṃ me sutaṃ ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā ... viharati.\nThus heard by me, at one time the Blessed One dwells in ….\nand often end with:\nidam avoca bhagavā. attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandun ti.\nThe Blessed One said this. Pleased, those bhikkhus (monks) rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One.\nThe text of most suttas seem to be “highly structured, carefully crafted” and therefore unlikely to be the actual words that the Buddha would have used, but a homogenisation or distillation of them into a standardised format (presumably useful for memorization).\nEven the grammar, choice and ordering of words are standardised. As Mark describes in p. 14:\nFor example, a characteristic feature of canonical prose are strings of grammatically parallel units, such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs, that express the same or similar general idea, with each subsequent unit nuancing or expanding the meaning of the preceding ones, presenting further qualities of the thing described, or presenting a similar category of item.\n…\nFurther, the component units of these structures or strings are normally arranged according to a waxing number of syllables, that is, the first unit has fewer syllables than the last (or at least their count does not decrease)\nAn example is this phrase (in bold) from Ānandabhaddekarattasutta MN 132 PTS 3.190–3.191:\n2.1 Tena kho pana samayena āyasmā ānando upaṭṭhānasālāyaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ dhammiyā kathāya sandasseti samādapeti samuttejeti sampahaṁseti, bhaddekarattassa uddesañca vibhaṅgañca bhāsati.\nNow at that time Venerable Ānanda was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night.\nNote the use of the four semi-synonymous verbs all starting with sa with a syllable pattern of 4+5+5+5. Its unlikely this sort of pattern, with shared sound and metrical similarities, would have occured in “normal” speech.\nAnother dominant stylistic characteristic of early Buddhist sutra prose is the use of formulas, that is, the wording used to depict a given concept, action, or event is highly standardized and predictable.\nThe use of formulas can be extended to entire suttas, allowing a number of “artificial” suttas to be created using just one formula. For example, SN 12.4-12.10, “… the Buddha gives an account of the realization of paṭiccasamuppāda by the seven buddhas, beginning with the past buddha Vipassī and ending with himself. Each account is identical except for the change of the name of the buddha. As Allon notes on p. 36:\nIt is hard to imagine the scenario presented here in which a teacher, in this case the Buddha, gives separate discourses on individual buddha’s on different occasions. A more likely scenario is that such a teacher would give an account of his own realization of paṭiccasamuppāda, as we find presented for the Buddha elsewhere in the canon, possibly then followed by a brief statement that the same occurred for the six past buddhas, or more likely, that the Buddha’s account of his own realization was applied to the past buddhas by those who composed these texts to form six additional suttas.\nThere are many other instances in SN and AN where such artificially generated suttas can be found. Why create all these repetitive pseudo-suttas? There are many possible answers, including a “who has more suttas” competition with other religious groups, aids to memorisation, mental training, or a desire to be comprehensive. My personal interpretation is that these variants of suttas form a useful collection of building blocks to choose from, by individual monks or groups, for use when giving public talks to assemblies, choosing a specific sutta at the request of a layperson (perhaps as part of a ceremony or rite of passage), or as a gift or blessing to a patron. Just like a church minister may choose a topic for a Sunday sermon, “building block” suttas can be chosen and either assembled to form a longer discourse, or dissected and explained.\nDifferences, Simplification and Elaboration When we compare suttas with their equivalents or “parallels” in other canonical collections, we often find similarities, but in some cases radical differences across the collections.\nAllon notes in The Composition and Transmission of Early Buddhist Texts with Specific Reference to Sutras on p. 47:\nThe main differences encountered between parallel versions of early Buddhist texts preserved in Pali, Gandhari, or other Prakrit, in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, Sanskrit, Chinese, and/or Tibetan are, apart from language and language related phenomena, the following:\nwhole episodes or descriptions of events, practices, teachings, and so on, found in one version are missing in one or more of the parallels; differences in the sequence of events and order in which teachings are given; differences in the arrangement of information within the description of an event, concept or practice; differences in the information given within the description of an event, concept or practice; different order of items in a list and differences in the number of items listed; differences in the names of people and places in the description of what is essentially the same event; differences in the wording used to portray a given event, concept or practice, including the use of different synonyms, differences in word order, and differences in the complexity of descriptions; differences in the use of markers such as indeclinables and vocatives of address; differences in grammar, e.g. verbal tense, grammatical number, etc. Where do these differences come from, and which one represents the “authentic” words of the Buddha?\nIt is very likely that none of them are truly authentic, but which one best represents the Buddha’s original intent?\nAgain, there are many theories, and debates across scholars. I won’t try and summarise these, but the issue rages on even today, with many conflicting opinions. For example, some scholars (eg. Gombrich, Wynne, Anālayo) argue the more closely aligned a sutta is with it’s parallels, the more likely a sutta is “authentic” since it must have been composed early enough to predate the schisms and the emergence of the various sects. On the other hand, some scholars (eg. Schopen) have also argued the homogeneity may have come from cross-sharing across communities, and “superior” versions of a sutta may be adopted by other sects. This is not as unlikely as it may first appear. We do know monks travelled widely and often stay with foreign communities, so it is not unusual for knowledge sharing to occur.\nOne theory is that some suttas may have been “simplified” by particular communities to aid memorization, or as part of a standardisation process. They may also have been simplified as part of the process of transposing or translating from a different dialect or language.\nThere is also the theory, based on the use of formulas and building blocks, that the longer suttas may well be composed by taking one or more formula, and then elaborating it with a story. Different communities may have different elaborations, and cross sharing may propagate a specific elaboration across more than one community, but with stylistic and textual differences depending on the scribe or preferences of the oral listener.\nInconsistencies The Tipiṭaka is not internally consistent. These inconsistencies have been documented by many scholars including Polak, Gombrich, et al. For example, the chains of Dependent Origination sometimes number 6, 10 or 12. There are 4, sometimes 5, sometimes 6 elements, 12 or 36 sense-fields etc. The Buddha also acknowledges these inconsistencies and explains he has explained the teachings in different ways (Evaṁ pariyāyadesito kho, ānanda, mayā dhammo.) and his disciples could either “deal with it” or start arguing. Bahuvedanīyasutta MN 59 PTS 1.397–1.400\nEven when it is consistent, we cannot be assured of authenticity or accuracy. Through a mechanism known as “pericope” many of his teachings have been altered to insert “stock phrases”, often to “pad” out a relatively short discourse into a more substantial discourse - these phrases may or may not represent his true intention or meaning and their insertion into the text may change the meaning or nuance of the text to something radically different.\nFor example, the first Discourse Dhammacakkappavattanasutta SN 56.11 PTS 5.421–5.424 shows evidence that it was originally shorter, and over time has been expanded (because texts from other sects omit some of the material). Also, the texts errorneously has the Buddha referring to his five former ascetic companions as bhikkhave - a term used for a group of ordained Buddhist monks, and at that time the 5 ascetics have not yet been ordained, for the saṅgha did not exist (yet).\nA good example of the inclusion of a pericope creating a problem in the meaning of a phrase in the sutta is in Cakkavattisutta DN 26 PTS 3.58–3.79. This problem is extensively documented and analysed by Richard Gombrich in Three Souls, One Or None: The Vagaries Of A Pali Pericope, Journal of the Pali Text Society XI (1987) pp. 73 – 78.\nMuch more seriously, it seems some pericopes may not even represent the original teachings of the Buddha, but may have been imported from non-Buddhist practices. Bronkhorst, Polak and Wynne all argue the four arūpa meditative states may have been non-Buddhist practices that were known before the Buddha attained enlightenment:\nthe Stage of Infinity of Space (ākāsānañcāyatana); the Stage of Infinity of Perception (viññāṇañcāyatana); the Stage of Nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatana); the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation (nevasaññānāsaññāyatana). The last two of the above were dismissed by the Buddha as being non-conducive nor leading to enlightenment, and he identified them as specifically the teachings of Āḷāra Kālāma and Rāma in Pāsarāsisutta MN 26 PTS 1.161–1.175.\n15.35 ‘nāyaṁ dhammo nibbidāya na virāgāya na nirodhāya na upasamāya na abhiññāya na sambodhāya na nibbānāya saṁvattati, yāvadeva ākiñcaññāyatanūpapattiyā’ti.\n‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’\n16.35 … yāvadeva nevasaññānāsaññāyatanūpapattiyā’ti\nIt only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’\nYet, inexplicably, these methods were subsequently inserted into various suttas (for example Cūḷasuññatasutta MN 121 PTS 3.104–3.109), presumably by later disciples.\nMisinterpretations Even if his teaching is authentic and accurately preserved, there is a possibility that we (including scholars, practitioners and translators) may misinterpret it.\nGombrich stated in What the Buddha Thought p.2 that the Buddha was “startlingly original”. He questioned and refuted his ideological opponents, he often has a different perspective and does not follow the same philosophical path as others. His way of thinking is also very different from orthodox traditions. Even today, the Buddha’s teachings are strikingly different from other major religions.\nTherefore it is not surprising that some followers and practitioners of Buddhism may not have interpreted his teachings in the way he intended. It is possible to derive realist, idealist, mystical, nihilist and other interpretations, by emphasing some teachings and deemphasising others. Some ignore the historical context of his teachings and may not realise that some teachings are refutations of braministic and Jainistic beliefs, and instead interpret the Buddha as endorsing or even promoting these beliefs. It is the human tendency to see what we want to see, and to filter ideas through our own biases and prejudices.\nThe Buddha himself warns against the danger of misinterpreting the texts by people who only memorise the words but don’t grasp the meaning in Alagaddūpamasutta MN 22 PTS 1.130–1.142.\n10.1 Idha, bhikkhave, ekacce moghapurisā dhammaṁ pariyāpuṇanti— suttaṁ, geyyaṁ, veyyākaraṇaṁ, gāthaṁ, udānaṁ, itivuttakaṁ, jātakaṁ, abbhutadhammaṁ, vedallaṁ.

Tesaṁ te dhammā duggahitā dīgharattaṁ ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattanti. Taṁ kissa hetu? Duggahitattā, bhikkhave, dhammānaṁ.\nAccording to Gombrich’s translation in How Buddhism Began p. 23:\n…some foolish people memorise his teachings but do not use their intelligence to work out what they mean, so that the teachings afford them no insight. The advantages they derive from their learning are being able to criticise others and to quote; but they do not get what should be the real benefit of such learning. Because they have misunderstood the teaching, it only does them harm.\nSome people believe that the Buddha’s teachings are esoteric and difficult to understand, that they transcend rationality and ultimately describe supramundane ideas that is inexpressible in language. I used to think this too, but now I believe the core teachings of the Buddha are simple and understandable as long as one is willing to set aside preconceptions and pay attention to what he is truly trying to say.\nLack of context Many people today experience the Buddha’s teachings by reading translated texts, or following the teachings of a Buddhist teacher in their native language, or English. This is understandable, as Pāli is a “dead” language, so it is no one’s native language. I believe that to truly understand the Buddha’s teaching, one needs to read the “original” Pāli texts. No matter how good the translation may be, few words have precise equivalents across languages, and in particular abstract or technical terms are very difficult to translate and prone to misinterpretations and ambiguities. (What the Buddha Thought p. 5)\nIn addition, some of his teachings reference Vedic or Brahman philosophy and sometimes cannot be properly understood without knowledge of the these philosophies.\nA good example is the doctrine of anattā which is widely translated as “no self”, but the word attā in Pali (ātman[S]) refers to the Vedic notion of an “eternal self” that was originally linked to the universal principle of brahman[S] and the Supreme Being and Creator God Brahmā[S]. According to Vedic literature, one who is freed from desire becomes immortal and joins with the brahman and the Brahmā (or sometimes described as “union with the Godhead”). The ātman, brahman and Brahmā are all manifestations of the the same concept but across the microscopic, macroscopic and cosmic realms. The Buddha’s anattā doctrine is a refutal of this and so translating it as “no self” is inadequate and can lead to a common misinterpretation that the Buddha was promoting the concept of nihilism. (What the Buddha Thought pp. 36-43)\nSometimes, the lack of context can can have humourous consequences. The well-known story of the notorious murderer Aṅgulimāla in Aṅgulimālasutta MN 86 PTS 2.98–2.105 creates a problem where we don’t really know why Aṅgulimāla was wearing a garland of fingers and apparently murdering people. The Papañca-sudani commentary on this sutta (ascribed to Buddhaghosa) invents a complete backstory for Aṅgulimāla but it is incoherent. The verse associated with the sutta is also difficult to parse and doesn’t scan properly, which means it is corrupted. Gombrich convincingly argues in How Buddhism Began Chapter V, that Aṅgulimāla must have been a Śaiva/Śākta believer who worshipped Śiva, a goddess that takes limbs from corpses and wears a garland and Aṅgulimāla was trying to adopt the deity’s iconic appearance and emulating the goddess’ behaviour.\nIn some places, the Buddha even adopts a satirical tone by making fun at accepted Brahman philosophy and beliefs. The Aggaññasutta DN 27 PTS 3.80–3.98 clearly is a parody of brahminical cosmogony. As Gombrich notes on HBB81:\nThe whole story of the origin of society, which forms the bulk of the text, is a parody of brahminical texts, especially the Ṛg Vedic ‘Hymn of Creation’ (RV X, 129) and the cosmogony at BAU 1, 2. The formation of the earth at the beginning of a world-cycle, its population by beings, their gradual social differentiation, the origins of sex and property, and finally the invention of kingship and the creation of the four brahminical varja (social classes) – all are a parodistic re-working of brahminical speculations, and at the same time an allegory of the malign workings of desire.\nBuddhists should know the Buddha has already proclaimed the universe as having no absolute beginning, it’s just the cycle of existence. As per Tiṇakaṭṭhasutta SN 15.1 PTS 2.178:\n1.7 Anamataggoyaṁ, bhikkhave, saṁsāro.\nTransmigration has no known beginning.\n1.8 Pubbā koṭi na paññāyati avijjānīvaraṇānaṁ sattānaṁ taṇhāsaṁyojanānaṁ sandhāvataṁ saṁsarataṁ.\nNo first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving.\nDespite that, according to Gombrich on p. 82:\nBuddhists have since the earliest times taken it seriously as an account of the origins of society and kingship, and even traced the Buddha’s own royal origins back to Maha-sammata, the person chosen to be the first king; they have interpreted the word as a proper name, though it originally meant ‘agreed to be great’. But now we see that the Buddha never intended to propound a cosmogony.\nMany of the Buddha’s teachings are delivered in a style known as pariyāya (“roundabout” or “indirect”), which employs metaphors, allegories, parables which are not meant to be interpreted literally. These metaphors are based on the social and historical context of Buddha’s time, and may not be easily grasped in the absence of that context. (What the Buddha Thought p. 6)\nGombrich further argues in HBB75:\n… much of the narrative telling what the Buddha did in the days and weeks following his Enlightenment is allegorical in origin; and I suspect that one could push this argument even further. The same goes for his biography up to the Enlightenment. Others have noticed this before me, so I shall not dwell on it. The stress on the luxury in which the future Buddha was brought up serves to emphasise his mature rejection of worldly goods. His being shielded from all knowledge of old age, sickness and death symbolises the way in which we turn a blind eye to the unpleasant facts of existence, and heightens the impact of the prince’s encounter with the four “signs” or omens (pubba nimitta): the story of how on his way to the pleasure grounds he successively encounters an aged man, an ill man, a corpse, and a tranquil ascetic who seems to offer the solution.\nOf course Māra, the personification of Death, appears in Buddhist literature in several places, and usually signifies desire, or craving. Even then, different authors and compilers had different opinions and attitudes.\nFurthermore, the Buddha often employs a method known as upāya-kauśalya[S] (“skill in means”) where he responds to an opponent not by disagreeing with them, but by appearing to agree but then take their words and reinterpret them to give them quite different meanings that demonstrate the Buddha’s perspective. An example is kamma which means “act, action, deed” and in brahmanism signifies ritualistic practice, ie. one acquires merit by performing rituals correctly. The Buddha redefines kamma to mean “intention” so he took a word that was meant literally into a metaphor. All these subtleties are often lost in translation, and sometimes can be interpreted as the Buddha agreeing with a position when he was actually trying to refute it. (Gombrich, How Buddhism Began pp. 17-18, also What the Buddha Thought p. 7)\nWas the Buddha omniscient and was he able to predict the future? Bhikkhu Anālayo states in The Genesis of the Bodhisattva Ideal, Hamburg University Press 2010 p. 51 that\nGautama’s decease must have created a vacuum that needed to be filled. Bereft of the possibility of having a personal encounter with the living Buddha, for disciples in need of some form of emotional contact with the object of their first refuge, recollecting his marvellous qualities would have been of considerable importance.\n…\nThe vacuum created by the teacher’s demise would have had its effect not only on the internal level – within the community of disciples – but also on the external level, namely in relation to other contemporary religious groups and practitioners.\nHence there is a need to “authenticate” the Buddha as an eminent spiritual teacher by referencing his noble and spiritual lineage, his mastery of supernatural powers, his omniscience, and ultimately the ability for a devotee to “take refuge” and “receive blessings” from one long departed.\nLet’s examine the Buddha’s supposed prediction of the advent of the “next” Buddha. This is mainly described in the Madhyama-āgama in the Discourse on an Explanation about the Past (說本 MA 66 T i 508c09). According to Anālayo in The Genesis of the Bodhisattva Ideal p. 113:\nThe Buddha thereupon narrates in detail how in a future time, when human lifespan will reach up to eighty thousand years, a wheel-turning king by the name of Śaṅkha will arise, who eventually will go forth and reach liberation. On hearing this description, a monk by the name of Ajita stands up and, with hands held in respectful gesture towards the Buddha, aspires to become the wheel-turning King Śaṅkha at that future time. The Buddha rebukes Ajita for postponing what could already be accomplished now – namely attaining liberation – after which he nevertheless predicts that Ajita will indeed become the wheel-turning King Śaṅkha.\nThe Buddha continues by describing the Buddha Maitreya under whom Śaṅkha will go forth. Another monk by the same name of Maitreya stands up and, with hands held in respectful gesture towards the Buddha, formulates the aspiration of becoming the future Buddha Maitreya. The Buddha praises him for making such an aspiration, predicts that he will indeed become the future Buddha Maitreya, and bestows a golden coloured robe on him.\nIt seems odd that the Buddha rebukes Ajita for deferring his liberation and yet praises Maitreya for his aspiration to become the next Buddha. It would have made more sense for Maitreya to become the next Buddha whilst the current Buddha was still alive, allowing for a smooth transition and a succession plan.\nIn the Tipiṭaka, Maitreya is also stated as the next Buddha in Cakkavattisutta DN 26 PTS 3.58–3.79. The placing of the occurrence of the Maitreya episode in parallels of this sutta across the canons of the three major sects show the following variations:\nafter the description of the wheel-turning king Saṅkha (Cakkavattisutta in the Dīgha Nikāya); before the description of the wheel-turning king Saṅkha (轉輪聖王修行經 in the Dīrgha Āgama); not found at all (轉輪王經 in the Madhyama Āgama). Anālayo theorises that the inclusion of Maitreya seems to be a late addition, as there would be no reason to exclude it. Furthermore, the corresponding paragraph in Cakkavattisutta following where the Maitreya episode has been inserted seems a bit clumsy, and would have been a better transition if it immediately followed the description of King Saṅkha. Therefore:\nCompared to these two versions, the Madhyama-āgama discourse appears to testify to a state of the discourse when this addition had not yet happened.\nThe real issue here is that this presumes the Buddha is able to predict the future, to the precise names and actions of individuals, which presupposes a “deterministic” universe and contradicts the supposed “free will” embodied in Dependent Origination (ie. one has the ability to consciously choose to cease and fade away the links in the chain). According to Anālayo in p. 108:\nA problem with the present passage in all versions is that, if taken literally, it presents a precise prediction of the names and actions of individuals at a rather distant time in the future. In the Pāli discourses, the present passage is thus not only the sole reference to the Buddha Maitreya, but also the sole instance where such a type of prediction is given.\nFrom the perspective of the early Buddhist conception of causality, to make precise predictions that at some remote time in the future someone named so-and-so will do such-and-such a thing to some degree conflicts with the notion of dependent arising (pratītya-samutpāda), according to which things are conditioned but not wholly determined. To predict the far away future in such detail would require a strong form of predeterminism. There should not be any free will or choice operating in the lives of the people concerned – in particular in the lives of the two individuals that will become the wheel-turning king and the Buddha in the future – otherwise they might end up doing something that differs from what has been predicted.\nIn fact, Upāli even questions the Buddha’s prediction in T 452 at T XIV 418c7, and according to Anālayo on p. 127:\nUpāli questions the Buddha about the monk who has been predicted as the future Buddha Maitreya. In his query, Upāli expresses his puzzlement about the fact that this monk neither engages in the development of concentration nor eradicates his defilements.\nAnālayo then further theorises on p. 125 that the primary purpose for introducing Maitreya as the next Buddha seems to be to address:\n… the needs of the faithful in search of a way of compensating for the loss of leadership and inspiration after the demise of the teacher. … The Discourse on an Explanation about the Past more directly addresses the dilemma of the teacher’s disappearance by providing a substitute for the deceased Gautama: the bodhisattva Maitreya who will continue the lineage of Buddhas by becoming the next fully-awakened Buddha.\nThis tendency to exalt the Buddha as a consequence of the vacuum created by his decease, initiated by an increasing concern with his marvels and with his predecessors and successor(s), eventually blossomed into a claim that the Buddha was in fact omniscient.\nIn Pāsarāsisutta MN 26 PTS 1.161–1.175 we find lo and behold the Buddha indeed claimed to know “all”:\n25.6 ‘Sabbābhibhū sabbavidūhamasmi,\n‘I am the champion, the knower of all,\n25.7 Sabbesu dhammesu anūpalitto;\nunsullied in the midst of all things.\nFurthermore, this was subsequently expanded to anyone who wishes to reach enlightenment, and in fact it is not possible to attain awakening without understanding and fully knowing “all” in Sabbapariññāsutta Iti 7 PTS 4 PTS 4 Verse 7:\n2.1 “Sabbaṁ, bhikkhave, anabhijānaṁ aparijānaṁ tattha cittaṁ avirājayaṁ appajahaṁ abhabbo dukkhakkhayāya.\"\n“Mendicants, without directly knowing and completely understanding the all, without dispassion for it and giving it up, you can’t end suffering.\nHowever, these two passages presumably had an original meaning not of omniscience but that an enlightened person truly “saw things as they are”. In Kāḷakārāmasutta AN 4.24 PTS 2.25–2.26 this was clarified to:\n2.1 Yaṁ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṁ sutaṁ mutaṁ viññātaṁ pattaṁ pariyesitaṁ anuvicaritaṁ manasā, tamahaṁ jānāmi.\n“In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind: that I know.\nIn fact the Buddha explicitly denied having ever made a claim to omniscience in Tevijjavacchasutta MN 71 PTS 1.482–1.483, but this sutta seems to have been omitted in other canons, possibly a sign of censorship.\n5.1 “sutaṁ metaṁ, bhante:\n“Sir, I have heard this:\n5.2 ‘samaṇo gotamo sabbaññū sabbadassāvī, aparisesaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paṭijānāti,\n‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:\n5.3 carato ca me tiṭṭhato ca suttassa ca jāgarassa ca satataṁ samitaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paccupaṭṭhitan’ti.\n“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”’\n5.4 Ye te, bhante, evamāhaṁsu: ‘samaṇo gotamo sabbaññū sabbadassāvī, aparisesaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paṭijānāti, carato ca me tiṭṭhato ca suttassa ca jāgarassa ca satataṁ samitaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paccupaṭṭhitan’ti, kacci te, bhante, bhagavato vuttavādino, na ca bhagavantaṁ abhūtena abbhācikkhanti, dhammassa cānudhammaṁ byākaronti, na ca koci sahadhammiko vādānuvādo gārayhaṁ ṭhānaṁ āgacchatī”ti?\nI trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”\n5.5 “Ye te, vaccha, evamāhaṁsu: ‘samaṇo gotamo sabbaññū sabbadassāvī, aparisesaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paṭijānāti, carato ca me tiṭṭhato ca suttassa ca jāgarassa ca satataṁ samitaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paccupaṭṭhitan’ti, na me te vuttavādino, abbhācikkhanti ca pana maṁ asatā abhūtenā”ti.\n“Vaccha, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”\nKaṇṇakatthalasutta MN 90 PTS 2.126–2.133 then seems to soften this:\n‘natthi so samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā yo sakideva sabbaṁ ñassati, sabbaṁ dakkhiti, netaṁ ṭhānaṁ vijjatī’”ti.\n‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will know all and see all simultaneously: that is not possible.’”\nSo apparently it may be possible to know and see all, just not at once. This paves the way to declare the Buddha as “serially omniscient” in Sabbaññubhāvapañha Mil 5.1.2 PTS 103–107:\n“Bhante nāgasena, buddho sabbaññū”ti?\n‘Venerable Nāgasena, was the Buddha omniscient?’\n“Āma, mahārāja, bhagavā sabbaññū, na ca bhagavato satataṁ samitaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ paccupaṭṭhitaṁ, āvajjanapaṭibaddhaṁ bhagavato sabbaññutañāṇaṁ, āvajjitvā yadicchakaṁ jānātī”ti.\n‘Yes, O king, he was. But the insight of knowledge was not always and continually (consciously) present with him. The omniscience of the Blessed One was dependent on reflection.’ But if he did reflect he knew whatever he wanted to know.\nBut wait, according to Anālayo in The Dawn of Abhidharma p. 120, 一切智 MA 212 at T i 793c6 states: “Counterparts to this statement in the Madhyama-āgama and in the Bhaiṣajyavastu of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya have the slightly different formulation that there is no other recluse or Brahmin who has omniscient knowledge at once.” So, others are not omniscient, but the Buddha can be.\nAccording to Sujato, this paves the way for Buddha’s omniscience to be the standard view in later books:\nUpasīvamāṇavapucchāniddesa Cnd 10 5.2, Sumedhapatthanākathā Bv 2 PTS (2nd ed) 1.9–1.21 55.3, Chakkauddesa Pp 1.6 2.1, Balakathā Kv 3.1 PTS 228–232 5.3, etc. Anālayo then points out that in Ekottarāgama 48.3 at T II 787c4: “the Tathāgata … thoroughly understands all in the three times: future, past, and present”, 如來 … 當來, 過去, 現在, 三世皆悉明了; the same statement recurs in T 453 (佛說彌勒下生經) at T XIV 421a8.\nGombrich states in Popperian Vinaya: Conjecture and Refutation in Practice, in Pramāṇakīrtiḥ, Papers Dedicated to Ernst Steinkellner on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday (2007): “… the idea that the Buddha was omniscient is strikingly at odds with the picture of him presented in every Vinaya tradition”. These “show that the Buddha … occasionally made a false start and found it necessary to reverse a decision. Since omniscience includes knowledge of the future, this is not omniscience.”\nAlso, one would imagine that the Buddha, if he had been omniscient and could predict the future, would have been able to prevent many things, including the uprising of Devadatta.\nBuddhist sociology The Buddha lived in a period of urbanisation in India, transitioning from villages to towns and cities, together with the rise of trade (across cities and towns). The population was divided into 4 castes (varṇa[S]) (as well as “outcastes” or those outside the social hierarchy). There was an established or “mainstream” religious and cultural system that I will call “brahmanism” administered by the religious caste (brāhmaṇa[S]).3\nHowever, with the rise of trade, members of the merchant and farming caste (vaiśya[S]), together with the political caste (kṣatriya[S]), were becoming more affluent and powerful and were open to new religious ideas. These represent the primary audience that was drawn to the Buddha’s teachings, although the Buddha also won converts from brahmanism and welcomed followers from the artisan and worker caste (śūdra[S]).\nOne would expect the sort of person who would be drawn to Buddha’s teachings would typically be wealthy and educated, with leisure time and experienced in various sensual pleasures, who would grow to be disenchanted with what life has to offer and gradually question whether there were alternative answers outside of brahmanism.4\nThere were already other alternatives to brahmanism, including Jainism, and those practising alternate religious practices were generally classified as ascetics.\nThe Buddha himself was initially an ascetic when he renounced and left the worldly life and for a time practised asceticism. Later on he would denounce many aspects of ascetic practice (although he conceded some ascetic practices are beneficial), but he also understood the general population would consider him an ascetic and he encouraged his followers to refer to themselves as “ascetics who are followers of the Sakyan” (samaṇā sakyaputtiyāmhā, Aggaññasutta DN 27 9.2), evidently to distinguish themselves from other kinds of ascetics.\nA unique community developed around Buddhism during Buddha’s time, and still survives today (albeit with modifications) in Buddhist dominated countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and even in countries where Buddhism isn’t the dominant religion.\nThis community started when the Buddha invited those he felt understood his teachings to “join” him. Others asked Buddha to accept them as disciples and followers. Some are renunciants like him and adopted his simple lifestyle of wearing a robe and dependent on householders for food and other necessities. Others continued in their worldly lives but came to hear his sermons and to provide alms and other donations to him.\nThis community became known as the saṅgha. Anyone who joined the saṅgha left their caste behind, so the Buddha promoted the intermingling of castes within the community. Instead of the 4 castes separated by profession or birth, the saṅgha consisted of four types of followers:\nbhikkhu: male renunciants bhikkhuni: female renunciants upāsaka: male lay devotees upāsikā: female lay devotees The “fourfold assembly” would often meet together for events (such as during uposatha days when monastic confess their faults to each other and recite the monastic rules communally, and followers intensify their practices), or to hear a public sermon or lecture, often given by the Buddha or one of his senior disciples. The saṅgha also had a missionary purpose, monastics were sent out to spread the word and encourage people to join.\nAlso, anyone who is enlightened is part of the “pure saṅgha” or āryasaṅgha, whether they were formerly part of any saṅghas or not. This is a sort of uber-saṅgha, or an Enlightened Society, of arahants. Today there is no formal āryasaṅgha as it is believed there are no known arahants (more on this in the next section).\nInitially the saṅgha was a loose, informal community, but as Buddha’s followers grew into thousands spread across multiple cities, some degree of control was required. The Buddha was reluctant to impose a command and control hierarchy, so to a large extent the community governed itself, with seniority (and gender) used as a basis for relative relationships within the community. However, a set of rules was established for this Utopian society, primarily to ensure there were norms for acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.\nThe rules started out few and straightforward, but over time grew into a complex set. New rules were added by necessity, and each rule was accompanied by a clear case study justifying its inclusion. Rules were sometimes changed or rescinded due to unexpected and unforeseen circumstances. Throughout this process, we become acutely aware that the Buddha was a human being after all, he made mistakes and had to rectify them. Despite the Buddha saying before he passed away that the minor rules can be abolished after his death5, the First Council after the Buddha’s death couldn’t decide which rules were minor and which were major. Indeed, scholars believe the rules continued to be expanded for several centuries after and the current version may date to 3 BCE.6\nThe Buddha consistently showed us that he was fair, but also practical. When King Bimbisāra, a very important benefactor, complained that soldiers were deserting his army to become monks, the Buddha then forbade soldiers from being ordained.7 Similar, slaves were not allowed to be ordained, lest they desert their masters.8 In one year the King requested the rainy season retreat (vassa) be delayed, and the Buddha advised his disciples to comply.9 Rather than being the omniscient being that was revered by the gods, the Buddha was in fact the loyal vassal of a human king. But he was also a practical man adapting to social expectations. He did not reject the social conventions of his day: the caste system, inequality between the genders, the principles of trade and commerce, or the rules by which society was governed. Revolutionary anarchist he was not.\nOver time, lay disciples became progressively excluded from the saṅgha. It was embarrassing for monastics to have the laity listening in on the monastics confessing their transgressions, and eventually it was too much even for the whole monastic community to hear each other’s confessions. So confessions became a private affair between pairs or small groups of monastics. Gradually, the saṅgha transformed from a Utopian Society into an exclusive club for mostly male monastics, who by and large were not answerable to anyone but themselves.\nSome parts of the teachings were not allowed to be disclosed to the laity, for various reasons. Benefactors and donators were very important - thousands of monastics need to be fed daily and provided with necessities. So any teaching that might jeopardise this precarious balance must be handled with care. The Buddha’s core teachings with a soteriological goal which is dependent on renouncing oneself from worldly life, may not appeal to everyone. Indeed, some of the teachings, such as those articulating meditation techniques focusing on rotting corpses (to cultivate a distaste for the pleasures of the flesh and to remind the listener of the impermanence of life) may not even be palatable to ordinary people. So eventually the core teachings were only disclosed to the monastics, people who were serious enough to pursue the soteriological goal, and the teachings to lay people focused on virtue, morality, the importance of giving alms, generosity and respect for monastics. The Buddha became a person to be venerated, and what he actually taught was glossed over.\nThe Buddha’s greatest lay benefactor was Anāthapiṇḍika, the wealthy banker. Indeed, many of the Buddha’s discourses were given at Anāthapiṇḍika’s park (donated to the saṅgha) located at Jeta’s Grove (a famous monastery) in Sāvatthī. There are special sermons composed especially for his benefit. When Anāthapiṇḍika was dying, he summoned the Buddha for the last time, and Sāriputta was sent to visit him. Out of compassion, and wishing Anāthapiṇḍika to be reborn in a higher place, Sāriputta revealed a teaching not normally taught to lay people, and Anāthapiṇḍika exclaimed in surprise in Anāthapiṇḍikovādasutta MN 143 PTS 3.258–3.263:\n15.5 … api ca me dīgharattaṁ satthā payirupāsito manobhāvanīyā ca bhikkhū;\nBut for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed bhikkhus.\n15.6 na ca me evarūpī dhammī kathā sutapubbā”ti.\nYet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talk.”\nBuddhism spread rapidly across India during Asoka’s reign, to Sri Lanka, Burma and eventually to South East Asia. It is remarkable that the structure and lineage of the saṅgha was mostly preserved throughout this process. However, Buddhism also forked into various “sects” and the saṅgha was no longer a unified community. Today, the differences between the sects are such that a reconciliation seems unlikely. Whole books have been written on the reasons and the history of divisions in the way Buddhism is interpreted or practiced that I will not summarise here. Recently, “modern”, “humanistic” and “protestant” versions of Buddhism have surfaced, each with their own adherents.\nHowever, cracks began to appear even during the Buddha’s lifetime. Although the ordaining as a monastic was meant to be a process supporting those who have renounced from worldly life, it became a career option for those who have no soteriological intentions but simply wished to have an “easy” life where they do not need to work, or have any responsibilities, and will be looked after as part of a community.\nAs we saw, monastic life will seem attractive compared to the life of a soldier, or a slave, and no doubt to others wishing to escape or be relieved of ordinary commitments.\nAlthough technically, monastics are not supposed to handle money, earn a living, or own property, the temptation became too much and ways were found circumventing these rules. Generous donations from benefactors include luxury items and property that were granted in perpetuity, so individual monastics had all the benefits of ownership without any of the drawbacks. Even “servants” were “gifted” to monastics, and technically these were slaves. The Buddha himself received the “gift” of hundreds of “servants” from King Bimbisāra - that amounts to an entire village.\nThe benefactor gains merit from the “donation”, the monastic gets free labour - everyone benefits except the poor slave. Even if the monastic then “frees” the slave, both the benefactor and the monastic benefit further from the “merit” of having freed a human being. All the slave got out of that was their freedom, which was their right in the first place.\nPeriodically, there were cries of “corruption” in the saṅgha from these “fake monastics” and ownership of property and human beings. Notably Asoka did a “cleansing purge” of a monastery, and there have been records of periodic cleanses or “purifications” in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand etc. but the problems continue to the present time. The history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Burma in particular appear to be one of decline, revival, amd state control, along with the fortunes of those countries. Even today, genocide and civil wars dominate the recent history of many so called “Buddhist” countries.\nGombrich describes the various issues related to the above in Theravāda Buddhism in chapters 6-8. Similar issues are described for Buddhism in Myanmar by Spiro in Buddhism and society.\nToday the saṅgha survives but is mainly regarded as monastic communities of (primarily) bhikkhus, at least in the Theravadin tradition. The various groups of Theravadan bhikkhunis disappeared and although there are women today who regard themselves as bhikkhunis, wear ochre robes, and adhere to monastic rules (patimokkha), they are not necessarily formally recognised, as a bhikkhuni has to be ordained by other bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and since there are no surviving properly ordained bhikhhunis, no bhikkhuni can be legally ordained, a view that is often criticised and widely debated. Bhikkhunis of other sects still exist, and are formally recognised as such.\nIt is unfortunate that Buddhism died out in India and today is a minority religion in that country, and usually portrayed as a variant of Hinduism. Johannes Bronkhorst in Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism Chapter 3 suggests that Buddhism lost political support compared to brahmanism and over time adopted or adapted to brahmanism practices. I venture to suppose that a desire to portray Buddhism in a favourable light compared to brahmanism potentially was one of the main reasons why the texts were altered and expanded as we saw earlier in the article. The main soteriological basis of Buddha’s teachings became obscured by passages extolling and exalting the Buddha, emphasising his supernatural skills and powers, and brahmanism practices were incorporated in the texts to demonstrate the Buddhism was at least comparable in stature. The volume of material expanded considerably to demonstrate the depth of Buddha’s teachings, even though the core messages were actually relatively concise. Increasinglly, verse was used to convey abstract concepts, again possibly to convey depth and mysticism, even though the Buddha himself advised against using verse. In Khuddakavatthukkhandhaka Kd 15 PTS 2.105–2.145 33.1.13 the Buddha states:\n33.1.13 “na, bhikkhave, buddhavacanaṁ chandaso āropetabbaṁ.\n“You shouldn’t give metrical form to the word of the Buddha.\n33.1.14 Yo āropeyya, āpatti dukkaṭassa.\nIf you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.\n33.1.15 Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, sakāya niruttiyā buddhavacanaṁ pariyāpuṇitun”ti.\nYou should learn the word of the Buddha using its own expressions.”\nDhammapada became a popular text, as people are drawn by the inherent beauty of the verse and the metaphors, even though the actual content can be rather opaque (and, I mentioned earlier, can reflect non-Buddhist origins). And thus we come full circle: the very practices and beliefs that the Buddha would have refuted have gradually seeped into and have become part of buddhavacana.\nThe failure of Buddishm Some Buddhist practitioners and scholars believe that sometime after the 1st century CE the Buddha’s teachings became no longer effective and practitioners were no longer able to achieve enlightenment. The last known arahant (enlightened being) lived around that time.\nAccording to Gombrich in p. 168n of Theravāda Buddhism:\nIn Sinhalese public opinion there seem always to have been two conflicting views about the state of the Sāsana. The view that it is in decline goes back, we saw, to the Buddha himself. There is a popular tradition in Sri Lanka that the last Enlightened person in the country died in the first century BCE. On the other hand, the Pali commentaries and chronicles both state and imply that ancient Ceylon was full of Enlightened monks. There are even anecdotes about how people tested or contested claims to sainthood. Curious laymen devised little ruses to see whether an alleged saint took fright easily or salivated at the sight of food. A major component of the popular image of the saint was that he controlled his body and always preserved decorum. Rahula sums up his fascinating chapter on this topic by saying that saints ‘were evidently not expected to be entirely free from . . . minor blemishes, such as pride and love of display’, but ‘should have a reputation for deep piety and scrupulousness in observing the precepts’ – and miraculous powers were a bonus. I doubt whether expectations are very different today.\nAccording to Jayarava in Why Did Buddhists Abandon Buddhavacana?:\nAs far as I can see, all Buddhist sects gradually moved away from buddhavacana and adopted novel doctrines over time. Even the venerable Theravāda tradition — whose own mythology includes the claim to have preserved the entire oeuvre of the Buddha in the very language that he spoke — moved substantially away from those texts. Modern Theravāda is actually based on the writings of Buddhaghosa, a fifth century commentator, and on medieval sub-commentaries on Abhidhamma, such as the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha. The practice of meditation died out in Theravāda sects and had to be reinvented in the eighteenth century. Indeed, some Theravādins have argued that liberation from rebirth is impossible in the absence of a living Buddha.\nToday there are no known living arahants, or even known arahants in recent memory. Some have claimed they are arahants but not generally accepted, others have been suspected or assumed to be arahants, and there may be arahants who have not declared themselves and are therefore unknown.\nBuddhism as a religion includes beliefs, customs and practices that were not taught or endorsed by the Buddha. These are documented by Gombrich in Theravāda Buddhism: A social history from ancient Benares to modern Colombo and Spiro in Buddhism and society : a great tradition and its Burmese vicissitudes.\nBuddhism today is divided into various sects, and the beliefs of the sects do not always overlap. There are also modern forms of Buddhism which may or may not incorporate all the “original” teachings of the Buddha. Some have replaced Buddha’s teachings, and sometimes even the Buddha himself, with “newer” and “improved” teachings.\nBuddhism is primarily practised by the various sects and groups of monastics (who do not always agree with each other), or by “lay disciples.” The major sects all have their own version of the Buddhist teachings, with some considerable differences between them.\nThere were issues with quarrels and bad behaviour even during Buddha’s lifetime. Take, for example Ovādasutta SN 16.6 PTS 2.204–2.205, where Kassapa complains to the Buddha that lately monks have become hard to admonish, impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully, requiring an intervention by the Buddha:\n2.1 “Dubbacā kho, bhante, etarahi bhikkhū, dovacassakaraṇehi dhammehi samannāgatā, akkhamā, appadakkhiṇaggāhino anusāsaniṁ.\n“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.”\n2.2 Idhāhaṁ, bhante, addasaṁ bhaṇḍañca nāma bhikkhuṁ ānandassa saddhivihāriṁ abhijikañca nāma bhikkhuṁ anuruddhassa saddhivihāriṁ aññamaññaṁ sutena accāvadante: ‘ehi, bhikkhu, ko bahutaraṁ bhāsissati, ko sundarataraṁ bhāsissati, ko cirataraṁ bhāsissatī’”ti.\n“Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?”\nEven the Buddha noticed that his teachings became less effective over time, due to internal corruption within the Saṅgha. Kassapa asked the Buddha why there are now fewer enlightened beings, but more disciplinary rules. The Buddha replied that the overall quality of members of the community have declined and some don’t respect the teachings or the teacher (Saddhammappatirūpakasutta SN 16.13 PTS 2.224–2.225):\n4.3 Idha, kassapa, bhikkhū bhikkhuniyo upāsakā upāsikāyo satthari agāravā viharanti appatissā, dhamme agāravā viharanti appatissā, saṅghe agāravā viharanti appatissā, sikkhāya agāravā viharanti appatissā, samādhismiṁ agāravā viharanti appatissā\nIt’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion.\nThe arch-nemesis during Buddha’s lifetime was no doubt Devadatta, who tried to take over the community, caused a formal schism in the Saṅgha, and even tried unsuccessfully to kill the Buddha in Saṁghabhedakakkhandhaka Kd 17 PTS 2.180–2.206\nGiven the “schism” of Buddhism into various sects, the potential “corruption” in the Buddha’s teachings, and the fact that there are no known living arahants, I have to reluctantly conclude Buddhism is a failed religion, since it is no longer effective by the very standards it sets.\nA New Approach So, what is the path forward? Is there a way to “rediscover” the original intent and teachings of the Buddha, or are we doomed to wait for the “next” Buddha, who may not appear for thousands of years?\nIn the pages of this website, I hope to document my journey towards my quest to truly understand what the Buddha really taught, and use that as a basis for my own “salvation”, or freedom from suffering and craving.\nAt this point, a question could reasonably be asked: Isn’t this a “scorched earth” approach, and ignores all the effort made by others to date? Surely I am not conceited enough to believe I am superior to all present and past teachers, that I am going to discover something that existing research have not already uncovered?\nIndeed, it is a good question and one I have asked myself many times. I don’t believe I am superior to others, and acknowledge many seem to have far more knowledge and experience than myself. There is an extensive amount of research and translations available today, and yes I have read some of them. Indeed, in preparing this article, I feel I am “standing on the shoulders of giants” and very much relying on the expertise of many people: Walpoul Rahula, Richard Gombrich, Grzegorz Polak, Mark Allon, Johannes Bronkhorst, Bhikkhu Anālayo, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Bhante Sujato amongst others to name a few.\nWhy not just rely on their authority, and also the experience of many well known Buddhist practitioners today? That would be nice, except they don’t all agree with each other. Even prominent Buddhist bhikkhus and teachers don’t always share the same views, and it is all too easy to find disagreements and debates in various discussion forums on the Internet. And since none of them have declared that they have attained enlightenment (indeed, by Vinaya rules they are not allowed to), then it is impossible to determine who is right and who is … well … less right.\nTherefore, I believe it is still valuable to go through this process of rediscovery, mainly because for me to truly realise what the Buddha taught, I need to be able to digest, conceptualise and synthesise what I have read in my own terms.\nAn excerpt from the Foreword of Sujato’s book A History of Mindfulness may help clarify my motivation. Note, I have paraphrased the excerpt to make it more applicable to my situation, my replacements are in parentheses:\nAn aspiring (student) first learns from the lips of a teacher whose words as they utter them must be the very latest formulation of the topic. Then they might go back to read some of the works of well-known contemporary teachers. Since devotees usually have faith that their teacher (or the teacher’s teacher) was enlightened, they assume, often without reflection, that the teachings must be in accord with the Buddha. Finally, if they are really dedicated, they may go back to read (the actual teachings). Once they come to the text itself, they are already pre-programmed to read the text in a certain way. It takes guts to question one’s teachers; and it takes not just guts, but time and effort to question intelligently.\nAnd therefore the approach:\nOur first step must be to forget all we’ve learnt about (the Buddha’s teachings), and to start again from the bottom up. A basic principle of the historical method is that simpler teachings tend to be earlier and hence are likely to be more authentic​ - w​e must start with the bricks before we can build a house. It is the shorter, more basic, passages that are the most fundamental presentation of (the Buddha’s teachings). The longer texts are an elaboration. We do not assume that shorter is always earlier, but we take this as a guiding principle whose implications we can follow through.\nPolak further clarifies in Reexamining Jhana: Towards a Critical Reconstruction of Early Buddhist Soteriology p. 216:\nSimilarly to Sujato, I too believe that proper justification and motivation for critical studies of early Buddhism can only be provided by a pragmatic and existential approach.\n… Buddhism easily stands out as probably the least dogmatic and the least difficult to harmonize with the scientific worldview. It possesses some apparent flaws, a dose of internal discrepancies, some question marks and we can also encounter some problems connected to its history. These problems certainly would put Buddhism on the edge of being immediately disqualified as the ‘ultimate solution’, were it not for a fascinating perspective of some deeply hidden nucleus, possibly devoid of these flaws. This perspective is provided by the presence of some fundamental internal discrepancies within the Buddhist doctrine, which suggest that some process of evolution of the original doctrine must have occurred, during which the above-mentioned discrepancies made their way into the Buddhist writings. In this way, a critical research of this problem becomes a life’s necessity. It is no longer the case of us trying to find motivation and then justification for this activity, as the questions ‘why should we?’, and ‘do we have right to?’ get transformed to ‘how can we allow ourselves not to?’.\nThe Buddha himself advocated that his disciples should not to accept any teaching merely on a teacher’s authority, but to work things out for themselves and use common sense in Kesamuttisutta AN 3.65 PTS 1.189–1.193:\n4.1 … mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu,　mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.\n… don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’\nAssumptions First of all, I assume that at least some of Buddha’s teachings have been accurately preserved in the Tipiṭaka, otherwise there is no hope of rediscovering what they were. This is in accordance with the main conclusions from the book The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts. I also have to assume that at one stage the teachings must have been effective, otherwise Buddhism as a religion would have failed a long time ago and we will not know of it today. The Buddha was not omniscient, even after enlightenment. Although he no doubt had a penetrating intellect and a compassionate personality, he is not able to foretell the future, read people’s minds (although he shown to be a good judge of character and understands people well). He does occasionally make mistakes, so we should not assume that he is always correct or his teaching is necessarily the absolute truth. Therefore, I assume that Buddhism is no longer effective because the teachings have been corrupted and misinterpreted, but if we can rediscover what the original teachings may have been, then they will be effective. I also believe that the original teachings are completely integrated and self-consistent, so the key to rediscovering Buddha’s teachings is to find an internally coherent and interlocking subset. The core teachings of Buddhism should not require a belief in supernatural powers, the different planes of existence, various deities, etc. I am not saying that these do not exist, but the Buddha made it clear that his teachings were sufficient and don’t require speculation on concepts or entities that are unknowable. We also don’t really need to know the details of Buddha’s life, or past lives, entertaining though they may be. So we can set aside any elements from teachings that reference these, and save them for bedtime reading. Principles Question and evaluate everything: do not assume a teaching is correct unless it appears to make sense, or can be directly experienced, and is consistent with other teachings that have been previously validated as true. It is possible to apply rational or logical thinking to evaluate the suttas. It does not necessarily require leaps of faith. The simplest possible version of a teaching is likely to be the correct one, or at least the least corrupted. It appears that the tendency is for the suttas to be added to rather than redacted, since the monks that preserved them were keen not to eliminate any of Buddha’s teachings, but apparently believe enhancing them through pericopes (filling out a teaching with stock phrases) is acceptable. If two teachings differ because one appears to be a superset of the other, accept the smaller teaching as a hypothesis for the correct set. The larger set is assumed to be due to a later addition. Minimum viable proposition: the teachings of the Buddha should be distilled to a core, internally consistent, set which is deemed to be just sufficient to achieve enlightenment. The Tipiṭaka has a lot of repetitions and redundancy, these can be simplified. All teachings must be evaluated. Do not selectively cherry pick some teachings and disregard others. It is tempting to focus only on the well known and popular suttas, but it is possible some of the more esoteric or difficult to interpret suttas may be more accurate. Where possible, evaluate the teaching based on the Pāli text and not an English translation. In particular, retain the Pāli words for any technical terms. Reject any teachings not related to the core soteriology. In particular, anything to do with the various heavens and hells, deities, supernatural powers or attainments, etc. This is a fairly innocuous principle to follow regardless whether one believes in supernatural powers or not, since if one manages to achieve enlightenment, then any supernatural powers that may be gained are irrelevant anyway. In Susimaparibbājakasutta SN 12.70 PTS 2.120–2.128 reaching enlightenment is described as being possible without the acquisition of psychic powers (anekavihitaṁ iddhividhaṁ), divine clairaudience (dibbāya sotadhātuyā visuddhāya), read minds, recall past lives (anekavihitaṁ pubbenivāsaṁ anussaratha), claivoyance (dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena), or even the formless meditative practices. Set aside any teachings relating to Buddhism as a religion - rules and prohibitions, customs, sociology etc. Many of these are probably late additions or irrelevant to soteriology. In addition, Johannes Bronkhorst proposes a method to arrive at the teaching of the Buddha on the basis of the early canonical texts in Early Buddhist Meditation, a paper presented at the conference “Buddhist Meditation from Ancient India to Modern Asia”, Jogye Order International Conference Hall, Seoul, 29 November 2012:\nPut very briefly, the teaching of the Buddha as presented in the early canon contains a number of contradictions. There are views and practices that are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected. The method I have proposed is based on a study of other religious movements that are known to have existed at the time of the Buddha in the same region of India. It turns out that among the views and practices that are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon many are also found in those other religious movements. We are therefore entitled to suspect that Buddhism, in the course of its development but before the final redaction of its early canon, underwent the influence of those movements and borrowed some of their views and practices. My proposal is to consider views and practices in the Buddhist canon as borrowings, and therefore as non-authentic, if two criteria are met: (1) they are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon, and (2) they have their place in the other religious movements of the time. I also submit that the original teaching of the Buddha may have to be looked for among the views and practices that remain after deduction of the borrowings.\nEven more importantly, the Buddha himself advised an approach to determine whether a teaching is authentic or not, which he repeated four times in Catumahāpadesakathā (the four great references) from Mahāparinibbānasutta DN 16 PTS 2.72–2.168:\n4.8.1 “Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṁ vadeyya:\n“Take a bhikkhu who says:\n4.8.2 ‘sammukhā metaṁ, āvuso, bhagavato sutaṁ sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ,\nFriend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:\n4.8.3 ayaṁ dhammo ayaṁ vinayo idaṁ satthusāsanan’ti.\nthis is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’\n4.8.4 Tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno bhāsitaṁ neva abhinanditabbaṁ nappaṭikkositabbaṁ.\nYou should neither approve nor dismiss that bhikkhu’s statement.\n4.8.5 Anabhinanditvā appaṭikkositvā tāni padabyañjanāni sādhukaṁ uggahetvā sutte osāretabbāni, vinaye sandassetabbāni.\nInstead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.\n4.8.6 Tāni ce sutte osāriyamānāni vinaye sandassiyamānāni na ceva sutte osaranti, na ca vinaye sandissanti, niṭṭhamettha gantabbaṁ:\nIf they do not fit in the discourse and are not exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:\n4.8.7 ‘addhā idaṁ na ceva tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ;\n‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha.\n4.8.8 imassa ca bhikkhuno duggahitan’ti.\nIt has been incorrectly memorized by that bhikkhu.’\n4.8.9 Iti hetaṁ, bhikkhave, chaḍḍeyyātha.\nAnd so you should reject it.\n4.8.10 Tāni ce sutte osāriyamānāni vinaye sandassiyamānāni sutte ceva osaranti, vinaye ca sandissanti, niṭṭhamettha gantabbaṁ:\nIf they do fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion: 4.8.11 ‘addhā idaṁ tassa bhagavato vacanaṁ;\n‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha.\n4.8.12 imassa ca bhikkhuno suggahitan’ti.\nIt has been correctly memorized by that bhikkhu.’\nProcess How to begin?\nSujato created a hypothesis on the origin and development of the Buddhist texts called ‘General Integrated Sutta Theory’ (GIST) in the book A History of Mindfulness p. 19. It “… encompasses the entire gamut of extant early scriptures, that is, the Suttas, Vinayas, and Abhidhammas of all the schools preserved in Pali, Chinese, and various Indic dialects” and presents essential relations between these texts. According to this, the following constitute the earliest strata of Buddhist texts:\nEarliest Discourses: Dhammacakkappavattana, Anattalakkhaṇa, and Ādittapariyāya Suttas, and the Request of Brahmā. Earliest Collection: Congruent sections of Saṁyutta Nikāya/Saṁyukta Āgama. Earliest Abhidhamma: Congruent sections of Vibhaṅga/Dharmaskandha/Śāriputrābhidharma. According this, we should start by examining the earliest discourses as well as the Saṁyutta Nikāya. I will only examine the Pali version, since I can read Pali but not Chinese. Sujato suggests that the topics in the Saṁyutta Nikāya are fairly congruent across the various schools and are expositions of the Four Noble Truths, with the following relationships between the topics, the collection in the Saṁyuttanikāya SN, the section in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga Vb, and finally individual suttas:\n# Discourses ## Truths ### [Saccasaṁyutta SN 56](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn56) #### [Saccavibhaṅga Vb 4 PTS 99–121](https://suttacentral.net/vb4) - MN 141 - MA 31 - EA 27.1 ## Aggregates ### [Khandhasaṁyutta SN 22](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-khandhavaggasamyutta/sn22) #### [Khandhavibhaṅga Vb 1 PTS 1–69](https://suttacentral.net/vb1) - SN 22.59 - SA 34) ## Sense bases ### [Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta SN 35](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn35) #### [Āyatanavibhaṅga Vb 2 PTS 70–81](https://suttacentral.net/vb2) ### [Dhātusaṁyutta SN 14](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn14) #### [Dhātuvibhaṅga Vb 3 PTS 82–98](https://suttacentral.net/vb3) - MN 115 - MA 181 - MN 141 - MA 162 ### [Vedanāsaṁyutta SN 36](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn36) ## Origin ### [Nidānasaṁyutta SN 12](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn12) #### [Paṭiccasamuppādavibhaṅga Vb 6 PTS 135–192](https://suttacentral.net/vb6) - SN 12.2 - SA 298 ## Defilements ### [Diṭṭhisaṁyutta SN 24](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn45) #### [Khuddakavatthuvibhaṅga Vb 17 PTS 345–400](https://suttacentral.net/vb17) - SA 4 ### (Kamma) #### (Kamma) - SA 41 ## Cessation ### [Asaṅkhatasaṁyutta SN 43](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn43) #### (Nibbāna) ### [Sotāpattisaṁyutta SN 55](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn55) - SA 30 ## 8-fold path ### [Maggasaṁyutta SN 45](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn45) #### [Maggaṅgavibhaṅga Vb 11 PTS 235–243](https://suttacentral.net/vb11) - SN 45.8 - SA 783 ### [Satipaṭṭhānasaṁyutta SN 47](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-mahavaggasamyutta/sn47) #### [Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga Vb 7 PTS 193–207](https://suttacentral.net/vb7) - MN 10 - MA 98 - EA 12.1 ### [Sammappadhānasaṁyutta SN 49](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn49) #### [Sammappadhānavibhaṅga Vb 8 PTS 208–215](https://suttacentral.net/vb8) - SN 49 ### [Iddhipādasaṁyutta SN 51](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn51) #### [Iddhipādavibhaṅga Vb 9 PTS 216–226](https://suttacentral.net/vb9) - SN 51.13 ### [Indriyasaṁyutta SN 48](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn48) #### [Indriyavibhaṅga Vb 5 PTS 122–134](https://suttacentral.net/vb5) ### [Balasaṁyutta SN 50](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn50) ### [Bojjhaṅgasaṁyutta SN 46](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn46) - AN 5.14 - AN 5.15 - SA 675 #### [Bojjhaṅgavibhaṅga Vb 10 PTS 227–234](https://suttacentral.net/vb10) - SN 46.3 - SA 736 - SA 740 - SA 724 - SN 46.5 - SA 733 ### [Jhānasaṁyutta SN 34](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta/linked/sn/sn-nidanavaggasamyutta/sn34) #### [Jhānavibhaṅga Vb 12 PTS 244–271](https://suttacentral.net/vb12) - SA 29 #### [Appamaññāvibhaṅga Vb 13 PTS 272–284](https://suttacentral.net/vb13) #### [Sikkhāpadavibhaṅga Vb 14 PTS 285–292](https://suttacentral.net/vb14) There is also a classification of the Buddha’s teachings into 9 sections (navaṅga). These nine categories are based on content, structure or literary style:\nSutta (Sūtra[S]): prose discourses, especially short declarative discourses. Refers primarily to the early portions of the Thera/Therīgāthā and the Sutta Nipāta Geyya (Geya[S]): mixed prose and verse discourse. Identified with the Sagāthāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya Veyyakarana (Vyākarana[S]): explanation, analysis. Discourses in question and answer format. Gāthā: verse Udāna: inspired speech. Eg, Dhammapāda and the Udāna Itivuttaka (Ityukta[S]): fables, eg. Itivuttaka Jātaka: story of a previous life of the Buddha Abbhutadhamma (Abhutadharma[S]): concerning wonders and miraculous events, eg. Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta (MN 123/MA 32), the Bakkula Sutta (MN 124/MA 34) Vedalla (Vaipulya[S]) either ’extended discourses’ or ’those giving joy’ (cf Mahayana Texts) eg. MN 43/MA 211, MN 44/MA 44 According to this classification, the suttas in the four Nikāyas can usually be classified into the top 3:\nSutta Vyākaraṇa Geyya Content Basic doctrinal statements Detailed exposition Inspirational/devotional Style Declarative prose Interrogative prose Mixed prose and verse Speaker The Buddha only The Buddha and/or disciples The Buddha, disciples, and others Context Always monastic Usually monastic Usually with lay people or deities, often Brahmanical Paradigm Dhammacakkappavattana Anattalakkhaṇa Request of Brahmā Based on the above, we will focus on Sutta and Vyākaraṇa discourses in the Nikāyas in the following order:\nSaṁyutta Nikāya (SN) Majjhima Nikāya (MN) Dīgha Nikāya (DN) Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN) We will set aside the discourses outside the four main collections for the time being. Joy Manné proposes in Categories Of Sutta In The Pali Nikayas And Their Implications For Our Appreciation Of The Buddhist Teaching And Literature, Journal of the Pali Text Society, XV, 29-87, that “each of the first four Nikāyas came about in order to serve a distinct need and purpose in the growing and developing Buddhist community” (p. 73).\nDN was primarily intended for the purpose of propaganda, to attract converts to the new religion, and thus is aimed mainly at non-Buddhists favourably disposed to Buddhism; MN, in contrast, was directed inwards towards the Buddhist community and its purpose was to extol the Master (both as a real person and as an archetype) and to integrate monks into the community and the practice.\nBhikkhu Bodhi hypothesises in The Connected Discourses of the Buddha p. 32 that:\n… the suttas in SN (as also in AN) were, as a general rule, not targetted at outsiders or even at the newly converted, but were intended principally for those who had already turned for refuge to the Dhamma and were deeply immersed in its study and practice. … SN was compiled to serve as the repository for the many short but pithy suttas disclosing the Buddha’s radical insights into the nature of reality and his unique path to spiritual emancipation.\nWe notice, particularly in SN but generally across all the collections, is there is a pattern in the way suttas are organised in a collection. As noticed by Mark Allon in p. 27, suttas in a collection are grouped:\n… on the basis of genre, size, purpose, a numerical principle, subject matter, and so on. The textual units within these larger collections were further organized into more manageable sub-divisions, such as vagga/vargas, saṃyutta/saṃyuktas, and nipātas, and then, in the case of sutra collections, into the most basic grouping of the vagga/varga that consists ideally of ten sutras, the number ten perhaps being influenced by the fact that we have ten fingers. The larger collection was also sometimes divided into bhāṇavāras, or recitation sections, where a bhāṇavāra is said to consist of 8,000 akṣaras or syllables.47 Yet another system of organization occasionally used for large collections was to arrange the member sutras into groups of 50, or paññāsakas, a system used to group the 152 suttas of the Majjhima- nikāya into three paññāsakas48 and for structuring the suttas of the large Khandha- and Saḷāyatana-saṃyuttas of the Saṃyutta-nikāya and those in Books 2 to 10 (Duka- to Dasaka-nipāta) of the Aṅguttara-nikāya. A further set of organizational principles was then used to guide the inclusion and arrangement of textual units within these secondary and tertiary divisions. This included genre, size, whether verse was included and how many verses were involved, subject matter, a numerical feature, a connection based on a key word or words, or key concepts, the manner of treating a topic, including its treatment in brief and in expanded form, the individuals involved, such as who delivered the discourse or spoke the verses or the one to whom they were addressed, the location of events depicted, and figures of speech such as a simile or metaphor, to mention only the main ones.\nIn SN, suttas are often arranged by:\ntopic (subject matter or keyword), groups of individuals, eg. deities, kings, monks, ascetics, a shared literary feature or figure of speech, pairs of textual units or occasionally longer runs Finally, after reading and the suttas, one should internally understanding the true meaning and underlying key concepts, after which the suttas themselves do not need to be memorised or even retained in their current form. I try to summarise buddhavacana on this website through diagrams and tables, and very rarely translate or quote entire suttas. This is based on advice from the Buddha himself in the Simile of the Raft, contained in Alagaddūpamasutta MN 22\nIn Conclusion Some of you may have noticed the structure of this article somewhat mirrors the Buddha’s Four Pure Truths:\nI started by describing who the Buddha was and summarising what he taught. I then described how his teachings have transformed over the years, to the point where I believe they are no longer effective. I describe the need to rediscover what his teachings were, so that they can be effective. Finally, I outline an approach by which the Buddha’s teachings can be rediscovered. This article and this website will continually evolve as I progress along on my journey of rediscovery and ultimately awakening.\nAfterword The Buddha, whether he truly existed or was a composite of various people, revolutionalised soteriology, by removing the necessity for elements such as gods, heavens, souls, supernatural powers, cosmology, omniscience, or any other thing that cannot be directly experienced, although he never explicitly denied any of the above.\nInstead, he blended the Vedic concepts of rebirth, cycle of existence, and cessation of desire as the key to liberation, together with the Jain concepts of the sanctity of all life and self control. He crafted a “middle” path that avoided extremities of belief or actions. His key innovations were the ethicisation of kamma and linking it to suffering and the cycle of existence, showing us our “consciousness” is nothing more than the results of our desires and cravings, and recognising that ultimately everything we experience is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and does not support the concept of an eternal soul. His most misunderstood concepts are his descriptions of enlightenment and meditation, which confuses people even today.\nUltimately, his teachings can be distilled to very simple ideas: eliminate craving and desire and other unwholesome or unskillful thoughts, be the best person one can possibly be, have a calm and dispassionate disposition, have a positive attitude towards life and other living beings, and you will be forever be rid of sufffering and dissatisfaction. Even if one does not believe in anything he taught, is there nothing better than to follow that path?\nThe Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050 Pew Research Center’s Religion \u0026 Public Life Project. ↩︎\nReligious affiliation in Australia ↩︎\nTheravāda Buddhism The Social Conditions Of His Day pp. 49-56. Interestingly, Johannes Bronkhorst in Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism presents a counter-opinion, that “the Brahmins, did not occupy a dominant position in the area in which the Buddha preached his message” and that Brahmanism didn’t really spread until after the reign of Asoka. This would imply all the brahmanical references found in the Tipiṭaka must be from a later period when Buddhism found itself in competition with Brahmanism. ↩︎\nTheravāda Buddhism To whom did the Buddha’s message appeal? pp. 56-60 ↩︎\nMahāparinibbānasutta DN 16 PTS 2.72–2.168 35.

The PED describes the Buddhist use of the word as “… an ethical state, to be reached in this birth by ethical practices, contemplation and insight. It is therefore not transcendental.”\nHowever, over time the interpretation of the word became more and more complex. The following are excerpts from the PED (some text have been elided for simplicity):\nnibbāna is the untranslatable expression of the Unspeakable, of that for which in the Buddha’s own saying there is no word, which cannot be grasped in terms of reasoning and cool logic, the Nameless Undefinable (cp. the simile of extinction of the flame) which may be said to pass from a visible state into a state which cannot be defined. Thus the Saint (Arahant) passes into that same state, for which there is “no measure” (i.e. no dimension) […]. Yet, it is a reality, and its characteristic features may be described, may be grasped in terms of earthly language, in terms of space (as this is the only means at our disposal to describe abstract notions of time and mentality) […] It is the speculative, scholastic view and the dogmatising trend of later times, beginning with the Abhidhamma period which has more and more developed the simple, spontaneous idea into an exaggerated form either to the positive (i.e. seeing in nibbāna a definite; state or sphere of existence) or the negative side (i.e. seeing in it a condition of utter annihilation). Yet its sentimental value to the (exuberant optimism of the) early Buddhists (Rh. Davids, Early Buddhism, p. 73) is one of peace and rest, perfect passionlessness, and thus supreme happiness. According to the New Concise Pali-English dictionary, nibbāna is:\nthe ceasing to burn, going out. freedom from care or passion, a sense of bodily well-being; ease, happiness. the ceasing to burn, going out (of the fires of passion etc); the ceasing, coming to an end, of all that furnishes fuel for rebirth; the end of the possibility of rebirth; freedom from all concerns and passions; the sense of well-being, ease, happiness, experienced through the knowledge of this freedom in oneself. How did the Buddha use the term nibbāna I searched for the term in the Tripiṭaka, and I found the following suttas either directly or indirectly describing nibbāna:\nNibbānasutta AN 6.101 PTS 3.443 defines nibbāna as neither dukkhato (pain) nor sukhato (pleasure) Nibbānasutta AN 7.19 PTS 4.15 describes the “happiness” observed, perceived and experienced by one who is enlightened (Nibbāne sukhānupassī viharati sukhasaññī sukhapaṭisaṁvedī) Note that in here “happiness” (sukhaṁ) is not necessarily an emotion but can be satisfaction with having achieved something (api ca, āvuso, yattha yattha sukhaṁ upalabbhati yahiṁ yahiṁ taṁ taṁ tathāgato sukhasmiṁ paññapetī) Bahuvedanīyasutta MN 59 PTS 1.397–1.400 Nibbānasukhasutta AN 9.34 PTS 4.415–4.418 explains nibbāna can also be considered to be “bliss” (sukhamidaṁ) in the same manner. Nirāmisasutta SN 36.31 PTS 4.236–4.238 additional terms that can be used, including “joy” (pīti), “equanimity” (upekkhā) and release (vimokkho) that can be “more spiritual” than the ones “of the flesh” (nirāmisā nirāmisatarā) Nibbānasutta AN 9.48 PTS 4.454 says that nibbāna is achievable in the current life (Sandiṭṭhikaṁ nibbānaṁ) Paṭhamanibbānapaṭisaṁyuttasutta Ud 8.1 PTS 80 describes nibbāna as a string of negatives: not of the earth, water, fire or wind (neva pathavī, na āpo, na tejo, na vāyo), nor in the infinity of space, consciousness, nothingness or neither perception or non perception (na ākāsānañcāyatanaṁ, na viññāṇañcāyatanaṁ, na ākiñcaññāyatanaṁ, na nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṁ), not the world, the world beyond, the sun or the moon (nāyaṁ loko, na paraloko, na ubho candimasūriyā). Furthermore, it does not come, or go, or stay still, or die, or come into existence, or rest, or fall, or has a basis (neva āgatiṁ vadāmi, na gatiṁ, na ṭhitiṁ, na cutiṁ, na upapattiṁ; appatiṭṭhaṁ, appavattaṁ, anārammaṇamevetaṁ). Dutiyanibbānapaṭisaṁyuttasutta Ud 8.2 PTS Ud 80 PTS Ud 80 Verse 86 says it is hard to comprehend anataṁ (endless and boundless) but for those that have comprehended and understood craving, nothing can be seen (passato natthi kiñcanaṁ). Tatiyanibbānapaṭisaṁyuttasutta Ud 8.3 PTS 81 says “not-born, non-existing, not made, not caused” (atthi ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṅkhataṁ). This phrase also crops up in other places, such as Iti43. Nibbānadhātusutta Iti 44 PTS 39 PTS 39 Verse 83–84 states there are two “facets” or types of nibbāna: after achieving it and is still living (saupādisesā nibbānadhātu), and after one passes away (anupādisesā nibbānadhātu) Catutthanibbānapaṭisaṁyuttasutta Ud 8.4 PTS Ud 81 expresses the “end of suffering” (esevanto dukkhassa) as the lack of attachment to agitation (calitaṁ). When there is no agitation, there is tranquility (passaddhi), no inclination (nati), no coming and coming (āgatigati), no dying and rebirth (cutūpapāto), not in here, another world, or in between. From this, one can surmise nibbāna is neither pleasurable nor painful (although one can observe, perceive and experience “bliss”, “happiness”, “joy”, “equanimity” or “release” in the knowledge that one has attained enlightenment), and it not material, or immaterial, or various states of existence, or endless/boundless, does not get made, or born, or caused, and is not of this world or any other.\nAnd yet nibbāna as a “concept” (nibbānadhātu) remains even after an enlightened one dies (anupādisesā nibbānadhātu). This is difficult to reconcile with the above view, and raises the troublesome question of “what exists after the death of an enlightened being” which Buddha has refused to answer.\nSamādhisutta AN 10.6 PTS 5.8 (as well as similar wordings in AN3.32, AN10.7, AN10.60 etc.) describes “the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation” as “peaceful, and sublime” (etaṁ santaṁ etaṁ paṇītaṁ yadidaṁ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhākkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānan). So it seems this is a “stock phrase” or pericope, possibly inserted at a later stage.\n# SN 12.70 - khīṇā jāti - vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ - kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ - nāparaṁ itthattāyāti pajānāma The Buddha warned in Mūlapariyāyasutta MN 1 PTS 1.1–1.6 that those who have not “directly experienced” nibbāna may not understand it completely and hence develop wrong views:\n‘Apariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi. Nibbānaṁ nibbānato sañjānāti; nibbānaṁ nibbānato saññatvā nibbānaṁ maññati, nibbānasmiṁ maññati, nibbānato maññati, nibbānaṁ meti maññati, nibbānaṁ abhinandati.`\nWhat is process of enlightenment The moment of enlightenment is a liberating insight from someone who is conscious and aware, not someone in a deep meditative state, absorption or altered state of consciousness. This is evidenced by the Buddha’s early disciples. This includes the five ascetics (Kondañña, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahānāma, and Assaji), Yasa and his 54 friends, the 30 men on the way to Uruvelā, the Kassapa brothers and their 1000 disciples, and eventually Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the two famous disciples. From the stories of these early converts and their attainment of enlightenment, it seems all of them did so relatively quickly, after hearing and understanding the Buddha’s teachings, and apparently without practising or entering in any of the jhāna states.\nFrom this we can conclude enlightenment is something that is achievable in one lifetime (provided one is receptive and ready), and apparently after hearing the Buddha speak just once or soon thereafter, and does not require supernormal powers or deep meditation skills.\nThe simplest possible explanation of nibbāna is that it is the satisfaction and sense of achievement that comes from understanding the Buddha’s teachings, successfully conquering and controlling the khandhas resulting in the extinction of unwholesome intentions and thoughts. Therefore kamma will gradually subside and death will no longer result in rebirth.\nThere is no requirement to believe that it is some sort of other-worldly or supramundane state, or that the achiever will develop supernatural powers or become omniscient, although those attainments are not ruled out, if they exist.\nthe depiction of the Buddha’s own attainment of the absorp- tions and of his insight into the four noble truths 114\nAccording to the Aṅguttara-nikāya discourse, what enabled the Buddha to progress from the first absorption to the second was the overcoming of vitarka and vicāra, and further progress to the higher absorp- tions took place by leaving behind first rapture and then happiness. The description confirms that, even in the case of the Buddha himself, basic awareness of the factors specific to a particular absorption was consid- ered a sufficient degree of analysis for practical purposes. This was enough to enable him to recognize clearly the factors that are to be cul- tivated and those that need to be left behind in order to attain a higher absorption. Analayo 112\nPlacing the descriptions of the Buddha’s own progress to awakening alongside the Anupada-sutta and the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna-sutta reveals a trajectory that leads from a relatively basic and straightforward ap- proach to detailed analyses concerned with minute details. While the employment of analysis in itself is an integral part of early Buddhist thought, the tendency for analysis to expand its scope and proliferate points to the emerging Abhidharma. 116\nit lies in the attempt to be as detailed and com- prehensive as possible. Once the task is no longer just to point out the way, but rather to provide a complete map of the whole territory to be traversed, there is inevitably a danger that the actual road to be taken might become buried under the amount of details provided. p117\nNibbāna is achievable to anyone who is willing to detach from and renounce the sensory world and cravings, who has the capacity to understand Buddha’s teachings, and has the mental strength and focus to manage the khandhas. It does not require taking vows, joining the sangha and being ordained, wearing robes and receiving alms, practising deep meditative states or any of the other customs, rituals and practices associated with Buddhism as a religion. It does require wisdom, compassion, and other positive attributes and a sense of calmness, equanimity and focus.\nAfter attaining enlightenment, arahants continued their existence and live out the remainder of their natural lives as mendicants engaging in daily activities.\nHow do we know when someone has reached Nibbāna According to Chabbisodhanasutta MN 112 PTS 3.30–3.37. If someone claims to be awakened, their claim should be interrogated with a series of questions. Only if they can answer them clearly should the claim be accepted.\nThe questions and accepted answers are merely going through a list of the Buddha’s core teachings and finally declaring that one has lived in accordance to those teachings:\ncatūsu vohāresu (four kinds of expressions) pañcupādānakkhandhā (five aggregates) cha dhātuyo (6 elements) cha ajjhattikabāhirāni āyatanāni (6 interior and exterior sense fields) saviññāṇake kāye bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā samūhatā (eradicated ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli) If the response is as expected, then that person is declared to be enlightened!\nSo apparently it’s quite “simple” - all one has to do is to memorise these core teachings and recite them in accordance to a formula!\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple. In addition to knowing all the core teachings, the person has to truthfully declare they are practising them perfectly and hence have achieved true liberation.\nI find the list interesting because it includes the four noble truths but not dependent origination, and it seems to require renouncing and becoming ordained as a mandatory prerequisite. Given that this sutta is meant for monks confirming each other’s enlightenment, this is not surprising. Presumably laypeople have no need to declare themselves - they can just reach enlightenment and ride off into the sunset.\nThe loss of Nibbāna So how do we explain why there are no known arahants today, and apparently there hasn’t been any potentially for thousands of years? Perhaps it’s because in the years after the Buddha’s death, his teachings became corrupted and less well understood. The concept of enlightenment evolved from a relatively straightforward and achievable state to a mystical, unknowable state that no one will recognise nibbana even if they have attained it, or the concept evolved into something entirely different and hence unattainable.\nA possible explanation is that in the years following the Buddha’s death, it became harder and harder to attract people to the religion without the charismatic personality of the founder. Buddhism was in competition with other religious beliefs of the day, including Jainism and Brahmanism.\nThe concept of nibbāna as being something prosaic and relatively attainable, that requires renunciation from the world and yet promises seemingly very little in return (apart, of course, from everlasting relief from suffering) would make Buddhism less attractive compared to other religions that promises union with the Godhead, or supernatural powers.\nSo the disciples of the Buddha decided to engage in some “marketing”. The Buddha was no longer an ordinary human being, he was omniscient and has supernatural powers, including the ability to delve into past lives (and according to some future lives as well), read the minds of other people, levitate, and ascend into the heavens to converse with deities.\nNibbāna became an esoteric state that was not attainable without years of study, secret knowledge and altered states of consciousness.\nThe monks that made these embellishments did so with the best intentions. The idea was to have enough “pizzaz” added to the suttas to make Buddhism attractive to ordinary people in comparison with other religions. But those in know would be able to distinguish between the true teachings and these embellishments.\nUnfortunately, centuries past by and new generations of monks no longer had the inside knowledge about what was true and what was added. So they started believing that everything was true. When that happened, arahants became fewer and fewer and eventually extinct.\nThe response it seems was to make everything even more complex. Clearly, the teachings were not enough, and additional material was developed, ostensibly because the teachings have become too obscure and explanations and commentaries were needed. These commentaries drew from other religions, including meditation techniques and practices. And thus Buddha’s teachings became overcomplicated, corrupt, and no longer easy to understand or digest.\nOn top of everything, the practice of Buddhist meditation gradually disappeared and was lost, so monks no longer even knew how to meditate. Today’s Buddhist meditation practice is a relatively modern invention, and can be traced to a handful of monks who developed these techniques from studying the commentaries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Did they “rediscover” meditation, or a completely new set of techniques? We may never know.\nBuddhism devolved in a religion where the some of its practitioners no longer believe it is possible to attain enlightenment in the current lifetime, and therefore the best possible alternative is to meditate, gain merit and hopefully get reborn in a heaven where they can await the appearance of the next Buddha.\n","categories":"","description":"My current views on this complex and not well understood goal of Buddhism\n","excerpt":"My current views on this complex and not well understood goal of …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/overview/enlightenment/","tags":"","title":"Enlightenment"},{"body":"ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo (noble eightfold path) # ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo ## sammādiṭṭhi - right belief ## sammāsaṅkappo - right intention ## sammāvācā - right speech ## sammākammanto - right conduct ## sammāājīvo - right livelihood ## sammāvāyāmo - right effort ## sammāsati - right mindfulness ## sammāsamādhi - right concentration mindmap ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo sammādiṭṭhi dukkhe ñāṇaṁ dukkhasamudaye ñāṇaṁ dukkhanirodhe ñāṇaṁ dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya ñāṇaṁ sammāsaṅkappo nekkhammasaṅkappo abyāpādasaṅkappo avihiṁsāsaṅkappo sammāvācā musāvādā veramaṇī pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī pharusāya vācāya veramaṇī samphappalāpā veramaṇī sammākammanto pāṇātipātā veramaṇī adinnādānā veramaṇī abrahmacariyā veramaṇī sammāājīvo micchāājīvaṁ pahāya sammāājīvena jīvitaṁ kappeti sammāvāyāmo anuppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ anuppādāya uppannānaṁ pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya anuppannānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ uppādāya uppannānaṁ kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ ṭhitiyā asammosāya bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya bhāvanāya pāripūriyā sammāsati kāye kāyānupassī vedanāsu vedanānupassī citte cittānupassī dhammesu dhammānupassī sammāsamādhi paṭhamaṁ jhānaṁ dutiyaṁ jhānaṁ tatiyaṁ jhānaṁ catutthaṁ jhānaṁ Reference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P Vibhaṅgasutta SN 45.8 PTS 5.9–5.10 ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering\n","excerpt":"noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/4truths/8path/","tags":["4ariyasaccāni","dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā","ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo"],"title":"dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṁ"},{"body":"1.

Instead, your knowledge and understanding is known by yourself, seen by yourself, experienced by yourself, and the teaching of the Buddha is verifiable and should be personally experienced by those who are able to do so.\nThe Buddha’s teaching can be encapsulated as Four “Pure” Truths:\nThe pure truth of “dukkha” (suffering) The pure truth of the source of dukkha The pure truth of the end of dukkha The pure truth of the path of progress, leading to the end of dukkha Dukkha Dukkha is an underlying dissatisfaction caused by:\nbirth (and rebirth) old age death grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble association with the disliked separation from the loved not getting what one desires In summary, the dukkha is analogous to a continuously burning fire fed by the Five Masses of Fuel (“pañcupādānakkhandhā”).\nThe Five Masses of Fuel These are five processes:\nrūpa (form), vedanā (feelings), saññā (perceptions), saṅkhāra (volitional results), viññāṇa (consciousness), These processes result in:\nsuffering, disease, body disfigurements, injury, trouble and misfortune, oppression, inflictions by others, disintegration, emptiness. Impermanence Life, and everything that is experienced, is impermanent. Time passes, beings die (and are reborn), like water flowing in a stream, ever changing and moving. The impermanence of life is dukkha.\nNo permanent “self” or “soul” What we regard as a sense of “self” is also impermanent. Our conception of a “being” is nothing more than the collection of the Five Masses of Fuel, there is no “sum” that is greater than the “parts.”\nThere is suffering, but no “self” is suffering\nThere is action, but no “self” is performing\nThere is entinguishment, but no “self” is extinguishing\nThere is a path, but no “self” is travelling.\nThe source of dukkha. Dukkha is caused by craving, leading to rebirth, accompanied by delight and desire, and experienced by one who takes delight here and there; thoroughly enjoying this and that:\ncraving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence, craving for annihilation. The end of dukkha Dukkha is ended by completely fading away and ending craving, and:\ngiving up relinquishing liberation, non-attachment The path of progress leading to the end of dukkha Also known as the Pure Path in Eight Parts (“ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo”), consisting of:\nsammādiṭṭhi (right view), sammāsaṅkappa (right intention), sammāvāca (right speech), sammākammanta (right conduct), sammāājīva (right livelihood), sammāvāyāma (right effort), sammāsati (right awareness), sammāsamādhi (right mental composure). The basis of the Pure Path is the mind pulling away from the Five Masses of Fuel, which causes the fuel to be spent and the fire to stop burning. Let us examine some of these masses in greater detail.\nvedanā (Feelings) There are three types of feelings, either relating to the body or to the mind:\npleasant feelings, with an underlying tendency towards desire unpleasant feelings, with an underlying tendency towards aversion neutral feelings, with an underlying tendency towards ignorance These underlying tendencies - desire, aversion, ignorance - should be given up.\nsañña (Perceptions) There are six types of perceptions:\nperception of form, perception of sound, perception of smells, perception of taste, perception of touch, perception of mental characteristics. Sañña is the process of recognising “recognition.” And what is “recognition”? It is the ability to classify representations, for example colour (“blue”, “yellow”, “red”, “white”, etc.)\nsaṅkhārā (Volitional Thought Processes) There are three types of volitional thought processes:\nbodily thought process (intention which result in bodily action),\neg. breathing in and out verbal thought process (intention which result in verbal action),\neg. inner dialogue mental thought process (intention which result in thought formation).\neg. sañña (perceptions) and vedanā (feelings) There are six classes of volitional thoughts (intentions):\nthoughts about forms, thoughts about sounds, thoughts about smells, thoughts about tastes, thoughts about contacts, thoughts about mental characteristics. viññāṇa (Consciousness) The following prerequisites or dependencies cause consciousness to arise, and be categorised:\neye (faculty of seeing)\ndependency of forms\ncategorised as “visual-consciousness” ear (faculty of hearing)\ndependency of sounds\ncategorised as “auditory-consciousness” nose (faculty of smelling)\ndependency of smells\ncategorised as “olfactory-consciousness” tongue (faculty of tasting)\ndependency of taste\ncategorised as “gustatory-consciousness” body (faculty of touch)\ndependency of physical sensations\ncategorised as “tactile-consciousness” mind (faculty of tought)\ndependency of mental states\ncategorised as “mental-consciousness” bhava (Existence) It is a fruit ripening in the realm of sensual desire. If there is no volitional action, there would not be desire for existence.\nAction is the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving is the moisture.\nWhile beings are impeded by ignorance, bound by craving, fallen away from their roots, consciousness is well established and in the future produces renewed existence.\nConsciousness May Be Calmed Whenever any suffering arises,\nAll caused by consciousness;\nWith the cessation of consciousness,\nThere is no birth of suffering.\nHaving known this danger,\nsuffering is caused by consciousness;\nThe bhikkhu stills the consciousness,\nAnd so attained final Nibbāna satisfied.\nThe Psychological Law Of Causality And Its Use Having a cause is a condition for saññā (perceptions) arising and ceasing for a person.\nPractice arising a single perception, and ceasing a single perception.\nLiberation Is A Natural Process For the moral and accomplished in virtue, nothing ought to be done with intention.\n“May no regrets arise of me.”\nThis characteristic, non-regret, arises for whoever is moral and accomplished in virtue.\nOne who has no regrets, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May joy arise of me.”\nThis characteristic, joy, is born for whoever has no regrets.\nOne who is joyous, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May delight arise of me.”\nThis characteristic, delight, arises for whoever is joyous.\nOne who is delighted, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May my body calm down.”\nThis characteristic, body, calms down for whoever is delighted.\nOne of calm body, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May I experience happiness.”\nThis characteristic, happiness, is experienced for whoever has a calm body.\nOne is happy, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May my mind become composed.”\nThis characteristic, mind, becomes composed for whoever is happy.\nOne is composed, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May I see and know reality as it is.”\nThis characteristic, reality as it is, is seen and known for whoever is composed.\nOne who sees and know reality as it is, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May I be dispassionate and detached.”\nThis characteristic, one becomes dispassionate and detached for whoever seeing and knowing reality as it is.\nOne who becomes dispassionate and detached, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.\n“May I personally realise understanding and insight into liberation.”\nThis characteristic, one personally realises understanding and insight into liberation for whoever is dispassionate and detached.\nThe Origin And Control Of Suffering Visual consciousness (cakkhuviññāṇa) arises dependent on rūpa (form) and the faculty of seeing. The three combined together is phassa (contact).\nDependent on phassa (contact), vedanā (feelings).\nDependent on vedanā (feelings), taṇhā (craving).\nWhile completely fading away and ending of craving, cessation of grasping.\nFrom cessation of grasping, cessation of being.\nFrom cessation of being, cessation of birth.\nFrom cessation of birth, old age, grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble cease.\nThus of this whole lot, there is cessation of mass of suffering.\nThis is disappearance of dukkha (suffering).\nEverything Is Caused Like a certain seed,\nSown in field, grows;\nMeeting with soil nutrients,\nand moisture, both of these.\nThus, the masses and elements,\nAnd these six senses;\nReason for arise of dependence,\nDisintegration of dependence, ceases\nMan Forms His Own Destiny Irrigators guide water,\nArrow makers straighten arrow;\nCarpenters straighten wood,\nThe wise tames the self.\nKarma Sometimes Works Slowly By no means completed wrong action,\nThickens quickly like milk;\nSmouldering, heedlessly follows,\nLike fire covered with ashes.\nHow Rebirth Is Influenced By Actions Here, a certain person generates harmful intentions resulting in bodily, verbal and mental actions.\nHaving generated harmful intentions resulting in bodily, verbal and mental actions, he is reborn in a harmful world.\nThat being, who is reborn in a harmful world, is afflicted with harmful contact.\nThat being, who is afflicted with harmful contact, experiences totally painful harmful feelings just like beings living in hell.\nA Strong Wish May Influence Rebirth Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom.\nIt occurred to him:\n“Oh dear, oh no, death (of my) body, following death, I should be reborn in company of wealthy men of the ruling caste.”\nHe takes his mind, focuses and cultivates it.\nRegarding that, those volitional thought processes and state of mind, thus cultivated and practised often, leads to rebirth.\nThis way, this path of progress leads to rebirth.\nA Summary Of The Way Non-doing of all wrongdoing,\nTaking up of wholesome;\nPurifying one’s own mind,\nThis is the teaching of the Buddha.\nRenunciation Formerly, I was similar to an ignorant being, living as a layman.\nBecause of that, the Tathāgata and his disciples taught the Dhamma to me.\nHaving heard that Dhamma, I acquired faith in the Tathāgata.\nI reflected like that, endowed with the the gaining of that faith.\nHousehold life is crowded and dirty, renunciation is open space.\nIt is not easy from being settled in domestic living to living a completely perfect and flawless spiritual path.\nWhat if I were to renounce from household life to homeless state, having shaved off hair and heard, and having put on ochre robe.\nIndeed, friend, after some time, having left behind a small or large pile of wealth, and a small or large family circle, I renounced from household life to homeless state, having shaved off hair and heard, and having put on ochre robe.\nsammādiṭṭhi (Right View) Understanding of:\ndukkha, source of dukkha, end of dukkha, the path of progress leading to the end of dukkha. sammāsaṅkappa (Right Intention), Intention of:\nrenunciation, good, not harming. sammāvāca (Right Speech) Abstinence from:\nfalse speech, slanderous speech, harsh speech, gossip. Giving up false speech, abstaining from false speech, being truthful, true to one’s word, honest, reliable, keeping promises for everyone in the world.\nGiving up slanderous speech, abstaining from slanderous speech. Having listened here, does not tell in such-and-such place for the purposes of disturbance, or having listened in such and such place, does not tell here for the purposes of disturbance. Conciliator of the broken, provider of friendly terms, enjoying concord, liking harmony, delighting in unity, talking peace-making speech.\nGiving up harsh speech, abstaining from harsh speech. Whatever that speech is, it is gentle, pleasant to hear, friendly, heart-warming, polite, loved by the people, charming to the masses, talking appropriate speech.\nGiving up gossip, abstaining from gossip, speaking at the proper time, speaking what is true, speaking what is meaningful, speaking about the Dhamma, speaking about the discipline, talking speech worth remembering, timely, reasonable, purposeful, beneficial.\nsammākammanta (Right Conduct) Abstinence from:\nkilling living beings, theft, sexual misconduct. Life long arahants (awakened beings):\ngive up incelibacy, practice celibacy, keep far away from sexual intercourse, abstain from vulgar practice. give up and abstains from wine, spirits, drugs and states of intoxication. eat one meal a day, abstain from eating at night, and between midday and dawn. abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, watching shows, using garlands, perfumes, oils, adornments and decorations. give up and abstain from large and luxurious beds, prepare low or small beds, or spread of grass. sammāājīva (Right Livelihood), give up wrong livelihood, prepares for a way of life with right livelihood. Wrong livelihood:\nCheating, cajoling, indirect begging, putting others down, desiring acquisition with profit. sammāvāyāma (Right Effort) For the non-arising of evil and unwholesome characteristics, he generates a desire for non-arising, tries to make an effort, start, strives on the mind, and exerts himself. He generates a desire for the giving up of the arising of evil and unwholesome characteristics, tries to make an effort, start, strives on the mind, and exerts himself. For the non-arising of wholesome characteristics, he generates a desire for arising, tries to make an effort, start, strives on the mind, and exerts himself. He generates a desire for the persistence of, non-confusion of, increase of, maturity of, developing of, fulfillment of the arising of wholesome characteristics, tries to make an effort, start, strives on the mind, and exerts himself. sammāsati (Right Awareness) The bhikkhu:\nwhen walking knows clearly “I am walking”, when standing knows clearly “I am standing”, when sitting knows clearly “I am seating”, when lying down knows clearly “I am lying down.” In whatever way his body is orientated, in that way he knows clearly.\nHe is aware of:\nobserving the body internally, externally, internally and externally (together), contemplating the nature of arising, disappearance, arising and disappearing (together) of physical processes. And for him he keeps in mind and establishes “there is a body”, and he is independent and mindful through understanding and continuous awareness, and he does not cling to anything in the world.\nThe bhikkhu is attentive to:\ngoing forward, coming back, looking ahead, looking around, flexing, stretching, carrying the outer robe, bowl and robe, eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, going to the toilet, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, being awake, talking, keeping quiet. Irradiation Of Friendliness, Compassion, Tenderness, And Equanimity The bhikkhu is intent and mindful of filling all compass directions, above and below, horizontally, everywhere, to all beings in the universe, with expansive, grand, infinite, peaceful, without ill will:\nmettā (goodwill/friendliness) karuṇā (compassion/pity) muditā (emphatic happiness) upekkhā (balance/equanimity) sammāsamādhi (Right Mental Composure) Nine levels of mental composure:\nSecluding oneself from sensual pleasures, detaching from unskillful behaviour, one enters and remains in the first jhāna, accompanied by reflection and consideration, secluded from defilements, with felicity and satisfaction. Of that, whatever past perceptions of sensual pleasure cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion. With the conclusion of reflection and consideration, one enters and remains in the second jhāna, accompanied by an inner calming of intention, focused and free of thought or inner dialogue, born from stable mind, with felicity and satisfaction. Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure. With the detachment from felicity, enters and remains in the third jhāna, one remains mentally balanced, is fully aware and being present, experiences body comfort, as the pure ones describe: “equanimous, attentive, living at ease.” Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of equanimity, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of equanimity. Just before the giving up of the pleasant and the unpleasant and the disappearance of mental pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, one enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, in a neutral state, and possessing purification of awareness by equanimity. Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of equanimity cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation. Going beyond perception of form altogether, with the disappearance of perception of sense impressions, ignoring the recognition of multiple/diverse things, one enters and remains in the base of the infinity of space, ie. “infinite space”. Going beyond the base of infinite space altogether, one enters and remains in the base of the infinite consciousness, ie. “infinite consciousness”. Going beyond the base of infinite consciousness altogether, one enters and remains in the base of nothingness, ie. “there is nothing”. Having seen the inadequacy of the base of neither perception nor non-perception that is practiced often, one applies oneself to expecting and attaining the ending of recognition and feeling. Going beyond the base of neither perception nor non-perception altogether, one enters and remains in the ending of recognition and feeling, having seen by that knowledge, one arrives at the exhaustion of the effluents. And from whatever indeed, I entered and emerged from these nine attainments of the successive stages in mental composure forwards and backwards, then I claimed to the deities in the world, Māra, Brahmas, religious practitioners, general population, kings and commoners: “This is the highest, perfect awakening, and perfect enligtenment!”\nHaving insight, the realisation arose for me: “Unshakeable is my mental liberation, this is the final birth, now there is no rebirth.”\nThe State Of Emptiness (After that, Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion in the late afternoon and approached the Bhagavant. Having approached, he bowed to the Bhagavant and sat down to one side.) The Bhagavant said this to Venerable Sāriputta sitting on one side:\n“You are tranquil indeed, Sāriputta, and your appearance is pure and complexion bright. How have you been spending time lately, Sāriputta?”\n“Lately, I often dwell on emptiness, Bhante.”\n“Excellent, Sāriputta. Truly, Sāriputta, lately you often dwell in the internal dwelling of an illustrious being. Sāriputta, this is the internal dwelling of an illustrious being: Emptiness.”\nHow To Meet Persecution And Death Friend, if others behave with unpleasantness, disagreeableness, dislikeableness to that bhikkhu - even hitting him with hands, stones, sticks, weapons. Thus he knows: This body is of such nature that it is possible to physically hit it with hands, stones, sticks, weapons.\nBut this is indeed said by the Bhagavant in the exhortation with the simile of the saw: “Bhikkhave, even if lowlife robbers cut off all the limbs with a doubled handled saw, even in that case whoever will corrupt his mind is not practising the teaching of mine. And now applied with me there will be active determination, presence and awareness, unmuddled, tranquility, unagitated body, composed and focused mind. And now certainly, even when hit by hands, stones, sticks, weapons in the body, surely in this case the teaching of the Buddha is practised.”\nA Bhikkhuni’s Story Consumed by defilements,\nPursuing beautiful perceptions;\nDid not obtain balance of mind,\nSlave of the impassioned heart.\nThin, pale, sickly,\nSeven years I wandered;\nBy day or night I did not,\nExperience comfort, suffering miserably.\nFrom that, having taken a rope,\nEntered into the inner forest;\nMy wish is now suicide,\nBut whatever deficiences will repeat again.\nHaving made a strong noose,\nHaving tied to a branch of a tree;\nPlaced noose on neck,\nThen my mind was liberated.\nThe Buddha Relates How He Attained Nibbāna From my own doing, I was liable to:\nbirth old age sickness death sorrow defilement Searching for the unsurpassed sanctuary of extinguishment from (birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, defilement), I achieved the unsurpassed sanctuary of (non birth, non-aging, health, non-death, non-sorrow, undefiled).\nHaving insight, the realisation arose for me: “Unshakeable is the my mental liberation, this is the final birth, now there is no rebirth.”\nNibbāna All passions abandoned by me,\nAll ill will from the masses (of fuel);\nAll my delusions gone,\nI am liberated and quenched.\nNibbāna is satisfying Certainly Nibbāna is very satisfying,\nTaught by the perfectly awakened one;\nFree from sorrow, a pure sanctuary,\nWhenever dukkha ceases.\nNibbāna is within reach In possibility of non-aging,\nWhat good in whatever from aging sensual pleasures for you?\nSeized by death and illness,\nAll classes of beings wherever.\nThis is not aging, not subject to death,\nThis is free from old age and death, and sorrow;\nPeaceful and unobstructed,\nFree from stumbling and fear.\nThis is achieved by many,\nObtainable now this freedom from death;\nWhoever applies properly,\nNot able without striving.\nNibbāna is a way out There exists, that which is not born, not become, not made, not formed.\nFrom that, a way out of being born, becoming, made, formed can be clearly known.\nNibbāna and death Like a flame blown by a gust of wind,\nThe essence runs away and approaches eluding definition;\nThus a sage freed from representation and body,\nThe essence runs away and approaches eluding definition.\nThere is no quantification of the disappeared,\nBy whatever that is said, that is not for him;\nIn eradicating every characteristic,\nAll eradicated from even representation.\n","categories":"","description":"My independent translation of the excerpts from the Tipiṭaka in **Pali Buddhist Texts** Explained to the Beginner, Rune E A Johansson, Curzon Press, Copenhagen, Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies Monograph Series, Third Edition, 1981.\n","excerpt":"My independent translation of the excerpts from the Tipiṭaka in **Pali …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/pali/pbt/","tags":"","title":"My Translations from \"Pali Buddhist Texts\""},{"body":" Part of “A Beginner (Non-Linguist) Guide to Learning Pali” I am a relative beginner in learning Pali. I started learning the language in earnest on 30 June 2023. This is my conceited attempt at thinking I can author my own Pali textbook, based on what I have learnt so far.\nMotivation Why write my own book when there are so many excellent textbooks already on Pali?\nThe first, and best answer, is that I don’t learn until I am able to explain it to someone else, even if that someone else is an imaginary reader. There is nothing more conducive to solidifying knowledge than to have to distill it and explain it in language a “golden retriever can understand” (to paraphrase a line from the film Margin Call).\nSecondly, I find other Pali textbooks, particularly the ones written by English (or European) linguists confusing and somewhat frustrating. They use highly technical linguistic terms, which I don’t understand well. Their grammatical explanations can often be over complicated and obtuse. I am not saying every book is like this, there are many examples of books that appear to be clearly written. Perhaps the one who is obtuse is me.\nI find I learn a language best “natively”, ie. by its own terms and gradually “bootstrapping” myself until I achieve a minimum viable level of competency to start reading text. As children, this is how we learn a language, by osmosis from hearing others, until we are confident enough to form our own words. We then improve by reading, which broadens our knowledge and proficiency further.\nThere are no native speakers of Pali, but fortunately there are books describing the Pali language written by ancient Pali speakers. The earliest, and probably most well known is the Kaccāyana Pali Vyākaraṇam. This was probably written in the 5th-6th century CE in India, and the author has been ascribed to the Arahat Mahākaccāyana (but this is disputed).\nThere are, of course, other Classical Pali grammars, including those written by Moggalāna (circa 11-12 AD), and Saddanīti by Aggavaṃsa (circa 1157 AD). Rūpasiddhi (circa 13 AD) updated and reorganised the content of Kaccayana. However, to avoid confusion from multiple sources, I have decided to primarily derive my textbook from Kaccāyana. Also, there is an excellent translation of Kaccāyana into English (which I am heavily reliant on) by A. Thitzana which can be downloaded for free from Kaccāyana Pāli Grammar Volumes 1 - 2.\nIn authoring this textbook, I have decided to avoid using linguistic technical terms as much as possible (such as conjugation, declension, nominative, etc.) but use “ordinary” English words to describe elements of the Pali language. I will use Pali terminology to describe aspects of the Pali language as much as I can, and only resort to English to describe what they mean.\nSo you will find my textbook do not use the same terms as you will find in other Pali textbooks and grammar books. I apologise in advance if this leads to confusion and frustration. I will attempt to point out the equivalent terms used in other textbooks whenever possible, to help readers in drawing comparisons if they wish.\nAgain, I do so because I feel strongly that it is best to learn Pali on it’s own terms, and not impose an external linguistic framework on it. Such frameworks may be useful to linguists, but they tend to confuse beginners like me.\nGoal and Structure The aim of this textbook is to get the reader to a level where they can tackle the texts in the Tipiṭaka (the Three Baskets of the Buddhist canon) as quickly as possible. Less emphasis is placed on the ability to listen, speak or write.\nMost Pali textbooks gently introduce the various features of the language over a number of chapters, so significant progress needs to be made before a reader is able to understand moderately complex sentences, let alone entire suttas from the Tipiṭaka. For example, A.K. Warder’s “Introduction to Pali” covers the basics of Pali grammar over 16 lessons. Assuming a reader will cover 1-2 lessons per week, this means a reader is not ready to read the Tipiṭaka until 2-4 months later.\nBy contrast, this textbook gives an overview of all the essential features of the Pali language in the first chapter, so the reader in theory should have the key knowledge to read the Tipiṭaka in days, or weeks, rather than months, or years.\nI am speaking from experience. I started studying Pali in late June, and by mid July I was already starting to read my first sutta.\nHow is this achieved? All the complex production rules with regards to sandhi and word endings are moved to appendices. The goal is to enable the reader to be able to read Pali, not necessarily to be able to write or speak it. So the reader can study the production rules based on their own needs and priority rather than being forced to apply them from the beginning.\nAlso, unlike other textbooks, this textbook does not focus on teaching vocabulary, nor does it require the reader to memorise long lists of words. Vocabulary is introduced only when necessary, and just before it is required. The reader is encouraged to develop their own vocabulary based on the material they choose to read, and therefore they only need to learn the words that are important to them.\nAfter the initial overview of the Pali language, the textbook alternates from diving deeper into aspects of the Pali language, to exercises involving reading, understanding and translating extracts from the Tipiṭaka. The reader is encouraged not to necessarily follow the textbook linearly but tackle chapters in their own order of preference, or to embark on their own reading journey and read whatever parts of the Tipiṭaka they wish to, using the textbook merely as a reference and light guidance.\nPrerequisites This textbook does not require prior familiarity with either the Pali language or the Buddhist Pali canon. It does, however, require the reader to have a strong interest in both and willing to focus their efforts in learning.\nKnowledge of multiple languages (including computer languages) and prior experience in learning a foreign language can be advantageous, but not required.\nThis textbook takes advantage of modern technology. It is not written in paper but available as hyperlinked pages on a website. It also assumes the reader has access to and is familiar with modern tools such as the Digital Pali Dictionary or the online version of The Pali Text Society’s Pali-English Dictionary so the reader can easily look up any words they are encountering for the first time.\nIn particular, the Digital Pali Dictionary can look up words in inflected form and has advanced features like sandhi splitting and compound word deconstruction, which further reduces the need to learn how to do those.\nFinally, the textbook also assumes the reader is familiar with electronic editions of the Tipiṭaka, including:\nSuttaCentral SuttaCentral contains early Buddhist texts, known as the Tipiṭaka or “Three Baskets”. This is a large collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha or his earliest disciples, who were teaching in India around 2500 years ago. They are regarded as sacred canon in all schools of Buddhism.

Note Every writer’s style is influenced by their background and personal interests. My interests in music and photography have influenced my approach to structuring this textbook. In particular, I think of constructing Pali word endings as similar to music composition, applying the rules of harmony and I refer to the noun genders as “major” and “minor”. I also have a tendency to shift viewpoints and zoom in and out of specific topics much like a photographer would. I do apologise if you are not used to my way of thinking.\nFamiliarity with software development and even a cursory knowledge of computer languages will also be advantageous. I believe computer literacy should be regarded as a fundamental aspect of basic literacy, and the ability to “program” or “code” is as important as reading, writing, and ‘rithmetic.\nHaving said that, even prior exposure to writing web pages or the most basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is probably enough of an advantage. I use a notation similar to functional programming to label word endings, and sometimes illustrate a sentence’s meaning using pseudo UML diagrams. Even if the reader has no prior experience of either, hopefully the notation should be self-evident.\nSo, without further ado, let’s begin!\nNext Chapter 1: The Pali Language Basics ","categories":["palibook"],"description":"Motivation for writing this book, the goal and structure of the book, and prerequisites for the reader\n","excerpt":"Motivation for writing this book, the goal and structure of the book, …","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/intro/","tags":"","title":"0: Introduction"},{"body":"The basic teaching of the four noble truths (dukkham samudayo nirodho magga) can be expressed as a medical diagnosis (The Dawn of Abhidharma p. 113):\ndisease: duḥkha pathogen: craving health: nirvāṇa cure: eightfold path cattāri ariyasaccāni # cattāri ariyasaccāni ## dukkham - pain - incapable of suffering ## dukkha-samudayo - origin - arising ## dukkha-nirodha - cease - suppress ## dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada - leading to - path, way This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence. netaṁ mama, nesohamasmi, na meso attāti— evametaṁ yathābhūtaṁ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṁ.\nReference Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta DN 22 PTS 2.290–2.315 PT Saccavibhaṅgasutta MN 141 PTS 3.248–3.252 Mahākhandhaka Pli Tv Kd 1 PTS 1.1–1.100 P ","categories":["Sutta"],"description":"The Four Noble Truths.\n","excerpt":"The Four Noble Truths.\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/sutta/4truths/","tags":["4ariyasaccāni"],"title":"cattāri ariyasaccāni"},{"body":" Resources for Learning Pali The classical, literary language of Theravada Buddhism, with special reference to problems of indigenous orthography and phonology by Eisel Mazard (大影) LEARN PALI LANGUAGE Pali language grammar tutorials.

It thus aims to enable you to read the Buddha’s discourses in the original as quickly as possible. The textbook for the course is A New Course in Reading Pali: Entering the Word of the Buddha by James Gair and W.S. Karunatilleke (1998, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, India. ISBN 81-208-1440-1). The Pali grammatical tables were designed by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita. OCBS Courses Online Courses from the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies Pali-English Dictionary Online version of The Pali Text Society’s Pali-English dictionary Wisdom and Wonders Introduction to Pali This course, Introduction to Pali by Ajahn Brahmali, is separated into 24 parts. There are approximately 20 hours of material, including lessons and exercises. The course is intended for those who wish to read content from the Pali canon, rather than those who wish to read, write and construct terms in Pali. The course uses Introduction to Pali by A. K. Warder as the core text, and covers the first 16 chapters. Open Buddhist University: The Pāli Language: Level 1 This course doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of linguistics or classical languages, and so serves as a suitable introduction for anyone. Note that the examples will not be drawn directly from the Pāli Canon. Grammar and Prosody This section contains studies of the grammar and prosody of Buddhist texts, with original texts in Pāli and Sanskrit (together with extensive annotation). Illustrated Glossary of Pāli Terms This Glossary was originally conceived of as a way of supporting my own translations. Preparing it first of all involved gathering all instances of words in question together with their contexts. It would then usually become clear that words carried different meanings in different contexts. This was in accordance with the findings in Pāli dictionaries, which rarely consist of an explanation by a single word. The excerpts I found could then be divided into groups accordingly. Finding the correct English term for Pāli words when they are grouped on the same page turned out to be altogether easier than working with single passages or sentences and experimenting with terms in one’s head. By following this method, and sorting and resorting groups of quotes over days, months, or even years, continuously applying the find-and-replace tool, shifting backwards and forwards nearly two million words, it eventually confirmed or denied choices of my original renderings, and led to increasing confidence in my findings. Such a system of translation is only possible with computer leverage. With computers, Pāli studies have entered a new era.

Altogether there are 675 suttas, which shows how compact Kaccāyana is. Pali, like most other Indo-Aryan languages, is an oral language spoken as vākya (sentences) made up of vacana (words) which are a combination of akkhara (“sounds”, or “letters from an “alphabet”). {1}\nThere are debates about the origin of Pali, whether it was in fact a real language actually spoken by people, as opposed to an “invented” language specifically for the purposes of recording Buddhist doctrine. The term “Pali” actually just means “text”, and today “Pali” is used primarily for Buddhist literature.\nPali Alphabet and pronunciation {2}-{9} The Buddha may have spoken a language similar to Pali, and when he died his sayings were collected and systematised so they can be transmitted orally generation to generation using memorisation techniques such as chanting. The Pali canon was not written down until hundreds of years after the Buddha has passed away.\nAs such, there is no “official” Pali alphabet or writing. Pali can be transcribed fairly faithfully in a number of alphabets, including Roman letters (with the addition of a few diacritical marks or accented characters similar to other European languages).\nFor this textbook, I will use Roman letters as the basis for the Pali alphabet since I am used to that.\nOf course, no one knows for sure how Pali words would have been pronounced, and how Pali sentences would have been spoken, particularly with regards to tonality. Modern day Pali pronunciation is based on how the Buddhist Pali canon is chanted in various countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.\nReference B: The Pāli Alphabet Pali sentence structure A Pali sentence (vākya) or Pali text (pali) is generally composed of multiple words (pada or vacana). Since Pali was an oral language, punctuation mark and upper/lower case conventions are typically not used, although modern editors have sometimes added these to aid reading.\nWords also do not need to be separated by spaces, although modern Pali editions of text do add spaces, to aid reading. Later on, we will find out Pali has compound words, which consist of multiple words joined together to create a composite word.\nTo be able to distinguish words in a sentence, Pali relies heavily on paccaya (affixes to roots or word stems) to create distinctive word endings. Fluent Pali listeners will no doubt listen to the sound of these endings to distinguish the words. These endings also give additional meaning to the words and indicate how the words are used in a sentence.\nBecause of this, the word order in a Pali sentence is less important than many other languages, however there are conventions for how to arrange words in a typical sentence. Speakers can unconventionally reorder words, typically to give emphasis to certain words or to augment or add nuance to a sentence’s emotional meaning.\nThis is similar to our reaction when we hear “Yoda” speak in the “Star Wars” series of films. We appreciate who Yoda is as a personality, and we pay more attention to his words simply because of the different order.\ndhātu (roots) Fundamentally, all words in Pali are said to be derived from one or more dhātu (roots). These roots are similar to Sanskrit roots. Pali can be regarded as a simplified version of Sanskrit, however some of the roots may have different meanings, or nuances. There are some that say Sanskrit was a “sacred” language reserved for priests and members of the holy caste, whereas Pali, along with many other Indian languages, was spoken by the common people. The Buddha may have spoken in Pali because he wanted to convey his teachings to ordinary people, not just privileged members of a particular caste.\ndhātu can have 1-3 syllables:\ntype example meaning single stem or one-syllable roots vā to move yā to go pā to drink ji to conquer nī to carry su to flow bhū to be dual-word roots gamu to go paca to cook vada to speak multiple-stem or three syllable roots vāyama to attempt araha to deserve kilisa to torment A series of transformations convert a root into a word by adding paccaya (affixes). Words can also be formed by combining a root with one or more upasagga (prefixes). Multiple upasagga and different forms of paccaya can be applied to a root before it becomes a word, thus creating multi-syllabic words. The result is a word that can be used in a sentence.\nAltogether there are around 1700 roots in Pali. However, many many words can be made from them by attaching upasagga (prefixes) and various affixes (paccaya). In theory, fresh words can be formed by new combinations of roots with different prefixes so the adventurous Pali student can attempt to create Pali words for “modern” terms such as “computer” or “phone”.\nIt is not really necessary to memorise the 1700 roots, although it will be very useful if the reader chooses to do so. Knowing all the roots and the various prefixes and affixes will allow the reader to sometimes (not always) “guess” the meaning of a word not previously encountered, and will also help when applying the various transformation rules (see below).\nsandhi (word transformations) As Pali is a spoken language, when words are combined to form a sentence, changes may occur between words (or sometimes even within a word) to make the sentence “flow” or “sound” better.\nIn English, we often shorten words like “can not” to “can’t”, or “I will” to “I’ll”. This happens very frequently in Pali, especially when two vowels become adjacent to each other from two words next to each other, and there are complex rules governing how such transformations occur.\nAs a example {10} (don’t worry about the meaning of the words for now):\ntatra + ayaṁ + ādi\n= tatra + aā yaṁm + ādi\n= tatrā’ya’mādi\n= tatrāyamādi\nAs you can see, when there are two adjacent vowels when we join two or more words together, sandhi typically involves deleting one of the vowels, and then either retaining, lengthening or changing the remaining vowel. Sometimes the consonant next to the vowel may also be changed.\nThe overall effect is to make the words easier to say as a group. Although tatrāyamādi may seem like a single word because of sandhi, a listener should still regard them as separate words when trying to understand a sentence. However, some sandhi combinations of common words are so often encountered they have acquired distinctive meaning as combined words.\nAnother example {11}\ntatra + abhiratiṁ + iccheyya\n= tatra + aā bhiratiṁm + iccheyya\n= tatrā’bhirati’miccheyya\n= tatrābhiratimiccheyya\n“… should prefer enjoying at that …”\nFor the time being, we are not going to go into detail on these rules but be aware that words may change in a sentence. Eventually, as you read more and more sentences in Pali, these changes will become easier to recognise.\nReference For a summary of the rules, please refer to E: sandhi Rules {12}-{51} nāmā (nouns) {52} nāmā are the most common type of words in Pali, and roughly (but not exactly) correspond to the term “noun” in English. nāmā also means “name”, so these words represent things that we can “name” - including people, places, things, numbers, feelings and many other objects or concepts.\nExample {53} Here is a simple sentence, consisting of 3 nāma:\neso no satthā\nwhich translates as:\nthat person/being / our / teacher\nThat person [is] our teacher.\nInstead of satthā other examples may be:\nbrahmā (God) attā (self) sakhā (friend) rājā (King) liṅga (gender) {53} nāma can be classified into 3 different types or liṅga. The word liṅga actually means “gender”, and traditionally each nāma is assigned a gender. The liṅga represents an “intrinsic property” of the nāma.\nThe notion of a Pali gender is similar to (but not quite the same as) genders in some European languages. However, there are differences that it’s best to regard liṅga as a classification scheme or grammatical construct rather than what we may think of as “gender”. I like to think of it this way:\npulliṅga - the “major” or “default” type. Most nouns fall into this category. Generally associated with masculinity or masculine persons (but not always) napuṁsakaliṅga - the “special” type. Tend to be used for nouns that don’t quite fit with the notions of masculinity or feminity, or represent abstract concepts. itthiliṅga - the “minor” type, comparatively rare with respect to the other two types. Generally associated with feminity or feminine persons. Note that for the remainder of this book, we may refer to the above liṅga by the following symbols for brevity:\n🚹 = pulliṅga 🚻 = napuṁsakaliṅga 🚺 = itthiliṅga Ancient India was a patriarchal society, and men were regarded as the “major” component of society, doing activities considered important, hence the tendency is to associate important words to pulliṅga.\nNumber Like in English, Pali words are slightly different depending on whether they are used to refer to one thing vs many things.\n⨀ = ekavacana (singular) ⨂ = bahuvacana (plural) There used to be also a “dual” form but that is now largely obsolete and encountered in very rare instances. Examples include:\nto idh’āgato (these two having come) ubho (both) mātāpitu (father and mother) vibhatti (case endings) {54} Unlike English, words need to be “transformed” before they are used in a sentence. This is done by adding endings or “suffixes” to the word (vibhatti).\nAltogether there are seven types of vibhatti, and they are conveniently numbered 1 to 7 {55}:\nsymbol ⨀ ⨂ vibhatti ① si yo paṭhamā (“first”) ② aṁ yo dutiyā (“second”) ③ nā hi tatiyā (“third”) ④ sa naṁ catutthī (“fourth”) ⑤ smā hi pañcamī (“fifth”) ⑥ sa naṁ chaṭṭhī (“sixth”) ⑦ smiṁ su sattamī (“seventh”) You may note the 4th and 6th case endings are the same, which means in practice we can only tell which case is being used by context (more later). Notice also the plural endings for some of the cases are the same. Again, which case is being used can only be determined by context.\nLet’s start with an example. Suppose we have the word purisa (“man”, in the masculine gender or 🚹) and we want to use it in a sentence in singular form, and we wish to transform it using the 1st case ending (paṭhamāvibhatti). If we look up the above table, we should add the si ending (using rule of {55}):\npurisa + si → puriso\nWait, what happened? Why does the transformation not result in purisasi?\nThis is where additional rules comes into play. By rule of {83}, any word ending in a will be transformed into the 1st case by deleting the a and by rule of {104} replacing the si with o. Kaccāyana has a whole chapter of such rules.\nSo the transformation becomes:\npurisa + si\n→ purisa + si {83}\n→ puris + si(o) {104}\n→ puriso\nThe plural form undergoes a similar transformation:\npurisa + yo\n→ purisa + si {83}\n→ puris + yo(ā) {107}\n→ purisā\nThis does make things interesting, because the transformation result for every word then depends on:\nkāra’nta (word ending) liṅga (gender) ekavacana (singular) vs. bahuvacana (plural) vibhatti (desired case ending) Here is a table of purisa transformed in all the 7 cases and singular vs plural.\nnumber vibhatti ending transformation sutta result ⨀ ① si purisa + sio {104} puriso ⨂ ① yo purisa + yoā {107} purisā ⨀ ② aṁ purisa + aṁ purisaṁ ⨂ ② yo purisa + yoe {107} purise ⨀ ③ nā purisa + ena {103} purisena ⨂ ③ hi purisae + hi {101} purisehi ⨂ ③ hi purisae + bhi {99}-{101} purisebhi ⨀ ④ sa purisa + ssa {61} purisassa ⨂ ④ naṁ purisaā + naṁ {89} purisānaṁ ⨀ ⑤ smā purisa + smā purisasmā ⨀ ⑤ smā purisa + mhā {99} purisamhā ⨀ ⑤ smā purisaā {108} purisā ⨂ ⑤ hi purisae + hi {101} purisehi ⨂ ⑤ hi purisae + bhi {99}-{101} purisebhi ⨀ ⑥ sa purisa + ssa {61} purisassa ⨂ ⑥ naṁ purisaā + naṁ {89} purisānaṁ ⨀ ⑦ smiṁ purisa + smiṁ purisasmiṁ ⨀ ⑦ smiṁ purisa + mhi {99} purisamhi ⨀ ⑦ smiṁ purisae {108} purise ⨂ ⑦ su purisae + su {101} purisesu You will note that in some of the cases, there are multiple ways the word can be transformed. For example, singular purisa can be transformed in the 3rd case into either purisehi or purisebhi. Both are acceptable. Which should we use for a given sentence? It depends on the “sound” - a native speaker would have chosen the version that sounded the most pleasing, depending on surrounding words.\nThe rules can be quite complicated, so let’s not worry about them for now. In practice, you can rely on looking up a relevant table to determine the appropriate transformation (TBD). If you are just reading Pali, then with practice you will learn to recognise the various endings which will become familiar to you.\nReference A summary of the rules is provided in G: vibhatti Rules A much more important question to answer at this point is …\nWhy do we need vibhatti endings and what is their purpose? In English, when we see a sentence like\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nWe know that words “quick” and “brown” refers to the “fox”, which is the “subject” of the sentence, and “lazy” refers to the dog, which is the “object” of the sentence. The verb “jumped over” separates the subject and the object. Our brain automatically “collects” and “groups” the words, so we read the sentence as:\n(The quick brown fox) jumped over (the lazy dog).\nIn English, as we can see, word order is important. If we mixed the words up, the sentence becomes far harder to read:\nOver the quick lazy brown fox the dog jumped.\nThis sentence would imply quite a different meaning.\nIn Pali, all words with the same gender and the same case ending should be grouped together, and that’s how we distinguish which words belong to which entity. So the word order becomes far less important, we could mix the words up and the sentence would still have the same meaning!\nIn practice, the 1st case is usually reserved for the “most important” entity in a sentence, the 2nd for the “second most important” and so on.\nSo, in the above English sentence, were it to be translated the Pali, “the quick brown fox” would all be in the 1st case, and “the lazy dog” would all be in the 2nd case. If there are more entities, they would take the 3rd, 4th cases and so on.\nIn many sentences, the 1st case would usually refer to the entity or actor “performing” or “doing” the action (or, the “subject” of the sentence), and the 2nd case refers to the entity being impacted by the action (the “object”) of the sentence. Although this is a very common pattern, it is by no means rigid, and in theory any case ending can be used for any purpose. There are many examples in the Pali canon where the cases are used in unconventional ways. (TBD: need to include examples)\nVibhatti usage typical meanings {271}-{315} The following meanings are usually associated with each case. However, as noted above, these are conventions only, and the author of a sentence may choose to adopt an unconventional approach of assigning words to cases (perhaps for emphatic or stylistic reasons).\nvibhatti number role usage Pali term sutta ① ⨀/⨂ subject (active) subject, doer kattu/kattā {284} ① ⨀/⨂ address to address, to call ālapana {285} ② ⨀ to (object) object kamma {297} ② ⨂ till continuity for a certain period or distance accantasaṁyoga {298} ③ ⨀ by (subject) (passive) subject kattu/kattā {288} ③ ⨂ by/with supporting cause karaṇa {286} ③ ⨂ with/together company sahayoga {287} ③ ⨂ by means of/in regard of aspect or adjective visesana {292} ③ ⨂ due to/for reason kāraṇa {289} ④ ⨀/⨂ receivership/purpose recipient of action sampadāna {293} ⑤ ⨀ from source from which it occurs apādāna {295} ⑤ ⨂ for/due to reason kāraṇa {296} ⑥ ⨀ (possessive) of owner sāmi {301} ⑥ ⨂ among/out of selection for comparison niddhāraṇa {304} ⑥ ⨂ while/despite two concurrent actions anādara {305} ⑦ ⨀ at, in, on location/position adhikaraṇa/okāsa {302} ⑦ ⨂ among/out of selection for comparison niddhāraṇa {304} ⑦ ⨂ for/due to cause nimitta {310} ⑦ ⨂ while/when two concurrent actions lakkhaṇa {313} ⑦ ⨂ despite/while two concurrent actions anādara {305} Reference For a detailed explanation of the various meanings associated with each case ending, please refer to the next chapter:\n2: kāraka (word ending) meanings {271}-{315}\nNote You may find in Pali grammar books written in English the following nomenclature for the cases:\n① = “nominative” ② = “accusative” ③ = “instrumental” ④ = “dative” ⑤ = “ablative” ⑥ = “genitive” ⑦ = “locative” Note that these terms only partially reflect the possible meanings and roles associated with each case, so I would discourage using these terms. They can lead to confusion. However, these terms are common in Pali-English dictionaries so I encourage you to substitute the case number when you see these terms.\n⓪ ālapana (vocative) {57} English Pali textbooks often refer to a “vocative” case, but this is not recognised as a separate case but a variant of the 1st case. The usual case ending si (for 1st case singular) is instead called ga but the transformation rules are similar to si.\nExamples:\nbhoti ayye! (Oh madam!)\nbhoti kaññe! (Oh girl!)\nbhoti kharādiye! (Oh the girl named Kharādiya!)\nContrast this to the normal 1st case form of ayyā (🚺⨀①):\nsā ayyā (that lady)\nIn plural:\nbhotiyo ayyāyo (Oh Madams!)\n*️⃣ sabbanāma (pronouns) sabba means “all” so sabbanāma are “common” or “generic” nouns that can apply in “all’ situations.\nExamples of sabbanāma include the different vibhatti forms of ya (“who, what”), ta (“he/she/it”, “that”), eta (“this”), ima (“this”), amu (“that”), kiṁ (“what?”). One of the common usage of sabbanāma is as “pronouns”, where they can assume all genders to represent all things and persons of the different genders. But they can also function as adjectives, adverbs, honorifics and interrogatives.\nExamples:\nSabbanāma meaning ④ ⑥ sabba all sabbesaṁ sabbesānaṁ ya which yesaṁ yesānaṁ ta that tesaṁ tesānaṁ ima this imesaṁ imesānaṁ ka who kesaṁ kesānaṁ itara other itaresaṁ (others) itaresānaṁ (others) katama what katamesaṁ (of which ones) katamesānaṁ (of which ones) ⏏️ nipāta (particles) nipāta means “to fall. i.e. to be placed anywhere”, and refer to words that can be found placed in the beginning, in the middle or at the end of sentences and words, but not usually regarded as prefixes (see below).\nGenerally, the vibhatti endings of nipāta words are elided as these words are not related to other words in the sentence and therefore do not need to be matched with them. {221}\nHowever, in some instances, the vibhatti endings may be retained, if the nipāta word play a role in the sentence meaning.\nExamples tvaṁ panā’vuso! tumhe panā’vuso!\nyou / (no specific meaning) / friend\nyou (plural) / (no specific meaning) / friend\nHow about you, my friend? And the rest of you (plural)?\npadaso dhammaṁ vāceyya\nby word / dhamma / teach (causative, optative)\n(He) should teach and say Dhamma word by word.\nvihāraṁ • sve upagaccheyya\nto temple / tomorrow / should approach (optative)\n(He) should come to the temple tomorrow.\nThe following is a brief descriptive list of some nipāta words. Some are plain nipātas without any affix, while some are with indeclinable affixes. Some may even have a sort of vibhatti-ending in them or may still have traces of vibhattis. Please note that the implied meaning of elided vibhatti still remains in effect for some nipāta words such as yathā, tathā and evaṁ etc.\nnipāta meaning note yathā, tathā in a manner that, in such a way as combination of sabbanāma ya ta with indeclinable affix thā. The affix itself is ex- pressive of manner or mood. evaṁ thus, in this way, true as it is said, yes (many meanings) dutiyāvibhatti, very frequently used in Pāli texts khalu used mostly in a reported narrative kho mostly meaningless, but sometimes it may mean “only, really” a plain nipāta, found often in main Buddhist texts. Used together with atha evaṁ taṁ etc. tatra there a combination of sabbanāma ta with indeclinable affix tra atho in addition, besides atha now, then, later on, if Sometimes used in the beginning of a chapter or an episode, as an introductory or initiating word hi really, for, only Sometimes a meaningless particle tu in addition, only Also an expletive without meaning, sometimes added to be more emphatic in a statement ca also, too It is used to express some additional meaning in grammatical texts. Sometimes meaningless. Sometimes it has a lot of meanings when used after other nipāta particles vā similar to either or, in other ways In grammatical texts, sometimes it is used to express other option or method or inconsistency of a function. Sometimes with no particular meaning vo you It is sometimes a meaningless expletive haṁ, ahaṁ I the use of these two nipāta are seldom found in texts unless it means “I” alaṁ (a) enough, (b) suitable, (c) worthiness, (d) appropriateness, (e) ability Also, (f) sometimes used as a prohibition or rejection, usually used in combination with (1) a noun in instrumental case, or (2) tuṁ-infinitive Kita verbs or (3) an āya-infinitive in dative case nouns eva equal to “only” used next to the word it want to modify or restrict or confirm in its implied meaning. A plain nipāta. ho!, aho! these are expression of interjection or surprise. No vibhatti he!, ahe!, re!, are! “hey” Vocative nipāta particles, similar to “hey” in English. Usually vocative case vibhatti is applicable, but to be elided nipāta as prefixes However, there are quite a few nipāta that can be placed before some verbs or kita-affixed nouns and used in a way resembling prefixes.\ncombined nipāta word combined meaning antaradhāyati antara dhāyati (he) disappears āvikaroti āvi karoti (he) makes it openly, displays clearly pātubhavati pātu bhavati (it) arises visibly, i.e. appears sacchikaroti sacchi karoti (he) realizes, i.e. attains vinābhāvo vinā bhāvo separation, being apart sahacārī saha cārī the one who used be together, a friend punabbhavo puna bhavo being born again, rebirth 🔼 upasagga (prefixes) There are 20 upasagga words which are usually applied as prefixes to ākhyāta (verbs) and kita-affixed nouns (see below). Like nipāta, upasagga words also have their vibhatti endings elided, but in some cases where they are functioning as independent words (not attached to a verb or noun), they may retain their vibhatti endings.\nThere are three kinds of upasagga:\ndhātva’tthā’nuvattaka - those that follow the meaning of the root, without affecting its original meaning. dhātva’tthabādhaka - those that absolutely mean opposite of the root. These categorically change the original meaning of the root. dhātva’tthavisesaka - those that enhance the original meaning of the root by adding more specific meaning and flavour to it. Example:\nparābhavo\n🔼(parā) 🚹⨀①(bhava)\nopposite / to be, being loss, ruin\nHere are various words that can be formed from the word hara (“carrying”) together with various upasagga prefixes and the ṇa-suffix:\nexample upasagga meaning combined meaning pahāro pa specially carrying (instruments of harm) specially, i.e. beating, striking nihāro ni out taking out, evicting nīhāro nī out taking out, evicting (same as above) uhāro u up carrying up duhāro du bad carrying badly saṁhāro saṁ well carrying well vihāro vi specially carrying one’s body specially, staying, i.e. act of staying at a place using alternating bodily modes avahāro ava lowly,contemptuous, mean carrying in a mean manner, i.e. stealing anuhāro anu following, subsequent carrying accordingly parihāro pari all around carrying from all around adhihāro adhi specially, nicely carrying nicely abhihāro abhi toward carrying toward patihāro pati again carrying again suhāro su well carrying well āhāro ā toward carrying toward, food or meal atihāro ati beyond, excessive carrying beyond or excessively apihāro api downward carrying down apahāro api out carrying outward, i.e. removing upahāro upa near, close to carrying toward proximity, bringing up closer, carrying complementary gift etc. Reference For a listing of the detailed meanings that are associated with upasagga, please refer to F: upasagga meanings 🆎 samāsa (compound nouns) {316}-{343} Like German, Pali often combines many nouns to form a compound noun.\nThe following table summarises the major types of compound nouns, typical liṅga (gender) and examples:\ntype name liṅga example rule abyayībhāva Adverbial 🚻 so napuṁsakaliṅgo {320} kammadhāraya Appositional variable, or follow last component abhidheyavacano, paraliṅgo ca {341} digu Numeral Appositional 🚻 (usually ⨀ but can be ⨂) digusseʼkattaṁ {321} tappurisa Determinative variable ayañʼca tappuriso abhidheyavacanaliṅgo Rūpasiddhi {351} dvanda Copulative Mostly 🚻 but variable in some instances per last component samāhāre napuṁsakaṁ Moggalāna {20} Chapter 3 bahubbīhi Attributive variable per the contextual meaning of the aññapada (the external word of attributive meaning) bahubbīhi cāʼyaṁ abhidheyaliṅgavacano Rūpasiddhi {352} The rules for constructing a samāsa can be complex:\nrāja + putta (the King’s son)\n→ rāja + sa + putta (⨀⑥)\n→ rāja + sa + putta + si (⨀①)\n→ rāja(ññ) + sa(o) + putta + si {135}\n→ rāñño + putta + si(o) {83}\n→ rāñño + putto\n→ rāñño(ja) + putto(a) {317}\n→ rājaputta {318}\n→ rājaputta + si (⨀①)\n→ rājaputta + si(o) {104}\n→ rājaputta + o {83}\n→ rājaputto\nFortunately, resources such as the Digital Pali Dictionary can deconstruct compound words into their individual words, which helps the beginner to understand such words encountered. So there is less of a need to learn the complex rules associated with them.\n➡️ taddhita (affixes) {344}-{405} Various affixes can be added to a noun to create derived nouns and adjectives.\nCompare and contrast with English use of affixes such as “-al”, “-ly”, “-er”, “-or” etc. For example, “topic” vs “topical”, “true” vs “truly”.\nIn English, “navigate” is a verb, whereas “navigator” (with an “-or” affix) is a profession. Similarly, in Pali, nāvā is “boat”, nāvā with ṇika as an affix becomes nāviko (“traveller by boat”, or “sailor”). Note that the last vowel of the root and the ṇ are both elided, and then the noun is given the 🚹⨀① vibhatti ending.\nThe rules for constructing a tadhitta affixed noun can be rather daunting:\nvasiṭṭha + apacca (Vasiṭṭha’s son)\n→ vasiṭṭha + sa (⨀⑥) + apacca\n→ vasiṭṭha + s + sa + apacca {61}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + si (⨀①)\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + si(aṁ) {219}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apacca + aṁ {83}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + apaccaṁ (of Vasiṭṭha / son)\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + ṇa + apaccaṁ {344}\n→ vasiṭṭhassa + ṇa + apaccaṁ {317}\n→ vasiṭṭha + ṇa {396}\n→ vasiṭṭha + a {318}\n→ va(ā)siṭṭha + a {400}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + a {83}\n→ vāsiṭṭha {601}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + si (⨀①)\n→ vāsiṭṭha + si(o) {104}\n→ vāsiṭṭha + o {83}\n→ vāsiṭṭho\ntype meaning affix rule liṅga apacca patronymic ṇa {344} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇāyana, ṇāna {345} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇeya {346} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇi {347} 🚹 ṇika by vā of {347} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇava {348} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇera {349} 🚹 (but can be variable) Aneʼkattha various meanings ṇika {350}-{351} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇa {352} 🚹 (but can be variable) ima, iya {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) ima, iya, ika by ādi of {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) kiya by ca of {353} 🚹 (but can be variable) samūha collective grouping kaṇ, ṇa {354} 🚹 tā {355} 🚺 taʼdassathāna the source or the cause iya {356} 🚻 (but can be variable) upamā analogous similitude āyitatta {357} 🚻 tanʼnissitattha dependent nature and source la {358} 🚻 (mostly) bahula prominent nature ālu* {359} variable bhāva abstract conditions ṇya, tta {360} 🚻 ttana by tu of {340} 🚻 tā {360} 🚺 ṇa {361} 🚻 visesa comparisons tara, tama, isika, iya, iṭṭha {363} variable taʼdassaʼtthi possessed quality or inherent nature vī {364} 🚹 (but can be variable) so by ca of {364} 🚹 (but can be variable) sī {365} 🚹 (but can be variable) ika, ī {366} 🚹 (but can be variable) ra {367} 🚹 (but can be variable) vantu {368} 🚹 (but can be variable) mantu {369} 🚹 (but can be variable) ṇa {370} 🚹 (but can be variable) tappakati made up of something maya {372} variable *ka is added sometimes. eg. dayāluko\nWords with taddhita affixes are sometimes not recognised by Pali-English dictionaries, since these dictionaries may not cover the full range of possible affixes and their meanings. So it is probably worthwhile learning how to recognise taddhita affixed words and the associated meanings.\nReference For a summary of the taddhita affixes and associated meanings, please refer to H: taddhita (affixes) {344}-{405} Numbers Pali numbers have their own set of tadhikka affixes (to denote “first”, “second”, “third” etc.)\ntype name affix rule liṅga notes Saṅkhyā Taddhita Numbers ma {373} variable ī {375} 🚺 ti {378},{389} 🚺 derivative morpheme tiya {385} variable ka {392} 🚻 no Cardinals Ordinals 1 eka paṭhama 2 dvi, di, du, dve dutiya 3 ti or tri tatiya 4 catu or catur (before a vowel) catuttha, turīya 5 pañca pañcatha, pañcama 6 cha chaṭṭha, chatthama 7 satta sattha, sattama 8 aṭṭha aṭṭhama 9 nava navama 10 dasa, rasa, lasa, ḷasa dasama, dasī Abyaya (indeclinable affixes) These are undeclinable (and no liṅga), and often used as adverbs or adjectives.\naffix rule dhā {397} so by ca of {397} thā {398} thattā by tu of {398} thaṁ {398} khattuṁ Uṇādisutta {646} Abyaya affixes applied after Sabbanāma-nouns These are often used as a substitute or replacement for case endings (particularly ⑤ and ⑦), since they are indeclinable.

This is so prevalent other grammar books such as Moggalāṇa Vyākaraṇa and Rūpasiddhi created rules to accomodate them.\nVoices Like Sanskrit, Pali supports 3 different ways of expressing sentences, based on the “voice”:\nthe active voice (kattu) {444}-{452} the passive voice (kamma) the impersonal voice (bhāva) However, in Pali literature, bhāva (middle, or impersonal, voice) is seldom used, probably because most of the literature is based on the Buddha (or a disciple) “speaking” to a group of monks, which has then been transformed into a structure suitable for memorisation and chanting.\n🔴 Passive verb endings Vattamānā Vibhatti {440}-{443} A passive verb is created by using the attanopada (🔵) endings together with an infix of ya in between the root and the ending.\nNote that passive verbs can only be formed based on roots that can be expressed in a “passive” (kamma) sense - some roots can only result into “active” verbs and cannot be transformed this way.\nExample transformation (based on the root paca (to cook)):\npaca + ya + te {440}\n→ paca + y(cc)a + te {441}\n→ paccate (“is cooked”)\nThe full set of attanopada (🔵) endings of in the present tense vattamāna (▶️) across the 3 persons and plurality:\nvoice number person tense ending transformation result 🔴 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ te paca + y(cc)a + te paccate 🔴 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ ante paca + y(cc)a + ante paccante 🔴 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ se paca + y(cc)a + se paccase 🔴 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ vhe paca + y(cc)a + vhe paccavhe 🔴 👆 ⨀ ▶️ e pacca + y(cc)a + e pacce 🔴 👆 ⨂ ▶️ mhe paccca + y(cc)a + ā + mhe paccāmhe Because the middle voice is seldom used, rule {518} allows these verbs to be retransformed into “reversed” parassapada (🟢) endings:\nvoice number person tense ending transformation result 🔴 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ ti paccate + ti paccati 🔴 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ anti paccante + anti paccanti 🔴 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ si paccase + si paccasi 🔴 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ tha paccavhe + tha paccatha 🔴 👆 ⨀ ▶️ mi pacce + ā + mi paccāmi 🔴 👆 ⨂ ▶️ ma paccāmhe + ā + ma paccāma Typically we would use the parassapada (🟢) endings for passive verbs.\nOther examples (using different rules):\nkara (“to do”)\n→ kara + ya + te {440}\n→ kara + ī + ya + te {442}\n→ kara + ī + ya + te {521}\n→ karīyate (“is done”)\nvaḍha (“to grow”)\n→ vaḍha + ya + te {440}\n→ vaḍha + ya(ḍḍha) + te {443}\n→ vuḍḍhate (“is grown”)\n🟠 Causative verbs There are two types of causative verbs:\nCausative verb in the active voice Causative verb in the passive voice There 4 typical causative affixes (kārita) used to construct causative verbs {438}:\nṇe ṇaya ṇāpe ṇāpaya Just like for tadhikka noun affixes, the ṇ is typically elided when joined to a root, leaving the remaining letters. {523}\nVarious vowel gradation transformations may also take place when joining the affix to the noun as per rule {483}.\nExample transformation (based on the root paca (to cook)) and the causative affix ṇe:\npaca + ṇe + ti {438}\npaca + ṇe + ti {521}\n→ pac + ṇe + ti {523}\n→ pa(ā)c + e + ti {483}\n→ pāceti (\"(he) causes to cook”)\n🟠 Causative (active) verbs {438} The full set of causative versions of the vattamāna (▶️) forms of the root paca (to cook) using parassapada (🟢) endings:\nvoice number person tense ending causative transformation result irregular forms 🟠 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ ti ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + ti pāceti 🟠 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ ti ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + ti pācayati 🟠 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ ti ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + ti pācāpeti pacāpeti 🟠 🤟 ⨀ ▶️ ti ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + ti pācāpayati pacāpayati 🟠 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ anti ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + anti pācenti 🟠 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ anti ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + anti pācayanti 🟠 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ anti ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + anti pācāpenti pacāpenti 🟠 🤟 ⨂ ▶️ anti ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + anti pācāpayanti pacāpayanti 🟠 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ si ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + si pācesi 🟠 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ si ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + si pācayasi 🟠 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ si ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + si pācāpesi pacāpesi 🟠 🤘 ⨀ ▶️ si ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + si pācāpayasi pacāpayasi 🟠 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ tha ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + tha pācetha 🟠 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ tha ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + tha pācayatha 🟠 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ tha ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + tha pācāpetha pacāpetha 🟠 🤘 ⨂ ▶️ tha ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + tha pācāpayatha pacāpayatha 🟠 👆 ⨀ ▶️ mi ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + mi pācemi 🟠 👆 ⨀ ▶️ mi ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + mi pācayami 🟠 👆 ⨀ ▶️ mi ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + mi pācāpemi pacāpemi 🟠 👆 ⨀ ▶️ mi ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + mi pācāpayami pacāpayāmi 🟠 👆 ⨂ ▶️ ma ṇe pa(ā)ca + ṇe + ma pācema 🟠 👆 ⨂ ▶️ ma ṇaya pa(ā)ca + ṇaya + ma pācayama 🟠 👆 ⨂ ▶️ ma ṇāpe pa(ā)ca + ṇāpe + ma pācāpema pacāpema 🟠 👆 ⨂ ▶️ ma ṇāpaya pa(ā)ca + ṇāpaya + ma pācāpayama pacāpayāma Note: not all forms of the above are encountered in Pali literature - they represent the full theoretical set of causative forms that can be generated.\n🟠🔴 Causative passive verbs It is also possible to construct causative verbs in the passive voice, just by adding the passive ya affix after the causative affix.

Like kāraka (the syntax of case or vibhatti endings), sādhana affixed words can be associated with specific usage meanings.\nsādhana-affixed word can be associated with a voice (kattu, kamma, bhāva), in which case their usage can affect the “voice” of a sentence. This is especially true when sādhana-affixed word is used as a verb-noun, ie. it carries the “action” of a sentence.\nExample sentences of kattu sādhana-affixed words dānaṁ dinno devadatto\n🚻⨀②(dānaṁ) 🚹⨀①(⏬(ta)(dinno) devadatto)\nalms / gave (past participle) / Devadatta\nDevadatta gave alms.\nkumaro antepuraṁ gato\n🚻⨀②(antepuraṁ) 🚹⨀①(kumaro ⏬(ta)(gato))\nKing’s palace / prince / went (past participle)\nThe prince went into the King’s palace.\nso bhagavā sayam’pi cattāri saccāni buddho\n🚹⨀①(so bhagavā ⏬(ta)(buddho)) ⏏️(sayam api) 🚻⨂②(cattāri saccāni)\nthat / Bhagavā / understood (past participle) / by oneself / just / four / truths\nThat Bhagavā (Buddha) understood the four truths just by himself.\nExample sentences of kamma sādhana-affixed words buddhena dhammo desito\n🚹⨀③(buddhena) 🚹⨀①(dhammo ⏬(ta)(desito))\nby Buddha / dhamma / taught (past participle)\nThe Dhamma is taught by the Buddha.\nbhotabbo odano bhavatā\n🚹⨀①(⏬(tabba)(bhotabbo) odano) 🚹⨀③(bhavatā)\neaten (future passive participle) / rice / Your Honourable\nThat rice is to be eaten by Your Honourable.\nExample sentences of bhāva sādhana-affixed words tassa gītaṁ\n🚻⨀⑥(tassa) 🚻⨀①(🔽(ta)(gītaṁ))\nof that person / sung (past participle)\nSung of that person.\nsayitabbaṁ bhavatā\n🚻⨀①(⏬(tabba)(sayitabbaṁ)) 🚹⨀③(bhavatā)\neating (future passive particle) / by Your Honourable\nEating by Your Honourable.\nsādhana associated meanings and usage The associated meanings are rather weak compared to case endings (vibhatti) and can sometimes have no significant role.\nassociation example meaning rule usage kattu nāyako the leader (who leads) {527} netī’ti nāyako kamma kammaṁ work (which is being done) {531} karīyate tan’ti kammaṁ bhāva cāgo generosity (act of giving, sharing) {529} cajate, cajanaṁ vā cāgo karaṇa vinayo the discipline (by which one is trained) {527} vineti etenā’ti vinayo sampadāna dānīyo the recipient monk (to which alms should be given) databbo assā’ti dānīyo apādāna bhemo the fearsome object (from which people fear) {627} bhāyanti etasmā’ti bhemo adhikaraṇa ṭhānaṁ the place (where people stand) {548} tiṭṭhanti tasmin’ti Exercise Our first exercise, and also a celebration for finishing this chapter, is to translate the Saraṇattaya Kp 1 PTS 1. This is a very well known sutta commonly referred to as the Three Jewels (also known as the Triple Gem or Three Refuges) and traditionally recited by disciples of the Buddha as part of a ceremony by which one formally declares oneself a Buddhist.\nBuddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nSaṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nDutiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nTatiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi\nLet’s start by examining only the first line. Analysing each word by identifying the form of the vibhatti ending yields:\n🚹⨀②(buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ) 🟢⨀🤟▶️(gacchāmi)\nNote The notation used here is inspired by functional programming conventions. In mathematics, we refer to \\(f(x)\\) as the function \\(f\\) applying on the variable \\(x\\), so 🚹⨀②(x) means all words in x are in the 2nd case, singular (ekavacana) and pulliṅga in gender. Similarly, 🟢⨀🤟▶️(y) means all words in y are present indicative (vattamāna) active (parassapada) verbs in the singular (ekavacana), “first person” (in English, “third person”) form (paṭhama purisa). Translating each word into English yields:\nBuddha / refuge / (I) go\nNote that in Pali, all words in the same case refer to the same entity, so both “Buddha” and “refuge” refer to the same entity. In other words, the Buddha is the refuge and the refuge is the Buddha. In English, we can regard the equality as “Buddha as refuge”.\nSo, rearranging the words into a more idiomatic English sentence, we get:\nI go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the exercise, translate the remainder of the sutta. It’s okay to leave words like “dhamma” and “sangha” untranslated (and use non-accented characters) as these are well known terms to Buddhists.\nAnswer I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nI go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nI go to the Sangha as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nFor the second time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.\nFor the third time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\nNote that dutiyaṃ and tatiyaṃ are being used as nipāta. piis a nipāta meaning “too” or “also”.\nThe sentence structure of this sutta can also be represented as a pseudo UML class diagram:\nclassDiagram class sentence[\"dutiyampi/tatiyampi buddhaṃ/dhammaṃ/saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi\"] { \u003c\u003cvākya\u003e\u003e english((For the second/third time) I go to the Buddha/Dhamma/Sangha as refuge) } namespace saṅkhyāpūraṇa { class dutiyaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e ② english(second time) } class tatiyaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e ② english(third time) } } class pi { \u003c\u003cnipāta\u003e\u003e english(too) } namespace saraṇa { class buddhaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹⨀② } class dhammaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹⨀② } class saṅghaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹⨀② } } class saraṇaṃ { \u003c\u003cnāma\u003e\u003e 🚹⨀② english(as refuge) } class gacchāmi { \u003c\u003cākhyāta\u003e\u003e 🟢⨀🤟▶️ english(I go) } sentence *-- dutiyaṃ sentence *-- tatiyaṃ sentence *-- pi sentence *-- buddhaṃ : kamma sentence *-- dhammaṃ : kamma sentence *-- saṅghaṃ : kamma sentence *-- saraṇaṃ : kamma sentence *-- gacchāmi: kiriya buddhaṃ .. saraṇaṃ dhammaṃ .. saraṇaṃ saṅghaṃ .. saraṇaṃ We can also model the successive actions as a pseudo UML sequence diagram:\nsequenceDiagram participant ahaṃ as (ahaṃ) participant buddhaṃ participant dhammaṃ participant saṅghaṃ loop (paṭhama), dutiyampi, tatiyampi ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e buddhaṃ : gacchāmi buddhaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e dhammaṃ : gacchāmi dhammaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) ahaṃ -\u003e\u003e saṅghaṃ : gacchāmi saṅghaṃ -\u003e\u003e saraṇaṃ : (hoti) end Finally, the different states of the refuges can be modelled as a pseudo UML state diagram:\nstateDiagram-v2 state fork_state \u003c\u003cfork\u003e\u003e state join_state \u003c\u003cjoin\u003e\u003e [*] --\u003e fork_state : gacchāmi fork_state --\u003e buddhaṃ fork_state --\u003e dhammaṃ fork_state --\u003e saṅghaṃ buddhaṃ --\u003e join_state dhammaṃ --\u003e join_state saṅghaṃ --\u003e join_state join_state --\u003e saraṇaṃ saraṇaṃ --\u003e fork_state : dutiyampi, tatiyampi Conclusion Congratulations on finishing this chapter! It is compact and dense, and not every feature of Pali explained here will sink in initially. It may be worthwhile revisiting this chapter from time to time to check your understanding as you progress in your journey in learning Pali.\nThe good news is you now know enough of the basics of Pali to start reading the Tipiṭaka with the aid of a good dictionary, and looking up every word as you go along. You may encounter sentences that you can’t interpret very well, but that’s okay. Leave it for now, and study the next chapters, which will help you build confidence and skill in your ability to analyse sentences and deduce the correct meaning.\nRemember, the sentences in the Tipiṭaka are often repetitive and used in similar forms again and again. They are intentionally structured this way to assist in memorisation and chanting. So, once you have learnt how to correctly interpret a complex sentence, you may encounter it again and again and reading will become easier and easier over time.\nNext Chapter 2: kāraka (word ending) meanings ","categories":["palibook"],"description":"A concise overview of the Pali language covering key features\n","excerpt":"A concise overview of the Pali language covering key features\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/basics/","tags":["sandhi","nāmā","liṅga","vibhatti","alapana","sabbanāma","nipāta","upasagga","samāsa","taddhita","ākhyāta","saraṇattaya","kibbidhāna","uṇādi","sādhana"],"title":"1: The Pali Language Basics"},{"body":" SuttaCentral SuttaCentral contains early Buddhist texts, known as the Tipiṭaka or “Three Baskets”.

When wishes (good wishes) are expressed dative is used for the person for whom they are expressed “may there be (hotu) long life for him” “good luck to you” bhaddaṃ bhavato hotu “welcome to you” svāgataṃ bhavato hotu svāgataṃ (“welcome!”) indeclinables sotthi “safety”, “safely” and namo (“hail!”) infinitive of verbs overlaps in meaning with the dative of purpose. idiomatic construction: proper time for something, the opportunity for something etassa kālo “it is the time for this”, “it is the right time for this” akālo … yācanāya “it is not the right time for asking” yassa dāni kālaṃ maññasi “for which you think it is now (dāni) the right time” extremely common in saying (formally) goodbye (spoken by the host, not the guest - who for his part has made the excuse of pressure of work), being roughly equivalent to “well, if you really must go … \" used also by servants reporting to their master that preparations are completed, implying “you can start whenever you wish”, etc 6. sāmivacana Genitive case:\nmay often be translated by “of”, and serves as a “possessive” case denoting the “possessor” (sāmin) the whole of which the related word denotes a part (avayava) immediately precedes the word to which it relates rañño thūpo A construction with a possessive genitive is very often equivalent to an English construction with the verb “to have” idaṃ assa hoti “of him thus it is …” (or was, etc.), “he has this thought …”, “he thinks thus …” tassa evaṃ hoti an idiom consisting of the genitive of the word denoting the period + accayena expresses the time after which (or through the passage of which) something is done: sattāhassa accayena … pabbajissāma “after I have passed away”, “after my death/parinibbāna” mama + accayena = “after me” agent-genitive (“subjective genitive”): brāhmaṇassa pūjito (Soṇadaṇḍo) “(Soṇadaṇḍo was) honoured of (= by) the priest” yesaṃ … devā …adiṭṭhā “those … who have not seen … the gods (negative participle: a-)” (“of (= by) whom the gods are unseen”; Commentary explains yesaṃ by yehi) patient-genitive (“objective genitive”): ahaṃ … tassa yaññassa yājetā “I … (was) the performer of that sacrifice” substitute for the instrumental kumbhiṃ … pūraṃ … suvaṇṇassa “pot … full … of gold” used with certain indeclinables, such as: piṭṭhito - “behind” purato - “before”, “in front of” antarena - “between” me purato - “in front of me” kāyānam antarena - “between the bodies” uttaraṃ nagarassa - “north of the city” The “genitive absolute” consists of a noun (or pronoun) followed by a participle, both inflected in the genitive. This nexus stands apart from the other words of the sentence and means “while (the noun was doing the participle)” special sense of disregarding: “despite (the noun doing the participle)”, “under their very noses,” as when the participle means “seeing”, “looking on” telassa jhāyamānassa “as (while) the oil is burning” mātāpitunnaṃ … rudantānaṃ … pabbajito “though his parents were weeping, he went forth” (i.e. “despite their weeping”) useful for constructing a sentence with two agents, but the similarly constructed locative absolute (Lesson 16) is much more frequently used 8. āmantaṇavacana, ālapanavacana Vocative:\nused “enclitically”, i.e. it does not stand at the beginning of a sentence guṇanāma Adjective:\nWhen an adjective is common to two or more nouns it may agree with the sum of these (and be plural) or with the nearest. Thirdly the qualified words may be taken as collective and singular and the adjective be singular. Where the genders conflict, the masculine takes precedence over the feminine, the neuter over both. An adjective usually precedes the noun it qualifies, but when there are several adjectives with one noun very often only one adjective precedes and the rest follow the noun. A demonstrative pronoun relating to the same noun will precede the whole group. When an adjective, or (all the) adjectives, follows its noun this usually indicates that it is being “predicated” of the noun, or in other words that the attribute in question is being emphasized. sabbanāma Pronouns\nniyamita Personal and Demonstrative (incomplete TBD)\nAlthough the person is expressed by the inflection of the verb, the pronouns of the first and second persons are frequently used, giving a slight emphasis to the subject. The third person pronoun is less often used in this way. The third personal pronoun is used also as a demonstrative, meaning “that”, “it”, in three genders. It is generally used as what is known as an “anaphoric \" pronoun, that is to say it refers back to someone or something previously mentioned in a narrative. As opposed to the use in conversation and other direct speech of “pronouns of presence” referring to someone or something present (“this man”, “that jar”), these pronouns are called “pronouns of absence” because it is most often used to speak of someone or something in a story and therefore not present to the listeners. It may serve to connect the sentences of a narrative into a continuous paragraph or longer section. It is used also as an emphatic pronoun (in combination with another pronoun or occasionally with 1st person, for example in the expression so ‘haṃ “I” (literally “that I”). In combination with a noun it is again emphatic and may sometimes be translated “the” There being no “definite article” in Pali the demonstrative pronouns are sometimes used where English would use the definite article, and may sometimes be translated “the” rather than “he”, “that”, “this”, etc. Demonstrative pronouns must agree in number and gender (and case) with the nouns to which they refer. ākhyāta Verb\n--- markmap: zoom: false pan: false --- # ākhyāta ## lakāra (tense) ### vattamāna (present indicative) ### pañcamī (imperative) [mood] ### ajjatanī (aorist) [past] ### sattamī (optative) [mood] ### anāgatakāla (future) ### kālātipatti (conditional) ### kārita (causative) ## purisa (person) ### paṭhamapurisa (third person) ### majjhimapurisa (second person) ### uttamapurisa (first person) ## saṅkhyā (number) ### ekavacana (singular) ### bahuvacana (plural) kammaka Transitivity:\n--- markmap: zoom: false pan: false --- # kammaka -

It is structured using EBNF notation and presented as Syntax Diagrams (also known as “Railroad” diagrams).\nThe Pali Alphabet or Orthography (saññā) Phonemes {2} Pali is an oral language consisting of sounds, but can be transcribed in written form using a combination of phonemes. Overall, there are 41 phonemes, which are grouped as consonants and vowels. These phonemes can be rendered in various scripts, or using Roman letters.\n@startebnf title Phonemes (akkharā) phoneme = 33 * consonant (* byañjanā *) | 8 * vowel (* sarā *); @endebnf Vowels {3}-{5} The vowels can be short (1 mora in length) or long (2 morae). Some vowels can be short or long depending of circumstances.\n@startebnf title Vowels (sarā) vowel = short (* rassaṃ, light (lahu), one mora (mattā) in length *) | long (* dīghaṃ, heavy (garu), two mattā in length *) | variable (* can be long or short *); short = \"a\" | \"i\" | \"u\"; long = \"ā\" | \"ī\" | \"ū\"; variable = \"e\" | \"o\"; @endebnf Consonants {6}-{9} Consonants can be grouped.\n@startebnf Title Consonants (byañjanā) consonant = 25 * grouped (* vagga *) | 7 * ungrouped (* avaggā *) | 1 * niggahita (* niggahita *) ; grouped = 5 * ka_group (* kavagga, velar (guttural) *) | 5 * ca_group (* cavagga, palatal *) | 5 * dot_ta_group (* ṭavagga, retroflex *) | 5 * ta_group (* tavagga, dental *) | 5 * pa_group (* pavagga, labial *) ; ka_group = \"ka\" | \"kha\" | \"ga\" | \"gha\" | \"ṅa\" ; ca_group = \"ca\" | \"cha\" | \"ja\" | \"jha\" | \"ña\" ; dot_ta_group = \"ṭa\" | \"ṭha\" | \"ḍa\" | \"ḍha\" | \"ṇa\" ; ta_group = \"ta\" | \"tha\" | \"da\" | \"dha\" | \"na\" ; pa_group = \"pa\" | \"pha\" | \"ba\" | \"bha\" | \"ma\" ; ungrouped = \"ya\" | \"ra\" | \"la\" | \"va\" | \"sa\" | \"ha\" | \"ḷa\" ; niggahita = \"aṃ\" ; @endebnf Voicing The grouped consonants can be either voiced or unvoiced.\n@startebnf Title Voicing grouped = 7 * voiceless (* aghosā *) | 25 * voiced (* ghosā *) ; voiceless = \"ka\" | \"kha\" | \"ca\" | \"cha\" | \"ṭa\" | \"ṭha\" | \"ta\" | \"tha\" | \"pa\" | \"pha\" ; voiced = \"ga\" | \"gha\" | \"ṅa\" | \"ja\" | \"jha\" | \"ña\" | \"ḍa\" | \"ḍha\" | \"ṇa\" | \"da\" | \"dha\" | \"na\" | \"ba\" | \"bha\" | \"ma\" ; @endebnf Sentence structure Pali text consist of sentences which contain one or more words. Words can be nouns, verbs, prefixes and particles. There is no strictly defined word order in sentences, but is proto-typically subject-object-verb.\n@startebnf title Sentence Structure text = {sentence (* vakyā *)}; sentence = {word (* padajāti *)}- ; sentence = ?subject?, ?object?, ?verb? ; word = noun (* nāma *) | verb (* ākhyāta *) | prefix (* upasagga *) | particle (* nipāta *) ; @endebnf Nouns @startebnf title Noun types noun = substantive (* nāmanāma *) | adjective (* guṇanāma, visesana *) | pronoun (* sabbanāma *) | numeral (* saṅkhyā *) | complex_noun (* vutti *) ; substantive = common (* sādhārananāma *) | proper (* asādhārananāma *) ; @endebnf Nouns are constructed from a base, or stem. Kaccāyana refers to the nominal base as the liṅga, but this word is also used to refer to the grammatical gender of nouns. liṅga technically means defining “characteristic” or “attribute” and hence the term is appropriate for both, as the defining characteristic of a noun is the base together with the gender. Other words that can be used to represent the base are pāṭipadika or sadda.\nA fully formed noun-word is constructed by combining the base with optional prefixes, infixes, affixes and suffixes. The final suffix is the inflectional-ending and expresses the syntactic case (relationship of the noun to other parts of a sentence), number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter).\n@startebnf title Noun formation noun = {prefix (* upasagga *)}, {root (* dhātu *)}-, [infix (* āgama *)], {affixes}- (* paccaya *) ; affixes = (primary_affix (* kitapaccaya *) | secondary_affix (* taddhitapaccaya *)), noun_ending (* vibhatti *) ; noun_ending = gender (* liṅga*), multiplicity (* vacana *), syntactic_case (* vibhatti *) ; gender = ?🚹 masculine (pulliṅga)? | ?🚺 feminine (itthiliṅga)? | ?🚻 neuter (napuṃsakaliṅga)? ; multiplicity = ?⨀ singular (ekavacana)? | ?⨂ plural (bahuvacana)? ; syntactic_case = case0 | case1 | case2 | case3 | case4 | case5 | case6 | case7 ; @endebnf Semantic cases Semantic cases (kāraka) represent the relationship between words in a sentence (representing various participants) in the context of an action (verb). Pali has 7 different semantic cases, in addition to a vocative case which is sometimes denoted as an 8th case.\nThere is a strong association between semantic cases and syntactic cases, but the association is not an equivalance as a semantic case can be represented by more than one syntactic case, and a syntactic case can be used to represent more than one semantic case.\n@startebnf semantic_case = vocative (* ālapana *) | nominative (* kattar, agent or \"doer\" of action *) | accussative (* kamma, object or \"deed\" of action *) | instrumental (* karaṇa, means or implement of agent *) | dative (* sampadāna, beneficiary of action *) | ablative (* apādāna, source or cause of action *) | genitive (* sāmi, owner of object *) | locative (* okāsa, place of action *) ; @endebnf Verbs Technically, verbs in Pali are finite verbs, conjugated by applying verb endings which represent the perspective and voice of the actor, multiplicity, and the mood/tense of the action.\nInfinitives, participles (past, present, future), absolutives and other forms of words considered as verbs in other languages are technically nouns in Pali - they are created by combining a verbal stem (root) with an affix (kita or kicca) and then inflected/declined by adding a noun ending.\n@startebnf title Verb types verb = Bhuvadi | Rudhadi | Divadi | Svadi | Kiyadi| Tanadi | Curadi; voice_affixes = Kattupaccaya | Kammapaccaya | Bhavapaccaya | Hetukattupaccaya | Hetukammapaccaya; @endebnf @startebnf title Verb formation verb = {prefix (* upasaggo *)}, {root (* dhātu *)}-, [infix (* āgamo *)], voice_affixes (* paccaya *), verb_ending (* vibhatti *) ; verb_ending = case_relation (* kāraka *), person (* purisa *), multiplicity (* vacana *), (tense (* kāla *) | mood); time = past | present | future ; case_relation = ?Kattukaraka : Active voice? | ?Kammakaraka : passive? ; person = third_person (* paṭhamapurisa *) | second_person (* majjhimapurisa*) | first_person (* uttamapurisa *) ; multiplicity = ?⨀ singular (ekavacanaṃ)? | ?⨂ plural (bahuvacanaṃ)? ; voice = ?parassapada : active, action favours non-agent? | ?attanopada : reflective, action favours self/object?; mood = ?pañcamī : Imperative, command or wish? | ?sattamī : Optative, permission or thought? | ?kālātipatti : Conditional, should have happened except for ...? ; tense = ?vattamānā : Present tense (paccupannakāla)? | ?parokkhā : Perfect, actions completed that was not witnessed? | ?hīyyattanī : Imperfect, past action excluding today? | ?ajjattanī : Aorist, past action completed today? | ?bhavissantī : Future tense? ; @endebnf Complex nouns Complex nouns include compounds, verbal derivatives (primary) and nominal derivatives (secondary).\nDerivatives are nouns formed by combining either a verbal or nominal stem with an affix, and then inflected/declined by applying noun endings.\n@startebnf complex_noun = compound (* samāsanāma *) | noun_derivative (* taddhitanāma *) | verb_derivative (* kitanāma *) ; compound = ?avyayībhāva : Adverbial? | ?kammadhāraya : Apposidonal? | ?digu : Numerical? | ?tappurisa : Determinative? | ?bahubbīhi : Relative? | ?dvandva : Copulative? ; verb_derivative = verb_stem (* liṅga *), primary_affix, noun_ending ; noun_derivative = noun_stem (* liṅga *), secondary_affix (* taddhita *), noun_ending ; primary_affix = kita | kicca | unadi; @endebnf Prefixes Prefixes can be used as words in a sentence (in which case they are indeclinable), or embedded in another word (in which case they act as prepositions and form part of the word).\nParticles @startebnf (* avyaya *) indeclinable = particle (* nipāta *) | prefix (* upasagga *); particle = conjunction | preposition | adverb | indeclinable ; @endebnf References This appendix is drawn upon information provided in the following sources\nKaccāyana Pāli Vyākaraṇaṁ (Kaccāyana Pāli Grammar), Vols I and II, A.

Kaccāyana itself draws from multiple earlier sources such as:\nPrātiśākya treatises, Vedic phonetics (various authors) Pānini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī (“Eight Lessons”) Kātantravyākarana by Šarvavarman So, Kaccāyana draws and inherits from a long tradition of Sanskrit grammar and technical terms. According to Pind (2012) approximately 215 sutta from Kaccāyana are based on Kātantravyākarana, and approximately 300 sutta are modifications from Panini. However, more than half the sutta in Kaccāyana are not derived from Sanskrit, so the grammar as a whole does not reflect Sanskrit usage and vocabulary.\nKaccāyana structure mindmap Kaccāyana I.

It is all about adding particles to a base, and then replacing them if/when needed.\nTo understand vidhi-s, we should keep in mind the following code of case endings:\nABL. = “after X” GEN. = “instead of X” NOM., ACC. = “X”, ādesa (“replacement”) LOCATIVE1: “before X” LOCATIVE2: “in the sense of X” Affixation (paccaya) timeline Left : Ablative : After X A : Nominative : Affix A is inserted @startebnf affixation = ablative (* After X *), nominative (* A is inserted *); ablative = (nominal_base (* liṅga *) | verbal_base (* dhātu *)), \"smā\" ; @endebnf Replacement (ādesa) timeline Left : Ablative : Ablative : Ablative : After X A : Genitive : Nominative : Nominative : Replace A B : Nominative : Nominative : Accusative : With B Right : Locative : Locative : Locative : Before Y Marker : ca (and) : api (also) : vā (or) : kvaci (sometimes) : na (not) : niccam (required) Semantic : Locative : \"in the sense of ...\" @startebnf replacement = [ablative (* After X *)], ( ( genitive (* Instead of A *), nominative (* replace with B *) ) | ( nominative (* Replace A *), nominative (* with B *) ) | ( nominative (* A *), accusative (* becomes B *) ) ), [locative (* Before Y *)], [marker], [semantic (* \"in the sense of\" *)]; marker = \"ca\" (* and *) | \"api\" (* also *) | \"vā\" (* or *) | \"kvaci\" (* sometimes *) | \"na\" (* not *) | \"niccam\" (* required *) ; @endebnf Elision (lopaṃ) timeline Left : Ablative : After X A : Nominative : Instead of A lopaṃ: Accusative : elision Right : Locative : Before Y @startebnf elision = [ablative (* After X *)], genitive (* Instead of A *), \"lopaṃ\" (* elision *), [locative (* Before Y *)]; @endebnf Structure of a rule (sutta) @startebnf rule = aphorism (* sutta *), gloss (* vutti *), {example} (* udāharaṇa *), {counter_example} (* kimudāharaṇa *), [application] (* payojana *), [result] (* gahaṇaphala *); @endebnf stateDiagram-v2 direction LR [*] --\u003e upasagga [*] --\u003e dhātu upasagga --\u003e upasagga upasagga --\u003e dhātu dhātu --\u003e paccaya ","categories":["palibook"],"description":"An overview of Kaccāyana and interpretation guidelines\n","excerpt":"An overview of Kaccāyana and interpretation guidelines\n","ref":"/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/kaccayana/","tags":["Kaccāyana"],"title":"M: Overview of Kaccāyana"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/buddhavacana/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"--- markmap: maxWidth: 500 initialExpandLevel: 2 --- # saḷāyatanavibhaṅgo ## cha ajjhattikāni āyatanāni ### cakkhāyatanaṁ ### sotāyatanaṁ ### ghānāyatanaṁ ### jivhāyatanaṁ ### kāyāyatanaṁ ### manāyatanaṁ ## cha bāhirāni āyatanāni ### rūpāyatanaṁ ### saddāyatanaṁ ### gandhāyatanaṁ ### rasāyatanaṁ ### phoṭṭhabbāyatanaṁ ### dhammāyatanaṁ ## cha viññāṇakāyā ### cakkhuviññāṇaṁ ### sotaviññāṇaṁ ### ghānaviññāṇaṁ ### jivhāviññāṇaṁ ### kāyaviññāṇaṁ ### manoviññāṇaṁ ## cha phassakāyā ### cakkhusamphasso ### sotasamphasso ### ghānasamphasso ### jivhāsamphasso ### kāyasamphasso ### manosamphasso ## aṭṭhārasa manopavicārā ### cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati ### Sotena saddaṁ sutvā #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati ### ghānena gandhaṁ ghāyitvā #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati ### jivhāya rasaṁ sāyitvā #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati ### kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṁ phusitvā #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ rūpaṁ upavicarati ### manasā dhammaṁ viññāya #### somanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ dhammaṁ upavicarati #### domanassaṭṭhānīyaṁ dhammaṁ upavicarati #### upekkhāṭṭhānīyaṁ dhammaṁ upavicarati ## chattiṁsa sattapadā ### cha gehasitāni somanassāni - Cakkhuviññeyyānaṁ rūpānaṁ iṭṭhānaṁ kantānaṁ manāpānaṁ manoramānaṁ lokāmisapaṭisaṁyuttānaṁ paṭilābhaṁ vā paṭilābhato samanupassato pubbe vā paṭiladdhapubbaṁ atītaṁ niruddhaṁ vipariṇataṁ samanussarato uppajjati somanassaṁ.

My intent is to rely as much on the original Pāli terms and text where possible, and only rely on English translations as an interim aid to understanding.\nThe initial release features minimum content, relating to some summaries of key concepts from the Basket of Discourses (Sutta Piṭaka) and some Pāli language reference materials.

In any case, the commentary indicates the relevant option marker is kvaci. ↩︎\nnavā is generally interpreted by most translations (and also other grammatical books) to be an alternative to kvaci, to cancel out kvaci in the preceeding rule, however, I have decided to interpret it as a more restrictive form of optionality, hence have translated it as “rarely”. In any case, the vutti for rule 22 continues the use of navā as the applicable option marker, hence I believe it has a different meaning than kvaci. ↩︎\nI have interpreted ca not as an option marker but an intention to signify two operations are included in this rule: a transformation of eva into riva as well as a shortening of the preceeding long vowel. The relevant option marker is navā inherited from the previous rule, which is made clear in the vutti. ↩︎\n","categories":["Kaccāyana","sandhikappa","dutiyakaṇḍa"],"description":"This section

and articles. My intent is to rely as much on the original Pāli terms and text where possible, and only rely on English translations as an interim aid to understanding. About Me Chris Tham, photo taken at Nan Tien Temple in 2014 My name is Chris Tham. I discovered Buddhism in my early teens, whilst visiting Singapore during a school vacation. An uncle took us to a Buddhist temple, and afterwards gave me a book called \"What Buddhists Believe\" by Dr K Sri Dhammananda. I read the whole book overnight and it all made sense to me, so I informally became a Buddhist after that.\nMuch later on, I stumbled upon another book called \"The Buddha's Explanation of the Universe\" by C.P. Ranasinghe which purports to explain in greater explain \"Life, the Universe, and Everything\" from a Buddhist perspective. These were taken from the Abhidhamma section of the Tipiṭaka. I wanted to study the original texts directly but at that time translations to English were not easily available. For years, I asked anyone who was visiting India or Sri Lanka to buy me books on the Abhidhamma and over the years I have a collected a few works but never the discourses themselves.\nWith a brand new translation of the Tipiṭaka now available on SuttaCentral I can finally study the actual text of the Tipiṭaka which has resulted in the creation of this site.\nAbout this website This website is hosted on Github using Github Pages.

It also contains a textbook and other references for learning Pāli, the language that the Tipiṭaka is written in.\nWe do not know what the Buddha’s native language was. Some scholars have speculated that it was either Magadhi or Magadhi-Prakrit considering his family background and where he was born. The Buddha probably preached the Dhamma in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Buddhist teachings were preserved and transmitted orally, and modern scholars believe over time Pāli evolved as a mix of the above languages, with the meanings of some words adapted to have specific Buddhist significance. As such, Pāli is a partially invented language used for the transmission and preservation of Buddhist theology, and is the canonical language of Buddhism.\nI have always wanted to study Buddhism, and in particular the Pāli Canon or Tipiṭaka, in Pāli rather than translated into English. This website summarises what I have learnt. I have tried to use diagrams such as mind maps whenever possible, and link to the actual discourses are available on SuttaCentral.\n𑀇𑀤𑀫𑀯𑁄𑀘 𑀪𑀕𑀯𑀸𑁇 𑀅𑀢𑁆𑀢𑀫𑀦𑀸 𑀢𑁂 𑀪𑀺𑀓𑁆𑀔𑀽 𑀪𑀕𑀯𑀢𑁄 𑀪𑀸𑀲𑀺𑀢ṁ 𑀅𑀪𑀺𑀦𑀦𑁆𑀤𑀼𑀦𑁆𑀢𑀺𑁇\nIdamavoca bhagavā.
