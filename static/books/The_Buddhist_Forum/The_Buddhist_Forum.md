*The Buddhist Forum* was first published by the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (issues numbered 1 through 5), and by the Institute of Buddhist Studies, Tring, UK (number 6). The series made public research initially presented as part the series of seminars hosted by SOAS between 1987 and 1997, also known as the Buddhist Forum. Over time the issues have run out of print, and become increasingly rare. It is, therefore, with great pleasure that as a result of an agreement between the Institute of Buddhist Studies of Tring, UK, and the Institute of Buddhist Studies, Berkeley, California, USA, that we are here able to present electronic reproductions of all six volumes.
