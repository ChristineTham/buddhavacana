# Publisher's Note 

The Buddhist literature generally consists of the sayings of the Buddha and the works by subsequent scholars, which are termed as Sūtra and Śāstra respectively. These works pertaining to various schools are originally available mainly in three languages: Pali, Sanskrit and Apabhramśa. The Pali Canon is the canon of Theravādins for the Tripitaka of Theravādins is available in Pali. Following the terminology and norms of the Sanskrit grammarians, the Theravādins have also composed grammars of the Pali language.

The present work, submitted for the award of the Ph.D. degree in Pali from the University of Pune, is an attempt to study the technical terminology and the technique of the three Pali grammars from the comparative point of view and is an initial step in making a detailed comparison of the Pali grammatical treatises with their Sanskrit counter-parts. The work presents a brief historical sketch of the Pali grammatical tradition and introduces three Pali grammars viz. the Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, the Saddamīti and the Moggallāna Vyākaraṇa along with the three Sanskrit grammars viz. the Aṣtādhyāyī, the Kātantra Vyākaraṇa and the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa. It studies in all 166 technical terms classified into eight sub-sections according to the different linguistic categories such as: the phonetic terminology, the terminology related to the morphophonemic changes, the morphological terminology, etc. Each term is explained according to its definition and usage. It is then compared with its Sanskrit counterpart in the Aṣtādhyāyī, the Kātantra Vyākaraṇa and the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa. An attempt is also made to trace its origin and development in the Sanskrit tradition and to compare the overall technique and different technical devices used by the Pali and the Sanskrit grammarians. The study also records some observations drawn from the data collected for this purpose.

The present work reveals the fact that the Pali Aṭthakathās of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta and Dhammapāla show the existence of a limited indigenous Pali grammatical terminology different
from that of Sanskrit and that around $80 \%$ of the terms used by the Pali grammarians come from Sanskrit sources. While many of these are familiar from the standard grammar books (Aṣtādhyāyī, Kātantra Vyākaraṇa, Cāndra Vyākaraṇa, and their respective commentaries), others are drawn from the Brāhmaṇas, Yāska's Nirukta, the Prātiśākhyas and the Śikṣā literature.

While there are several works studying the Tripitakas from various points of view, there are not many works doing a comparative study of the Pali and the Sanskrit grammars. Prof. Mahesh Deokar therefore deserves compliments for undertaking this type of study. The Institute intends to promote the study of Pali along with Tibetan and Sanskrit and is pleased to publish this work as a concrete step in that direction. We sincerely wish that the publication of this work will be welcomed by the readers and will motivate further study in this rather unexplored field.

The present work is not my sole achievement, but rather the culmination of the efforts of many people who have aided me in innumerable ways throughout my academic career. First and foremost, I must pay my humble respects to my guides, Prof. Dr. M. G. Dhadphale and Prof. Dr. Saroja Bhate. In addition to spending countless hours reading Pali texts with me, Prof. Dhadphale provided me with an overall perspective on the Pali language, gleaned from years of painstaking scholarship in the field. Prof. Bhate has been a personal and professional support from the earliest stages of my post-graduation and I have benefited from her expertise and insights in the field of Sanskrit grammar in general and the Pāninian grammar in particular. I am thankful to the (Late) Dr. Mrs. Pushpa Kale, Dr. Shilpa Sumant and Mrs. Sunila Gondhalekar for kindly preparing the audiotapes of the Pali grammatical works, which was necessary due to my visual impairment. I acknowledge the help given by Prof. Dr. Thomas Oberlies of Göttingen in acquiring the research material unavailable in India. Dr. E. Kahrs of Cambridge has inspired and guided me during my study of this vast subject. In the initial stage, he helped me by making available the necessary material for the present work. He was also kind to write a foreword to this book. I am thankful to Dr. Kahrs and Dr. Margaret Cone, for carefully examining my work and making valuable suggestions. I would also like to express my indebtedness to all the eminent scholars whose books and translations I have availed myself of in my own research, especially K. C. Chatterjee, Eivind Kahrs, S. M. Katre, O. H. Pind, L. Sarup and L. N. Tiwari.

Last but not least, I must acknowledge the assistance received from my wife, Dr. Lata, who has been a great help to me in all the stages of this research; and also my parents, my brother and my inlaws who have helped me in many ways.
I am grateful to Prof. Geshe N. Samten, Director, Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath, Varanasi, for showing keen interest in my research and accepting this work for publication. I am thankful to the Publication Unit of the Institute for beautifully printing this work.

# Foreword 

Dedicated to the study of their canonical literature, Theravāda Buddhists produced a number of grammars of the Pāli language. The Kaccāyanavyākaraṇa or Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, named after its author Kaccāyana, was composed in Sri Lanka some time after Buddhaghosa, who clearly did not know of it, and before its earliest known commentary, the Mukhamattadīpanī, written in probably the eleventh century. The Kaccāyana grammar triggered off a long tradition of commentaries, as well as a series of expanded, revised versions of it, such as the Rūpasiddhi and the Bālāvatāra.

A separate school of grammar emerged in Sri Lanka through the work of Moggallāna or Moggallāyana who composed his Moggallānavyākaraṇa or Saddalakkhaṇa during the reign of Parakkamabāhu in Anurādhapura, that is to say, some time between 1153 and 1186. The colophon of the work says that it was composed after Parakkamabāhu had purged the Sangha of all heretical monks, an event that can be dated to 1165.

As a third major work on Pāli grammar we find the Saddanīti of the Burmese monk Aggavarnisa who is said to have completed his monumental work in the kingdom of Pagan in the year 1154. There are claims that a copy of his work was taken to Sri Lanka a few years after its completion where it is said to have been received with enthusiastic admiration at the celebrated Mahāvihāra, and declared superior to any grammatical work written by Sinhalese scholars. However, no Pāli commentary on it is known to us and the only work that resembles a commentary on it is its Burmese nissaya, a translation type of commentary paraphrasing the Pāli text while adding information in Burmese.

Now, if a grammar becomes influential it will inevitably affect not only the composition of subsequent literature but also the way in which earlier literature is perceived. That so little work has been done on the Pāli grammarians is therefore surprising when one
considers how important some of these grammars are not only for determining the state of Pāli language and scholarship in twelfthcentury Burma and Sri Lanka, but also for diagnosing the effect they may have had on the transmission and interpretation of the Pāli canon, and on the composition of subsequent Pāli literature. At the time of Aggavarnisa and Moggallāna the Aṭthakathās were written, but probably not all the Tīkās and certainly not the later Tīkās (the Navaṭikās) and the Anuțikās.

It is accordingly likely that the Pāli we encounter today is a function of the Pāli of the twelfth century and that knowledge of the Burmese and Sinhalese philology of the time is indispensable if we are to arrive at a Pāli of linguistic interest, to use a phrase coined by Helmer Smith, the editor of the Saddamiti. This also leads us to the crucial question of what sources influenced the Pāli grammarians. The short answer to this is simple. Different though they may be in scope and in style, the Pāli grammars are all heavily indebted to the glorious traditions of Sanskrit vyākaraṇa, grammar and philosophy of language. The Kaccāyana grammar is strongly influenced by the Pāṇinian tradition and by the Kätantra, a Buddhist Sanskrit grammar. Drawing upon earlier Pāli grammars and the sources built upon by them, the Moggallānavyākaraṇa is in addition heavily influenced by the Cāndravyākaraṇa of the Buddhist grammarian Candragomin. Aggavarnisa, in turn, incorporated most of the non-Vedic rules of Pāṇini's Aṣtādhyāyī, as well as all the Kaccāyana rules and most of the material from the Kaccāyanavutti, which would also incorporate the influence of the Kätantra. Aggavarnisa too knew of the Cāndravyākaraṇa, but maybe more importantly he was clearly familiar with a tradition going back to the Kāśikāvṛtti. It seems possible to assume that he also knew of one or both of its commentaries, the Nyāsa and the Padamarijarī. Moreover, he drew heavily on Bhartṛhari's Vākyapadīya, probably through Helārāja's commentary. Aggavarnisa also discusses vārttikas met with in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya, and makes use of different sections of that text for various purposes, possibly via access in some form to the commentary of Kaiyaṭa, the Pradīpa. Tracing such sources and
influences, and determining the usage of technical terms and techniques is not straightforward, and there remains a lot of work to be done.

It is therefore maybe not so surprising in the end that relatively little work has been done on the Pāli grammarians considering the difficulties such study involves. It requires, of course, a solid grasp of Pāli and a thorough knowledge of the Pāli canon, but also an intimate knowledge of Sanskrit vyäkaraṇa in all its richness and variety. Add to that the fact that the Pāli grammarians often have to address particularly tricky passages or usages in the Pāli canon, and that they sometimes in such contexts come up with rather puzzling statements. A single example will suffice to illustrate this. For a Sanskrit grammarian, the bhāvaprayoga - the impersonal passive or stative usage - would be illustrated by a construction such as devadattena supyate, literally 'it is being slept by Devadatta'. Aggavarnsa, on the other hand says that it is a construction wherein the verb is identical in form with a passive specified without an object, and then claims that not only can the agent be expressed by the instrumental or the nominative case but that, in fact, 'on the view of the Jina' the nominative alone is to be used: ${ }^{1}$

Akkharacintakā pana ṭhīyate bhūyate ti ādisu bhāvavisayesu karaṇavacanam eva payuñjati "nanu nāma pabbajitena sunivatthena bhavitabbañ supārutena ākappasampannenā"ti ādisu viya; tasmā tesañ mate tena ubbhavīyate ti karaṇavacanena yojetabbañ, jinamate pana "so bhūyate" ti ādinā paccattavacanen' eva. Saccasañkhepappakaraṇe hi Dhammapālācariyena, Niddesapāliyañ pana Dhammasenāpatinā, Dhajaggasutte Bhagavatā ca bhāvapadañ paccattavacanāpekkhavasen' uccāritañ.

Now, the grammarians employ only the instrumental case in the domain of bhāva, such as thīyate, bhūyate, etc., as in: 'surely a wandering monk should be ${ }^{1}$ well dressed, properly covered, suitably attired', etc. Therefore, on their view, in the expression tena ubbhavīyate it should only be constructed with the instrumental case. But on the view of the Jina [it should be constructed] only with the nominative as in so bhūyate. For in the Saccasañkhepappakaraṇa by the teacher Dhammapāla, in the text of the Niddesa by Dhammasenāpati, and in the Dhajaggasutta by the Blessed One, a bhāva-word has been stated with [a syntactic] expectancy for the nominative case.

Aggavarnsa himself refers the example so bhūyate to the Saccasañkhepa, a text that belongs to a group of Abhidhamma manuals known in Burma as Let-than, the Little-finger Manuals. Its author, Dhammapāla, is hard to identify and date, but it seems clear that he must be reasonably close to Aggavarnsa in time. This makes it likely that the type of Pāli employed by Dhammapāla must be reasonably close to that used by Aggavarnsa and it is therefore surprising that he quotes this puzzling example without reservation. Normally he takes his examples from canonical literature. The form bhūyate occurs at Saccasañkhepa 63d, and is in fact the only occurrence of the form bhūyate in this text. The verse, which seems to deal with rūpa (cf. verse 40), ends: aggijādi pubbe va bhūyate '[rūpa] that is produced by fire is already existing' (?). A passive form of the verbal root bh $\bar{u}$, if that is what we are dealing with, is in any case hard to distinguish from an active one in meaning.

1 Literally: 'by a wandering monk it should be ...'. To a Sanskritist it is not surprising that Aggavarnsa resorts to the frequently occurring future passive participle to illustrate a bhāva-construction, here constructed with the instrumental case as one would expect.
Few scholars today are better equipped to undertake and guide serious study of the Pāli grammarians than Professor Mahesh Deokar, and that his work is published and hence made available to the scholarly community represents a landmark in Pāli scholarship. Such a thorough study of the technical terms and techniques of both Pāli and Sanskrit grammars takes the study of the Pāli significantly forward and lays the foundations for other scholars to continue work in this field. It also bodes well for the future of Pāli studies in India, now significantly enhanced by the establishment of a Department of Pāli in the University of Pune, with Professor Deokar as its Chair.

# Preface 

In 1863, James Elwis wrote an introduction to Kaccāyana's grammar, which marks the beginning of the modern study of the indigenous Pali philology. In 1871, E. Senart published a critical edition of the complete Kaccāyana grammar. In this edition, the sütrus were given in the Devanāgarī script whereas the commentary was in the Roman script. It included a French translation of the text and critical notes. This was an important work. However, it had its own limitations as a number of Pali texts including the important grammatical works and their commentaries were still unpublished. ${ }^{1}$

In 1882, G. E. Fryer wrote an elaborate note on the Kaccāyana (Kacc) in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1902, R. O. Franke wrote an outline of the history and the development of the indigenous Pali grammars entitled 'Geschichte und Kritik der einheimischen Pāli-Grammatik und Lexicographie'. This monograph though important had its own limitations because at that time Franke did not consider some important grammatical treatises, namely, the Mukhamattadīpanī (Mmd), the Kaccāyananiddesa (Kacc-nidd), the Moggallānapañjikā (Mogg-p) etc. His work was mainly based on the Kacc, the Kaccāyanavutti (Kacc-Vu), the Rūpasiddhi (Rūp), the Moggallānavyākaraṇa (MV), the Moggallānavutti (MVu), and fragments of the Saddamiti (Sadd). The limited textual basis of Franke's study sometimes made him draw conclusions, which are no longer valid. Since then, a number of important works on the Pali grammar have been published.

During 1928-1930, H. Smith published his monumental work 'Saddanīti La Grammaire Palie D'Aggavarnsa' in three volumes. During 1949-1954, Smith supplemented his critical edition with two volumes of tables comprising a. lists of texts quoted (Index

Locorum), b. suttas (Index Aphorismorum), c. verbal roots (Index Radicum), d. various elements of word formation (Index Formantium), e. the very useful conspectus terminorum (saññāmālikā) and metricorum, and f. an index to the whole work (Index Verborum). The last, i. e., the index was incomplete and was completed later by N. Simonsson in 1966.

In 1931, the grammar of Kaccāyana was published in the Thai Script, bearing the title Kaccāyanamūlañ Nāma Pakaraṇam. It contains Suttas, Vutti and the Dhātupātha, with a translation of the Suttas in Thai, by Phravisuddhisombodi. In 1940, S. M. Katre published his study of the Pali Dhātupāthas in the Bulletin of the Deccan College Post Graduate Research Institute, Pune. In the same year, Bhikshu Jagadish Kashyap wrote Pāli-Mahāvyākaraṇa, a lucid explanation of the rules of the Pali grammar on the basis of the Moggallāna Vyākaraṇa. In 1957, L. Renou published an article comparing the Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa with the Kātantra Vyākaraṇa. In 1962, Visuddhācara published a Burmese commentary on the Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa entitled Kaccāyana-Suttattha. In the same year, L. N. Tiwari and Birbal Sharma published Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa with a Hindi translation. This book is extremely useful for the study of the Kacc, because of its scholarly annotations and appendices comparing the rules of the Kacc with that of the Kātantra and the Aṣtādhyāyī. In 1967, A. K. Warder translated two short passages pertaining to metrical problems. ${ }^{1}$ In 1971, Y. Ojihara, with a 'note préliminaire' by C. Calliat, compared a chapter of the Saddamiti (kibbidhānakappu, pariccheda 26) with 'données pāṇinéennes'. ${ }^{2}$ In 1977, a Thai scholar studied the finite verb system in the Kacc for his M. A. dissertation. In 1979, another Thai scholar Bunyamalik Tongpoon worked on the sandhi and the samāsa of the Kacc, which was published by the Chulalongkom University, Bangkok. In 1988, Phramaha Somjai translated the

Padarūpasiddhi in Thai. In 1989, Chamnanrua Bamroong published a study of the primary derivatives in the Saddanitipakaranam. This was followed by a study of the secondary derivatives in the Rūpasiddhi by Chaisuwan Prachok in 1990.

In 1991, Tin Lwin wrote an article giving a brief, general introduction on the Saddaniti, including its date and authorship. In 1992, E. Kahrs published a monograph on the Saddanīti's Kārakakappa (A section dealing with syntax) 'Exploring the Saddanīti'. Here he makes a detailed analysis and comparison with other works on Sanskrit and Pali grammar and tries to trace its sources. Recently, from 1989 onwards, O. H. Pind has published some articles on the history and the development of the indigenous Pali philology. The first among them is 'Studies in the Pali Grammarians, I'. In this article, he studied the grammatical analysis found in Buddhaghosa's works and tried to find their sources. According to him, "whenever Buddhaghosa refers to grammar or grammarians in support of his analysis of a grammatical or semantical problem in the Pāli, he is referring to Pāninian grammar" (Pind 1990:175). This was followed by another article 'Studies in the Pali Grammarians, II.1' in the year 1990. In this article Pind deals with some more cases of Buddhaghosa's syntactic analysis found in the Samantapāsādikā and the Paramattha-jotikā. In the same article, he also studies the grammatical analysis found in Mahānāma's commentary on the Paṭisambhidāmagga and Buddhadatta's commentary on the Buddhavamisa to show that the nature of the grammatical references that occur in the post-Buddhaghosa Pāli Atṭhakathās reflect a wider variety of sources and influences than in the case of Buddhaghosa's grammatical comments (Pind 1990:177). In 1995, in an article entitled 'Pali Grammarians: The Methodology of the Pali Grammarians', Pind studies a couple of examples of the methodology of the Pali grammarians to show the tendency among Pāli grammarians to refer to the canon or the atṭhakathās when discussing phonological, morphological, or syntactical problems of the Pāli. Responding to H. Smith's claim that the indigenous Pali
grammars of the $12^{\text {th }}-13^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. are likely to have exerted a considerable influence on the contemporary Theravāda scribes, Pind concludes saying that "there is no proof that the grammatical literature has had any influence on Theravāda scribes: in spite of major divergences, Pāli literature is remarkably consistent, as shown by the many canonical quotations in the grammatical literature" (Pind 1995: 297). In another article 'Pali Grammar and Grammarians From Buddhaghosa to Vajirabuddhi', written in 1997 Pind takes the historical review of the development of indigenous Pali philology from Buddhaghosa up to Vajirabuddhi. All these articles are very important as they shed considerable light on the development of the Pali grammatical tradition. In 1997, Phramaha Thiab Malai completed a doctoral dissertation entitled 'Kaccāyana - Vyākaraṇa: A Critical Study' submitted to the University of Pune providing an annotated translation of the Kacc.

These modern studies of indigenous Pali grammars are undoubtedly indebted to the publication of a number of editions of principal Pali grammars and their sub-commentaries in various scripts. Among them, the mention should be made of following important editions:

From the above description, it is quite evident that barring the researches of L. Renou and E. Kahrs, there is hardly any attempt to make a detailed comparison of the Pali grammatical treatises with their Sanskrit counterparts.

The present attempt to study the technical terminology and the technique of the Pali grammarians from the comparative point of view is an initial step in this direction. It is a part of a broader comparative study of the Pali and the Sanskrit grammatical treatises. The work is divided into three chapters. Chapter One presents a brief historical sketch of the Pali grammatical tradition and introduces three Pali grammars viz. the Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, the Saddamīti and the Moggallāna Vyākaraṇa along with the three Sanskrit grammars viz. the Aṣtādhyāyī (Aṣ̣), the Kātantra Vyākaraṇa ( Kt ) and the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa (CV). Chapter two
deals with the technical terminology used by the Pali grammarians. In all 166 technical terms are classified into eight sub-sections according to the different linguistic categories such as: the phonetic terminology, the terminology related to the morphophonemic changes, the morphological terminology, the terminology denoting the parts of speech, the terminology denoting syntactic relations, the terminology denoting complex formations, the terminology denoting various grammatical concepts and the miscellaneous terms. Each term is explained according to its definition and usage. It is then compared with its Sanskrit counterpart in the Aṣt, the Kt and the CV. An attempt is also made to trace its origin and development in the Sanskrit tradition. Chapter three compares the overall technique and different technical devices used by the Pali and the Sanskrit grammarians. Chapter four records some observations drawn from the data presented in the foregoing chapters. The present investigation has its own limitations as it is confined only to the study of the technical terminology and technique. Some observations made at this stage may not be conclusive for want of further investigation. However, I hope that the information, explanations, conclusions and errors of this work will motivate further study in this rather unexplored field.


# Chapter One 

## Introduction

## 1. A Brief Historical Sketch of the Pali Grammatical Tradition

The origin of the Pali philology can be traced back to the time of the Atṭhakathās (the Pali commentaries on the Tipiṭaka). The Pali Atṭhakathās of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapāla and Buddhadatta contain occasional discussions on a syntactical problem, ${ }^{1}$ a particular construction ${ }^{2}$ or the derivation of a particular word ${ }^{3}$ or the like. It is possible to show that in substance these discussions presuppose the Pāṇinian grammar. The main feature of this type of discussions is that they identify syntactical or other features of Pali with similar features of Sanskrit (Sakkaṭabhāsā) described by P in his Ast. This in turn rules out the possibility of the existence of any pre-Buddhaghosa Pali grammars, as is believed by scholars like Franke and others. It is, however, surprising that many of these important observations made in the Atṭhakathās did not receive due recognition in the early grammatical literature. Later when the grammatical tradition developed, some of these analyses were absorbed in the treatises of Mogg and Agg, for instance, Buddhaghosa's analysis of the syntactical constraints on the tense of the verb when constructed with the sentence complements atthi nāma, ${ }^{4}$ kathaṃ hi nāma ${ }^{5}$ and yatra hi nāma ${ }^{6}$ is incorporated by

Mogg and Agg at MV $6.3^{t}$ and Sadd $893^{2}$ respectively. Similarly, Buddhaghosa's analysis at Vism 216, 4ff of the series of words ending in -ika occurring in a sentence svākkhāto Bhagavatā dhammo sanditṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccattam veditabbo viññūhī ti was also incorporated by Mogg and Agg at MVu 4.29 and Sadd 764 respectively. But there are still many interesting observations, which did not receive a place in these Pali grammars. These occasional grammatical discussions found in the Aṭthakathās mark the initial phase of the Pali philology.

The second phase is marked by the emergence of the indigenous Pali grammatical literature. It begins with the compilation of K's grammar ( $6^{\text {th }}$ to $7^{\text {th }}$ century A.D.). The subsequent grammarians tried to improve upon the Kacc by formulating new rules, or reformulating the rules embodied in the Kacc or the Kacc-Vu, so as to improve upon their grammatical description of many phonological, morphological and syntactical features. This was done on the basis of a comprehensive collection of examples from the canonical and the post-canonical literature. There are a number of post-Kaccāyana treatises such as the Mahānir, the Cūl-nir and its commentary the Mañj, the Nir-pṭ, the Sangaha, the Mahāsandhippakaraṇa and the Cūḷasandhi, which are no longer extant but are occasionally referred to in works such as Vajirabuddhi's Mmd, Buddhapiya's Rūp, the MV, the Mogg-p, and the Sadd. It appears that these treatises though lost, had a great impact on the subsequent Pali grammarians. For instance,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 nāme garahāviṃhayesu '(The future occurs) in construction with the particle nāma to express reproach or wonder'. Mogg's explanation here goes against the stand taken by Buddhaghosa. Mogg-p criticizes this view saying that it is only the presence of the particle nāma as such that entails future. Agg in turn criticizes Mogg and defends Buddhaghosa saying that it can be shown that nāma in itself has no restrictive force on the tense of the verb.
    2 kathañhināmayogenātīte'nāgatasseva payogo 'In construction with the sentence complement the future form of the verb alone is used to convey the sense of the past'.
Patañjali's Mañj, a text, which was written in the form of kārikās and modeled after Bhartṛhari's Vākya has influenced the description of the kāraka system in the Rūp and the Sadd.

This process of evolution reached its peak in the second half of the $12^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. with the compositions of the MV of Mogg and the Sadd of Agg. What followed thereafter was a creation of a number of commentaries and sub-commentaries modeled on these three texts. The Kacc-nidd - no doubt the most important source of information on the grammatical literature in the $13^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. quotes as many as 24 grammatical treatises ${ }^{1}$ in addition to the wellknown works like the Mmd, the Rūp, the Sadd and the MV. Out of these, the Atthavyākhyāna of Cūḷavajira and the Mukhamattasāra of Guṇasāgara are also mentioned in the Gv. The latest in this series is the Vācakopadesa, which is composed in the first part of the $17^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. We have provided a list of eighty-two known grammatical works in the appendices one to four.

Thus, it is a constantly developing tradition spread over a thousand years. Some of the salient features of this tradition are:

1. It presents itself as a complete and an independent grammatical system having its own set of ancillary texts such as dhātupātha, gaṇapāṭha and ṇvādivṛtti.
2. The Pali grammars follow the basic structure of the Sanskrit grammar and draw heavily upon them in the matter of technique, technical terminology, grammatical concepts and the manner of description. However, their merit lies in the fact that they are written in the light of the canonical and the post-canonical literature and there is a

growing tendency of relating themselves with the existing usage.
3. Unlike the grammars of the Prakrit languages, these grammars deny the historical relation between Pali and Sanskrit and try to depict Pali as a language independent of Sanskrit. Note that the Prakrit grammars such as Vararuci's Prākrtaprakāśa describe the Prakrit languages in the context of Sanskrit with a view that they evolved out of Sanskrit. One obvious drawback of this denial is that the Pali grammarians failed to explain some grammatical phenomena, which were a result of that relation. For instance, they could not explain why the initial syllable of some verbal roots is duplicated when they are preceded by a vowel, e.g., niggaho, paggaho etc. The well-known reason for this phenomenon is that the underlying Sanskrit roots begin with a cluster viz. $n i+g r a h$ and $p r a+g r a h$.

# Aim and Purpose of the Pali Grammars 

It is quite well known that the grammar held a prestigious position among all the ancient Indian sciences. It is considered to be one of the Vedāngas (auxiliary sciences of the Veda). Grammar also has the similar status in the Buddhist tradition. According to the Dhammapada (24.19):
vītataṇho anādāno niruttipadakovido /
akkharānaṃ sannipātaṃ jaññā pubbaparāni ca /
sa ve antimasārīro mahāpañño ti vuccati //1
According to the Pali grammarians, the main aim of the Pali grammar is to understand the exact meaning of the Buddha's

[^0]
[^0]:    1 'He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the words and their interpretation, who knows the order of letters (those which are before and which are after), he has received his last body, he is called the great sage, the great man'.
teaching, which is the true path of salvation. ${ }^{1}$ Later in the tradition, Dhammasenāpati in his Kārikās explains the purpose of learning grammar as:
saddānusāsanassa kim payojanam ti ce vade /
rakkhohāgamalahūpāyāsandehatthameva ca // ${ }^{2}$
This clearly follows the pattern of the Mbh:
rakṣohāgamalaghvasandehāh prayojanam (Mbh I.1)
However, the pedagogic model accepted by K suggests that the emergence of the indigenous Pali grammar was probably prompted by the need to prepare a textbook for the study of Pali in monasteries. This assumption is supported by the following facts:

1. The Kacc and the Kacc-Vu are not composed in the tradition of the Atṭthakathās. ${ }^{3}$
2. The Kacc mainly describes the broad features of the language.
3. The Kacc follows the graphic practice of writing for the description of sandhi, which is well suited for teaching.

The Pali grammarians' urge for identity migit be another reason behind this entire activity of producing an indigenous Pali grammar.

    2 'If one asks what is the purpose of the science of grammar, then (it should be answered), that it is for the sake of protection (of the Canon), comprehension, canonical injunctions, easy means, and clear understanding'.
    3 As said before, most of the grammatical analysis found in the Atṭhakathās is not noticed by the compilers of this grammar. On a number of occasions, the explanation found in Kacc contradicts the explanation given in the Atṭhakathās. Cf. Kacc 20 and Agg's comment on the phrase ekamidāham at Sadd 50 (p. 617).
After this brief sketch of the Pali grammatical tradition, we shall now proceed to take a brief survey of the three important grammars of Pali viz. the Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, the Saddamīti and the Moggallānavyākaraṇa. It will be followed by a brief survey of the three important grammars of Sanskrit, viz. the Aṣtādhyāyī, the Kātantra Vyākaraṇa and the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa, which have exerted a great deal of influence on the composition of the Pali grammars.
# Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa and Its Author 

The history of the Pali grammar begins with the compilation of Kaccāyana 's grammar ( $6^{\text {th }}$ to $7^{\text {th }}$ century A.D.). The grammar in its present form consists of the grammatical aphorisms (suttas), the commentary (vutti), examples and counterexamples (payoga) and the detailed analysis of the above (nyāsa). The tradition believes that the suttas were composed by K, the Vutti by Saṅghanandin, Payoga by Brahmadatta and Nyāsa by Vimalabuddhi / Vajirabuddhi:

Kaccānena kato yogo vutti ca Saṅghanandinā / payogo Brahmadattena nyāso Vimalabuddhinā //
According to the Sinhalese tradition, the grammar was composed by the Buddha's disciple Mahākaccāyana. This tradition goes back to the Apadāna Atṭhakathā (A I 23,16-28) where it is mentioned that Mahākaccāyana expounded the three treatises Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, Mahāniruttippakaraṇa and Nettippakaraṇa in the middle of the Sangha. K's commentators such as Vajirabuddhi and Chapaṭ also seem to take this for granted. This was also accepted in later works such as the Kacc-Vṇ and the Kacc-nidd. On the question of authorship, Vajirabuddhi (Mmd p. 6) says:
kattā nāma etadaggam, bhikkhave, mama sāvakānam bhikkhūnaṃ saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena attham vibhajantānam, yadidam Mahākaccāyano'ti bhagavatā etadagge ṭhapito āyasmā mahākaccāyano! ${ }^{1}$
Chapaṭa associates the grammar with the legendary tale that the first rule of the Kacc: attho akkharasañ̃āato, ${ }^{2}$ was uttered by the Buddha after hearing a monk mispronouncing udayabbayam as udakabakam. The same view is also held by the author of the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "The author is the venerable Mahākaccāyana who was placed in the forefront by the Blessed One, saying 'this one is the best among my monk disciples who can analyze in detail whatever is said in brief, i.e. Mahākaccāyana'".
    2 "The meaning is expressed through the syllables".
Kacc-Vn. ${ }^{1}$ The mythical nature of this account is itself an indication of the uncertain origin and authorship of the Kacc.

James Elvis stands alone among the modern scholars, who has accepted and defended the traditional view about the authorship of the Kacc. This view is already refuted by scholars like Windisch, L. N. Tiwari and O. H. Pind. O. H. Pind (1997:35) does not approve of a single author. In his view, the Kacc is a compilation by various hands.

# Date 

As in the case of the authorship, nothing can be said with certainty about the date of the Kacc. According to James Elwis, who holds that the Kacc is a work of Mahākaccāyana, the grammar was composed as early as the $6^{\text {th }}$ century B.C. According to Satīśacandra Vidyābhūṣaṇa (1901: Preface, p. 27) who identifies K with Vararuci, it was composed in 250 B.C. As said earlier, these views are no longer valid. Scholars like Windisch (Geiger 1968:37, fn 6), Geiger (1968:37), L. N. Tiwari (1962:65 ff ) and others place it in the wide span from $4^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. $-11^{\text {th }}$ c. A.D. i.e., after Buddhaghosa and before Vajirabuddhi. ${ }^{2}$ Recently, O. H. Pind (1997:34) has suggested that the most likely date of the composition of the Kacc is $6^{\text {th }}-7^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. His arguments behind this claim are:

1. Kacc's rule 69: ādito ca o, ${ }^{3}$ explains the form ādo, which is a Sanskritism and a feature of the post-Buddhaghosa Pali.
[^0]
[^0]:    1 idaṃ suttam kena vuttam? Bhagavatā vuttam ... tadā bhagavā obhāsam muñcitvā 'attho akkharasaññāto' ti vākyam ṭhapeti, tesaṃ ca kammaṭhānam patiṭthati, tasmā bhagavatā vuttam ti vuccati / taṃ ñatvā, mahākaccāyano bhagavantaṃ yācitvā, himavantaṃ gantvā, manosilātale dakkhiṇadisābhāgaṃ sīsaṃ katvā, puratthimadisābhimukho hutvā, 'attho akkharasaññāto'tyādikaṃ kaccāyanappakaraṇaṃ viraci (Kacc-Vṇ on Kacc 1).

    2 Note that L. N. Tiwari places Mmd in $11^{\text {th }}$ c. A.D.
    3 It teaches the substitution of the locative morpheme smim coming after $\bar{a} d i$ by $o$.
Therefore, this rule must have been composed at a time when this Sanskritism, which is recorded in the Vin-vṇ had been well established, presumably in the $6^{\text {th }}-7^{\text {th }} \mathrm{c}$. A.D.
2. The upper limit cannot be stretched beyond $8^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. because in that case, there would not be sufficient time for the comprehensive commentarial literature viz. the Kacc-Vu, the Mahā-nir, the Sudatta-nir, the Nir-pit, the Cul-nir and the Mañj to develop between the $8^{\text {th }}$ and the $10^{\text {th }}-11^{\text {th }}$ century A.D., which is the relative date of the Mmd.
3. Since the Kacc-Vu sometimes misinterprets the Kacc (Kacc-Vu 341), it is reasonable to assume that it was composed at a time when the purport of certain rules was no longer clearly understood. Moreover, the Kacc-Vu presupposes the Kāśikā and thus presumably belongs to the $8^{\text {th }}$ century A.D.

Since K's grammar is not written in the tradition of the Atṭhakathās and the fact that apart from the technical terminology, it also ignores a large number of important grammatical discussions found in the Atṭhakathās, we strongly feel that the major part of K's grammar was composed little after the time of Buddhaghosa. Kacc 69, which teaches an isolated Sanskritism ( $\bar{a} d o$ ), is the sole ground for Pind's arguments about fixing the lower limit of K's grammar ( $6^{\text {th }}$ century). However, since Pind himself considers the Kacc to be a compilation at various hands, it can well be treated as a late addition. About the term niggahīta, which basically refers to the tendency of nasalization, which is common to both the Atṭhakathās and K's grammar, it can be said that it comes from some common source. Thus, though the date of the Kacc as proposed by Pind is generally acceptable, its reliability can still be questioned.
# Title 

According to the opening verse of the Kacc, the grammar is called Susandhikappa ${ }^{1}$ or Sandhikappa. Thus, the title of the first chapter is transferred to the grammar as a whole. This is also confirmed by the fact that the phrase sandhikappo nitthito is found at the end of mss. However, the tradition in general refers to the grammar by the name of Kaccāyana. ${ }^{2}$ Besides this, two other titles Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, ${ }^{3}$ and Kaccāyanagandha ${ }^{4}$ are also current in the tradition.

## Composition

The text of the Kacc, as it is now available to us, is comprised of four parts and 23 sections ${ }^{5}$ : Sandhikappa (Five kandas), Nāmakappa (Eight kandas), $\bar{A} k h y a ̄ t a k a p p a$ (Four kandas) and

Kibbidhānakappa (Six kandas). However, according to the traditional classification presented in the Kārikā of Dhammasenāpati, it is divided into eight chapters:
sandhināmañ ca kārakam, samāsataddhitākhyātakitakañ ca unā̄dikam /1
Thus, as per this classification, the second part Nāmakappa contains five sections and three sub-chapters and the fourth part contains five sections and one sub-chapter.

Except the second Nāmakappa, each of the four kappas of Kacc open with an introductory verse. Out of these, Mmd and Rūp only know the verses in the first and the fourth chapter indicating that the verses at the beginning of the third $\bar{A} k h y \bar{a} t a k a p p a$ were added later. ${ }^{2}$ Besides this, out of four, only the third kappa ends with a concluding verse.

There is no agreement about the exact number of rules in Kacc. According to Vajirabuddhi, the number of rules is $710 .{ }^{3} \mathrm{He}$, however, comments on 708 rules, of which he considers 34 to be interpolations. Thus in the view of Mmd, only 674 suttas are genuine. According to an account provided by Dhammasenāpati, there are 51 rules in the Sandhi chapter, 218 in the Nāma chapter, 35 in the Kāraka chapter, 28 in the Samāsa chapter, 62 in the Taddhita chapter, 118 in the $\bar{A} k h y a ̄ t a$ chapter, 100 in the Kit chapter and 50 in the Unādi chapter. ${ }^{4}$ Thus, the total number of

rules is 672 . The Kacc-Vn, which was probably written in the $16^{\text {th }}$ century A. D. gives the number of rules as 675 . The Sinhalese and Siamese versions of the Kacc also follow the same number whereas the Burmese version has 673 rules omitting Kacc 244245 .

# Sources, Nature and Scope 

It is a well-established fact that Kacc is modeled after the Kt . As shown by L. N. Tiwari (1962:443-447), approximately 215 rules of Kt are reproduced at the Kacc with the necessary alterations. He also has shown that there are approximately 300 rules in Kacc, which can be taken as the edited versions of P's rules (1962:448-451). R. O. Franke has shown that many of the Kacc's rules from the Kāraka section presuppose the Aṣt and even the Kāsikā. This shows that the compiler(s) of the Kacc tried to amalgamate the Kt and the Aṣt. However, the Kacc has generally followed the Kt in the matter of the subject-wise arrangement of the text, the descriptive technique of rule formation, absence of pratyāhāras, and adherence to the older technical terms. According to O. H. Pind (1997:47), although K has borrowed a couple of its case designations from the Atṭhakathās, there is no clear indication that the work as such is written in the tradition of the Atṭhakathās. On the contrary, it seems to have been written more or less independently of the commentarial literature. In spite of this drawback, this small text containing 675 rules is still remarkable in itself as it treats large number of the linguistic features of Pali. However, that does not mean that its treatment of the language is exhaustive and precise.

According to Kacc 52, the scope of the K's grammar is limited to the Jinavacana $\delta$ The words of the conquerorō. This does not mean that the Kacc only deals with the language spoken by the Buddha. The language it describes includes the entire Pali Tipitaka, together with the Atṭhakathās. Apart from this, it also
incorporates a number of Sanskritisms such as $\bar{a} d o,{ }^{1}$ Prakritisms such as gheppati, ${ }^{2}$ coddasa ${ }^{3}$ and sometimes the forms, which are not instantiated in the literature such as puthag eva ${ }^{4}$ and aggini. ${ }^{5}$

# Saddanīti 

## Introduction

Sadd in many ways constitutes the culmination of centuries of the indigenous Pali philology. On account of its extensive treatment of the language, it has become the most admired Pali grammar in the scholastic community. A. K. Warder (1963:383) calls it "the finest and most comprehensive grammar, and standard authority on all questions of grammatical analysis".

According to B. C. Law (1933:636, note 1), it is no doubt a standard work on the Pali grammar and philology. K. R. Norman (1983:164) says:
"The greatest of extant Pali grammars is the Saddanīti".

## Author and date

The colophon of the text tells us that it is a work of a Burmese monk named Aggavamsa who was the resident of Arimaddanapura. ${ }^{1}$ Forchhammer mentions him among the famous residents in the retired monastery on the northern plateau above Pagan, 'the cradle of Pali-Burmese literature'. He is said to be the teacher of the King Narapati Sithu (A.D. 1167-1202). ${ }^{2}$ According to M. H. Bode (1909:16):
"During the reigns of Anorata's immediate successors learning took firm root at Pagan, and in the year 1154 the monk Aggavamsa completed the Saddanīti, a grammar of the Tipitaka, described as

[^0]
[^0]:    1 iti Samantabhaddassa mahāAggapanditassa santike gahitupajihena tamsissassa Samantabhaddassa Aggapanditassa bhāgineyyena patiladdhataṃnāmadheyyena susampadāyena karanasampattijanitaniravajjavacanena Arimaddanapuravāsinā Aggavamsācariyena kataṃ Saddanītippakaraṇam niṭthitam!
    2 M. H. Bode (1909:16).
'the most comprehensive in existence'. It established the reputation of Burmese scholarship in that age and the fame of the autthro to the present day, for the Saddamiti is still republished in Burma as a classic."
Bode (1909:17) also claims that the work was taken to Ceylon by a Burmese monk Uttarājīva, where it was well received and admired by the scholars. E. Kahrs (1992: fn. 2, p.2) tells us:
"In an article 'The Saddamiti' Tin Lwin has questioned this date, claiming that 'nowhere in the Saddanīti is given its date' and that the introductory gäthās are missing in all the MSS available to us. He concludes, somewhat confusingly, that the Sadd 'should be placed towards the end of the reign of Cāṃsu II (1173-1210) or during the first half of the thirteenth century'".
Thus, no finality is yet reached on the exact year of Sadd's composition.

# Composition 

Agg's Sadd is a voluminous work comprising three parts and twenty-eight chapters called kappas. The first 19 chapters are called Mahāsaddanīti, and the last nine Cullasaddanīti. The first part Padamālā "A garland of words", which consists of 14 chapters, is a type of an elaborate commentary on bhū sattāyām, the opening entry of a Pāṇinīya Dhātupāṭha. The Padamālā (1-14) gives a complete morphology of Pāli, interspersed with nayas from the Buddhavacana, and criticisms of the precepts of Kaccāyana and various Sanskritisms found in Pāli from the works of Buddhaghosa down to the Mahābodhivamisa. ${ }^{1}$ The second, the Dhātumālā "A garland of verbal roots", which consists of 5 chapters, is a dhātupātha in eight ganas with meaning entries and a commentary with examples of derivatives allegedly attested in the Canon and

[^0]

supported by the lexicographical kārikās. The third part called Suttamālā "A garland of rules" contains nine chapters. Out of these, the first seven chapters, which are similar to the Sūtrapātha of the Sanskrit grammarians, contain 1347 short rules with a commentary "Vutti". These seven chapters are followed by two important chapters: one on the four parts of speech (Vācogadhapadavibhatti) and another on the fourfold nayas concerning the Canon (Pāli), the commentaries (Atṭhakathās), the sub-commentaries (Tīkās) and other exegetical works (Pakaraṇas). Every chapter of Sadd opens up with an introductory verse and ends with a concluding statement.

# Sources 

Agg's Sadd is an attempt to integrate the results of centuries of the indigenous grammar and examine them in the light of the canonical and the post-canonical Pali. As said before, Sadd is mainly based on the writings of the ācariyas as well as on canonical material. ${ }^{1}$ It is largely indebted to the Kacc and the Kacc-Vu. Most of the amendments suggested in Kacc-Vu are incorporated in Sadd in the form of separate rules. Besides, it also uses material from Mahā-nir, ${ }^{2}$ Cul-nir, ${ }^{3}$ Nir-pṭ, ${ }^{4}$ Mañj, ${ }^{5}$ Mmd, and

Rūp. Other than these Pali sources, Sadd also appears to draw upon Sanskrit sources such as Kt and its commentaries DV, and DT; Aṣṭ, Mbh, Vākya, and Kāśikā.

# Nature and Scope 

The Sadd is an elaborate, comprehensive and improved version of the Kacc. It considers almost all the rules of the Kacc and tries to amend them in order to redefine their scope in the light of the canonical usage and their explanations found in the Atṭhakathās. ${ }^{1}$ On occasions, the rules are modified in order to achieve the clarity of expression, and to facilitate the pronunciation. ${ }^{2}$ It incorporates comments from the Kacc's commentaries such as the Kacc-Vu, the Mmd, the Rūp, the Nir-pit, the Cul-nir etc. It also includes the views that are not approved by Agg with the expression matantare (Sadd 231). Apart from this, there are rules suggesting optional derivation of a particular word. These types of optional derivations are generally suggested with the word athavā (Sadd 381).

The work in its present form consists of rules followed by an auto commentary, which has made the text more special. However, those rules, which are composed in the commentarial style and are capable of conveying the meaning on their own are given without the commentary. ${ }^{3}$ Each rule is furnished with a number of examples and counterexamples. Besides this, the text is full of associative digressions discussing important textual issues. ${ }^{4}$ Important topics are generally introduced with an introduction, which prepares a ground for further discussion. ${ }^{5}$

    4 Cf. for example, Agg's discussion on the three types of peyālam under Sadd 508 .
    5 Cf. excursus at the beginning of the taddhita section (p. 782-783).
The Sadd is a grammar, which was written in the tradition of the Aṭthakathās. There are occasions where Agg has refuted statements from the Kacc and the Kacc-Vu and of some anonymous teachers on the ground that they go against the canonical usage or the explanation found in the Aṭthakathās (Sadd 41, 48). Agg stands alone among the Pali grammarians in treating the linguistic phenomena that are peculiar to a particular form of literature such as gāthā, pāvacana etc. (Sadd 70, 134, 156, 160) and different stages in the development of Pali such as canonical and post-canonical (Sadd 674, 889). Note that P has also treated the peculiarities of the Vedic as well as the classical Sanskrit. He has also taken a note of the linguistic peculiarities found in the various Vedas such as yajumṣi, sāma etc. Apart from this, he has also dealt with the regional variants.

Though the Sadd is praised for its detailed description of the Pali language, it is not free from all sorts of blemishes. In our view, its major drawback is its bulky nature caused by unnecessary repetitions and secondly by lack of consistency in the information provided in the Suttamālā and the other two books, e.g., the explanation of the term vibhatti and the enumeration of kārakas. Cf. discussion of these words at Chapter 2, Section 4: Vibhatti and Section 6: Kāraka. Though Agg is strongly against the tendency of Sanskritaization, ${ }^{1}$ on occasions he has formulated rules explaining some well-established Sanskritisms such as ādo (Sadd 218). Just as Kacc, Sadd has also incorporated some unwarranted Prakritisms such as coddasa (Sadd 826) and gheppati (Sadd 931). Apart from this, it also incorporates forms that are not instantiated such as puthag eva (Sadd 53). Sadd 731: jāyāya kvaci tudamjāni patimhi, is a typical case. It repeats Kacc-Vu's mistake of misinterpreting Kacc 341 giving rise to a ghost-form tudampati. In his study on Sadd's Kārakakappa, E. Kahrs has shown that on a number of

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Sadd 794: keci pana sakkaṭabhāsato nayaṃ gahetvā candamā ti paṭhanti, tam na yuttam/
occasions Agg has tried to thrust the pattern of the Sanskrit grammar on Pali. In spite of these drawbacks, the Sadd still holds the merit of being the most comprehensive and the informative grammar of Pali.

It is, however, very surprising that in spite of being such an important treatise, the Sadd has no commentarial tradition of its own. We know of only one translation type commentary, a Burmese Nissaya, which translates the Pali text while adding additional information in Burmese.

The arrangement of the text is such that lots of information is repeated which has made the work very bulky. For the present study, we have focused mainly on the third part, as it is more technical and traditional in its presentation.

2. He merges sections dealing with the primary derivatives and the $n v \bar{a} d i$ suffixes together in one chapter.
# Moggallānavyākaraṇa 

Author and Date

Moggallānavyākaraṇa or Māgadham Saddalakkhanam is the most systematic and technically sound grammar of Pali. It is a complete system with the indigenous suttapātha, dhātupātha, ganapātha and nvādipātha. Besides this, the text has two auto commentaries the MVu and the Mogg-p. Though this is the generally accepted view, the MVu's statement: vhopanante niddes $\bar{a}$ tvādisambandhiyeva tasseva vā nissitattā nissayakaranampi hī suttakārācinnam (MVu 6.38) raises some doubt about their common authorship. The grammar was originated in Ceylon. This influential grammar was composed by a Sinhelese monk called Moggallāna or Moggalāyana from the Thūpārāma monastery of Anurādhapura in the reign of King Parakkamabāhu (A. D. 11531186). G. P. Malalasekera (1928:186) informs us:
"He was a pupil of Mahā-Kassapa of Udumbaragiri, and it is stated in the colophon of the grammar that he wrote it in the reign of Parākramabāhu the Great, after the king had purged the Sangha of all heretical and sinful Bhikkhus, i.e. after A.D. 1165".
Malalasekera further identifies him with the Moggallāna Thera mentioned in the Tamil inscription of Vijaya-Bāhu, as having been entrusted with the custodianship of the Tooth-relic and concludes that he was the head of the Uttaramūla Nikāya. He was a distinguished scholar highly respected by his contemporary scholars such as Medhanikara, the author of several important works, and by Sangharakkhita, the author of many works on Pali grammar and prosody. Both of them were disciples of Sāriputta. As Norman (1963:165) remarks:
"Moggallāna deals with the linguistic material more exhaustively and with greater understanding of the essence and character of Pāli, which with the influx of both Sanskrit and Sinhalese influence had
changed somewhat since the earlier grammarians had written their works".

# Composition 

Mogg's Māgadham saddalakkhanam "a grammar of the Māgadha language" is comprised of six chapters called kandas and 810 rules with the commentary "Vutti". The text is arranged systematically according to the topics.

## Sources

According to Malalasekera (1958:179), "Moggallāna's work was an attempt to start a new school of Pāli grammar in Ceylon". Many of its aphorisms are presented differently than that of the Kacc. There are a number of occasions where Mogg shows a difference of opinion from K. Cf. MV 1.1, 1.32. Another point of difference is the use of the grammatical terminology. According to O. H. Pind (1995:283), though the MV is different from the Kacc in style, it does not institute an actual break from K's tradition, as it is also largely indebted to K and post-Kaccāyana grammarians. For instance, MVu 2.52 refers to Cul-nir, and MVu 2.46 and 3.19 refer to Nir-pt. On occasions, MV also incorporates the grammatical discussions found in the Aṭthakathās. Cf. MV 6.3. Apart from this, his grammar is largely influenced by CV and CVṛ. The influence of Kt and its commentaries, DV and DT, is also visible in the Samjin $\bar{a}$ section of his grammar.

## Scope and Nature

In the opening verse of his grammar, Mogg claims that he is going to compose a grammar of the Māgadha language. ${ }^{1}$ It seems that there has been a tradition to refer to the Buddha's language as

[^0]
[^0]:    1 siddhamiddha guṇam sādhu namassitvā tathāgatam/ sadhammasaṅgham bhāsissam māgadham saddalakkhanam //
Māgadha along with Māgadhī. O. H. Pind informs us that Śri Rāhūla in the Padasādhanaṭikā quotes two verses from the Nirvann stating that Jina has not propounded the Dhamma except in Māgadha. Agg also talks of Māgadha bhāsā: ... māgadhabhāsattam pana patvā candarābhā ti visuṃ tiṭthati (Sadd 532).

As said before, MV is the most systematic Pali grammar. It follows the topic-wise arrangement. This type of arrangement can be observed in the overall structure of the text as well as within each chapter. In the case of rule formations, Mogg adopts the compact sūtra style of P and C instead of the descriptive style of the Kacc and the Kt. On a number of occasions, he has clubbed two or more rules of the Kacc into one. Cf. MV 1.30: yavā sare which takes care of Kacc 18: vamodudantānam and Kacc 21: ivanno yanna vā. This has helped him in achieving brevity. In order to maintain the clarity of expression, Mogg generally avoids the use of technical terms with the exception of some basic terms such as sara, vyañjana, rassa, dīgha etc. In order to achieve economy and precision of expression, Mogg has skillfully used a number of technical devices such as the principle of anuvrtti (Ellipsis) and indicatory letters. Besides this, he has also adopted a number of paribhāsās "operational rules" that are used in the grammars of P and C .

Although the MV surpasses the other two grammars in the matter of scientific handling of the data, its description of Pali is sometimes incorrect. It treats many Sanskritisms that are rejected in Sadd. Cf. Sadd 40, 45. Following Kacc, it has also incorporated a number of Prakritisms (gheppati - MV 5.178, coddasa - MV 3.100).

Alteration made by Moggallāna with reference to the Kaccāyana

1. All the technical terms defined by Mogg are given at the beginning of the first chapter. Note that in the Kacc and the Sadd, the technical terms denoting the four classes of nominals and the vocative singular suffix si are given at the beginning of the section on the nominal inflection.
2. Mogg refrains from defining various kāraka categories. He has simply merged the kāraka section of the Kacc with a section dealing with the allocation of cases and shifted it before a section on the nominal inflection.
3. The categories of kammappavacanīyas and gatis, which are discussed by K in the section dealing with particles, are treated separately by Mogg in their relevant context. For instance, kammappavacanīyas are discussed under the section dealing with syntax whereas gatis are discussed in the compound section in the context of the gatisamāsa.
4. The feminine suffixes and morphology related to the compounds of numerals are treated in the compound section.
5. Suffixes to etc., which convey the sense of case endings and morphology related to the taddhita derivations, is given in the taddhita section.
6. A section dealing with the primary derivatives is shifted before a section on the verbal inflection.
7. Suffixes instrumental in deriving the derivative verbal roots and vikaranas are shifted at the beginning of the chapter dealing with the primary derivatives.
# Aṣtādhyāyī 

## Introduction

Pāṇini's Aṣtādhyāyī is a monumental work of the Sanskrit grammar. Due to its accuracy, thoroughness of the treatment and superiority of technique, it has excelled all its predecessors, and has dominated the thoughts of generations of thinkers even to the present times. It is the oldest surviving specimen of treatises on the scientific or technical topics, which were composed in the form of aphorisms (sūtras).

## Date

The question of dating P is much debated by scholars. Considering their respective views, the generally accepted date for P is 500 B.C.

## Nature and Scope

Aṣtādhyāyī as its title suggests, is a collection of eight chapters (adhyāyas). Each of these eight chapters has four sub-sections, which are called pädas. Each sub-section has a number of rules, which are called sūtras. The number of rules for each chapter is not fixed. The total number of rules found in these eight chapters and the thirty-two sub-sections is 3978. This number of rules is according to the Nirnayasāgara edition of the Siddhäntakaumudī. The number of rules found in the Aṣt varies from version to version. Among the available editions of the Aṣt, the minimum number of rules found in certain editions is 3972 and the maximum number is 3980 . The Aṣtādhyāyī Sūtrapāṭha is also recited in the Vedic tradition. In this tradition, the text contains 3973 rules. According to a verse popular in the Pāninian grammatical tradition, the number is 3994:
trīni sūtrasahasrāni tathā nava śatāni ca /
caturnavati sūtrāni Pāniniḥ krtavān svayam //
It seems that this number also includes the fourteen varnasütras. Thus according to this tradition, the number of rules in the Aṣt is 3980 .

The number of rules found in each sub-section depends on the topic of that sub-section. The second sub-section of the second chapter containing 38 rules is the smallest sub-section in the Aṣt whereas the first sub-section of the sixth chapter containing 223 rules is the biggest sub-section of the Aṣt.

The text of the Aṣt is naturally divided into two sections. The first section consists of first seven chapters and the first sub-section of the eighth chapter, known as sapädasaptādhyāyī or siddhakānda. The second part consists of the last three sub-sections of the eighth chapter popularly known as tripädī or asiddhakānda.

The Pāninian grammatical tradition also classifies the Aṣt into two parts, that is to say, vidhi and vidhiśesa. The vidhi section is comprised of the chapters 3,4 and 5 whereas the vidhisesa section is comprised of the remaining five chapters. The modern scholars led by Faddegon classify the Aṣt into two parts such as the analytical and the synthetic. According to this classification, the chapters one to five of the Aṣt form the analytical part whereas the chapters six, seven and eight form the synthetic part.

P has not followed the traditional subject-wise arrangement in the composition of his text. He has sacrificed it for the sake of economy, which is the hallmark of his composition. This does not mean that P has totally discarded the subject-wise arrangement. He has followed it whenever it is not contradictory to the two
principles of anuvytt ${ }^{1}$ and vipratisedha ${ }^{2}$. These two principles govern the arrangement of P's Aṣt.

Keeping this in mind, let us now examine the general scheme of the Aṣt.

1 Rules regarding the continuation of words from one rule to the subsequent rules.
2 According to the maxim 'vipratisedhe paran kāryam' "whenever there are rules having the same sphere of application, the rule, which is latter in the sequence of Aṣt, takes precedence".

1 This is a very important principle in the P's grammar. This has divided the Aṣt into two sections: the sapädasaptädhyäyī (the first seven chapters and the first sub-section of the eighth chapter) and the tripädi (the last three subsections of the eighth chapter). According to this principle, the rules found in the tripädi are applied at the final stage of word derivation, i.e. after the application of the rules of sapädasaptädhyäyī.
# Kātantra Vyākaraṇa 

## Introduction

The Kātantra Vyākaraṇa of Sarvavarman belongs to the Aindra school of grammar. Note that it is also known by the name Kalāpa or Kaumāra. It is one of the oldest and the earliest of the post Pāninian systems of the Sanskrit grammar containing four chapters and 1401 rules.

## Author and Date

Kt as it is handed down to us is a work of grammarians from Sarva onwards. It is generally believed by scholars that Kt up to the Ākhyāta section (A chapter on the verbal derivation), which is comprised of 855 rules, is a work of Sarva. The fourth chapter Kṛtprakaraṇa is generally ascribed to Kātyāyana who is also known as Vararuci (different from the Vārttikakāra). From the present text of the Kt , it appears that the work has undergone at least two revisions.

The exact date of Sarva is subject to controversy as neither he nor his commentators threw any light on this point. They merely state that Kt was written under the patronage of king Sātavāhana. Scholars like S. K. Belvalkar (1976, 69), Harprasad Shastri, R. S. Saini and Ramasagar Mishra have placed Sātavāhana in the first century A.D. Thus, the most likely date of Sarva is the first century A.D.

## Composition

Some scholars have tried to detect the same dichotomy of P's grammar into analytical and synthetic in the text of the Kt . However, a careful study of the Kt reveals that such a classification cannot be applied to the Kt . The main reason for this is that the rules pertaining to the synthetic part of the Kt are not given at one place as in P's Astt. In the Kt , the general rules of
sandhi are given in the first chapter whereas the other morphophonemic changes, which are taught in a particular context, are given along with it. For example, rules dealing with the morphophonemic changes pertaining to the nominal inflection are given in a section dealing with the nominal inflection and morphophonemic changes pertaining to the verbal inflection are given in that section. Similarly, the rules teaching the morphophonemic changes with regard to compounds are given in the compound section.

# Sources 

As said above, the Kt is a collection of works of different scholars from Sarva onwards. It incorporates many of the P's rules and the vārttikas of Kātyāyana. Yudhiṣthira Mīmāṃsaka (1984:615) has proved Kt's indebtedness to the Kāśakrtsna grammar also. Besides this, it has also borrowed many older technical terms from the Prātiśākhyas and other older treatises.

## Purpose, Nature and Scope

The advent of the Kt marks the beginning of a new era in the field of the Sanskrit grammar as there took place a remarkable shift in the methodology with respect to the topic-wise arrangement of rules, non-use of the pratyāhāra sūtras and total omission of the rules dealing with the Vedic Sanskrit and accents. As said before, the main features of P's grammar are said to be the economy of expression and precise description. The Kt on the contrary was composed to satisfy the needs of the Sanskrit learning community, which wanted to learn grammar in the simplest possible way. As S. K. Belvalkar (1976:68) puts it "Kātantra grammar was not the creation of a school, but was rather meant to satisfy a real popular need". In order to meet this requirement, Sarva and his followers have brought about some changes in the arrangement of their treatise as well as in the structuring of the rules. In Kt , the Sandhi section is introduced first along with the necessary technical terms and the operational
rules. It is then followed by chapters on nominal declension, syntax, compounds, and primary derivatives. The second half of the text is devoted to the verbal derivation where the third chapter deals with the finite verbal forms whereas the fourth chapter deals with the primary derivatives. The rules pertaining to each section are further arranged in such a way that each section forms an independent unit. Thus, a student will have to study only one chapter or a part of it in order to learn a particular topic.

The rules of the Kt are more descriptive compared to that of P . The rules of the compound section are even written in a verse form. Kt appears to focus more on the broad features than the minor details of the language. Besides these, some other features of the Kt are:

1. Non-use of abbreviations (pratyāhāras)
2. The use of the older self-explanatory technical terminology
3. Non-use of the ekādeśa (a single substitute in the place of two) technique
4. Absence of the treatment of the Vedic words and the rules of accent.
This has made the Kt more popular and simpler grammar. This shows that the nature of the Kt is more pedagogic than theoretical.

# Cāndra Vyākarana 

## Introduction

Candragomin's grammar was meant as an improvement on that of P, Kātyāyana and Ptj, mainly in the way of greater brevity and precision. The work consists of six chapters of four pädas each, the number of rules found therein is 3099 against 3978 of $P$. Each rule is further provided with a Vṛtti, which is traditionally believed to be composed by C himself. However, P. C. Dash (1986:17) has proved that the Sūtras and the Vrtti are works of two different persons. C was the author of the Sütras and the author of the Vrtti was possibly Ācārya Dharmadāsa who is mentioned at the end of the only complete ms. of the CVṛ, which is found in the Durbar library of Kathmandu.

In the main body of the text, C also retains the broad dichotomy of grammar as analytical and synthetic, which was observed in the Aṣt:

|  | Aṣt | CV |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Analytical | Chp.s 1-5 | Chp.s 1-4 |
| Synthetic | Chp.s 6-8 | Chp.s 5-6 |

Author and Date
The earliest reference to Candrācārya is found in Bhartṛhari 's Vākya ${ }^{1}$ where Candrācārya is said to be the one who revived the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yah Pātañjalaśsṣyebhyo bhraṣto vyākarañāgamaḥ /
    kale sa dākṣ̄̄nātyeṣu granthamātre vyavasthitaḥ //
    parvatād āgamaṃ labdhvā bhāṣyabījānusāribhih /
    sa nīto bahumārgatvaṃ candrācāryādibhih punaḥ //
    (Vākya II.480-481)
broken Mahābhāṣya tradition in Kashmir. According to S. K. Belvalkar (1976:48-49), the date of Candragomin is 470 A.D.. However, the first reference to the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa outside the Cāndravṛtti (CVr 2.2.68), is found in the Vāmanalingānuśāsana (800 A.D.) in which there occurs a famous line:

Candropajñam asamjjñakaṃ vyākaraṇam /
Scholars generally differ on the issue of the identity of Candrācārya mentioned in Vākya and the author of the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa. In the view of P. C. Dash, it would be safe to place Candra some time before $8^{\text {th }}$ cent. A.D.

# Nature 

The purpose of the CV was to ærearrange the grammatical material with the object of bringing together all the rules that deal with the same phonetic or grammatical operations as well as the same part of speech'. For the same purpose, its author has employed certain changes in the existent pattern of the Aṣt. These include

1. Restructuring the sections of the Aṣt ${ }^{1}$
2. Reconstruction of some Pāṇinian rules either to remove apparent lacuna or to facilitate the pronunciation
3. Lessening the number of pratyāhāra sūtras by one ${ }^{2}$

The number of technical terms used by C is limited. In many cases, C has avoided the use of a technical term and has instead used its paraphrase. For instance, for P's upadhà, C has upànta, for P's $\bar{n} i$, he has antyajàdi. As it has already been pointed out, the Pali grammar of Mogg is greatly influenced by the CV.

# Omissions in the Cāndra Vyākaraṇa 

1. The treatment of the Vedic words and the rules of accent
2. Most of the technical terms
3. The entire Ekaśesa (part retention) section of P (1.2.64-73) is excluded in the CV though referred to in the Vṛtti on CV 2.2.87.

## Alterations made by Candra in the arrangement of the subject matter

1. C has shifted a section dealing with the verb morphology immediately after an opening section dealing with the operational rules. This is followed by the morphology of nominal inflections and syntax.
2. C refrains from defining various kāraka categories. He has simply merged the kāraka section of the Aṣt with a section dealing with the allocation of cases.
3. The categories of karmapravacanīyas and gatis, which are discussed by P in the section dealing with particles, are treated separately by C in their relevant context. For instance, karmapravacanīyas are discussed under the section dealing
with syntax whereas gatis are discussed in the compound section in the context of the gatisamāsa.
4. In the same vein, C has also brought the rules dealing with the gender and number of compounds under the samāsa section unlike P who treats them elsewhere.

For the rest of the text, C has generally followed the arrangement of P . Cf. for instance, the arrangement of the section dealing with the verb morphology, the treatment of samāsānta suffixes under the Taddhita section and the arrangement of rules in the synthetic part.
# Observations 

1. All the Pali grammars begin with benediction including the salutation to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. K and Agg have also discussed the purpose of their grammars. Mogg alone has mentioned the name of the object language (Māgadha) in his benediction.
2. The broad dichotomy as analytical and synthetic, which is observed in the Ast, can also be seen in each individual chapter of all the three Pali grammars.
3. All the three Pali grammars begin their description with a complete list of alphabets. The Ast and the CV open up with the pratyāhārasūtras, which do not provide a complete list of the Sanskrit alphabets. The Kt on the other hand presupposes knowledge of the alphabets.
4. K and Agg follow the same practice of the Sanskrit grammarians of introducing the basic terminology at the beginning of their grammar. The terminology related to a particular topic, is, however, introduced in that particular section. Mogg on the other hand introduces definitions of all the terms used by him at the beginning of the MV.
5. Like P and C, Mogg mentions all the operational rules in the first chapter.
6. Agg is the only Pali grammarian who has dealt with the Pali phonetics. He has included a small section by the name sikkhāvidhäna in between the sections dealing with the basic and the auxiliary technical terms. The treatment of the Sanskrit phonetics does not form a part of the actual treatise of the Sanskrit grammar. It rather serves as an appendix to these grammars.
7. Like Sarva, the Pali grammarians treat sandhi in the first chapter. P and C , on the other hand, have dealt with it at the end of their grammars.
8. Following Sarva, K and Agg have treated the kārakas and the vibhaktis in one place. P on the other hand has treated them at two separate places. Like C, Mogg has merged together the sections on the kārakas and the vibhaktis. He has, however, shifted the section dealing with syntax before the section on the nominal inflection.
9. P and K follow the same sequence in the treatment of various kārakas except karana and adhikarana. In the Kacc, adhikarana is treated before karana. The sequence of kārakas found in the Kacc and the Kt is exactly identical. This order is fixed according to the principle of posteriority. This shows the relative importance of the cases in the syntax of these languages. Agg on the other hand has followed an altogether different sequence in the Sadd. Like C, Mogg refrains from defining the various kāraka categories.

| Ast | Kacc and Kt | Sadd |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Apādāna | Apādāna | Kattā |
| Sampradāna | Sampadāna | Hetukattā |
| Karana | Adhikarana | Kamma |
| Adhikarana | Karana | Karana |
| Karma | Kamma | Sampadāna |
| Kartā | Kattā | Apādāna |
| Hetukartā | Hetukattā | Adhikarana |
10. Mogg and C follow the same sequence in the treatment of cases. The other grammarians differ from each other on this issue.

| Ast | Kt | Kacc | Sadd | MV and CV |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Acc | Nom | Nom | Nom | Acc |
| Dative | Acc | Instr | Acc | Instr |
| Instr | Instr | Dative | Instr | Dative |
| Abl | Dative | Abl | Dative | Abl |
| Loc | Abl | Acc | Abl | Loc |
| Nom | Gen | Loc | Loc | Nom |
| Gen | Loc | Gen | Gen | Gen |

11. Like C and Śarva, the Pali grammarians have treated the kammappavacanīyas in the vibhatti section. P on the other hand, treats them in the nipāta section.
12. Like C, Mogg has dealt with the category gatis in the compound section in the context of the gatisamāsas. P on the other hand has dealt with gatis in the section dealing with particles.
13. The suffixes to etc. denoting the sense of a case ending and some morphological changes caused by the taddhita suffixes are treated by K and Agg in the section dealing with the nominal inflections (Kacc 249-262; Sadd 492-508). Mogg on the other hand, has treated them in the taddhita section (MV
4.95-4.117, 4.135-4.138) as done by the Sanskrit grammarians ${ }^{1}$.
14. K and Agg have also treated the feminine suffixes in the same section along with the nominal inflections ${ }^{2}$. Mogg on the other hand has dealt with the feminine suffixes in the chapter dealing with compounds (MV 3.26-39). P and C have treated the feminine suffixes separately before the taddhita section. However, in the Kt , they are treated in a separate book, which serves as an appendix to it.
15. Like C and Śarva, the Pali grammarians have brought together rules pertaining to the number and the gender of compounds and the related morphology in the compound section unlike P who gives them elsewhere.
16. The ordering of samāsas in the Kacc and the Sadd differs from that of the Sanskrit grammarians. Mogg on the other hand has followed the same sequence as that of C. Note that the Dvigu type of compounds are not treated separately by these two grammarians. The ordering of compounds may be enumerated as below:

| Aṣt | Kt | Kacc, Sadd | MV and CV |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Avyayī- <br> bhāva | Karma- <br> dhāraya | Abyayī- <br> bhāva | Avyayībhāva |
| Tatpuruṣa | Dvigu | Kamma- | Tatpuruṣa |

1 Cf. P 5.3.1: prāg diśo vibhaktiḥ; Kt 2.6.24: vibhaktisaṃjñā vijñsyā vaksyante'tah paraṃ tu ye / advyādeh sarvanāmnas te bahoś caiva parāh smutāh //
2 Cf. Kacc 237-242, Sadd 466-472 deal with the feminine suffixes. Kacc 263271 and Sadd 509-518 deal with the morphophonemic changes caused by the taddhita suffixes.
|  |  | dhāraya |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Dvigu | Tatpuruṣa | Digu | Karma- <br> dhāraya, <br> Dvigu |
| Karma- <br> dhāraya | Bahuvrīhi | Tappurisa | Bahuvrīhi |
| Bahuvrīhi | Dvandva | Bahubbīhi | Dvandva |
| Dvandva | Avyayī- <br> bhāva | Dvanda |  |

17. Rules regulating the sequence of words in a compound, which are found in the Aṣt and the Kt are missing in all the three Pali grammars.
18. K and Agg have included ekasesa and compounds of numerals within the taddhita section. Mogg on the other hand, has included morphology related to the compounds of numerals in the compound section (MV 3.91-106) and has not dealt with the ekasesa. Note that C and Sarva have also omitted the treatment of ekaśesa. P on the other hand has dealt with the ekaśesa in the first chapter.
19. Like the Kt , in the Kacc and the Sadd, the suffixes that are instrumental in deriving the derivative verbal roots and conjugational affixes (vikaranas) are treated in the same chapter along with the verbal inflections. Cf. Kt 3.2.2-3.2.39; Kacc 435-454; and Sadd 906-933. However, in MV, they are treated before a section dealing with the primary derivatives (krdantas) like Aṣt and CV. Cf. MV 5.1-5.26, P 3.1.5-3.1.90 and CV 1.1.17-102.
20. Like Sarva, the Pali grammarians have treated tenses and moods at the beginning of the verbal inflection. P and C on the other hand have treated them in the same section with that of the primary derivatives.
21. Agg has dealt with the $n v \bar{a} d i$ suffixes in the same chapter with that of the primary derivatives. These suffixes are, however, treated in a separate section in the Kacc by the name of nvädikanda. In the MV and other Sanskrit grammars, the $n v \bar{a} d i$ / unädi suffixes are given in the form of an appendix.
# Chapter Two 

## Technical Terminology

## Introduction

Ptj observes in the Mbh that the main purpose of coining the technical terms is brevity: laghvartham hi samjñäkaranam (Mbh I.39). Äpiśali seems to have first enunciated the principle of brevity in the field of grammar. ${ }^{1}$ This principle gradually gained popularity and reached its peak in Vopadeva, the author of Mugdhabodha who replaced all the bigger meaningful technical terms by the monosyllabic ones. These grammarians cherished the brevity of expression to the extent that the brevity of even half a morae was considered equal to the joy arising from the birth of a son. ${ }^{2} \mathrm{P}$ stands in between these two since he retains some of the bigger meaningful technical terms such as käraka, sarvanäman etc. besides creating a few arbitrary terms.

The school of the Kt , however, advocated the principle of brevity in regard to the sense and method to be superior to the brevity in regard to the expression. Trilocana, the author of the KVP, says:
"'Isn't it true that even the earlier teachers, who, being grammarians, were also seeking for brevity, formulated the bigger technical terms such as svara etc.? (Then the reply is): 'Yes! because of their meaningfulness.' (In this case,) the underlying meaning is this: The brevity is of two types: the one achieved through the letters and the other through the sense. Out of these, the brevity achieved through

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Äpiśalyupajñam guruläghavam / (Kāśikā 6.2.14)
    2 ardhamāträläghavena putrotsavam manyante vaiyäkarañāh /
the sense is intended by them, as it is beneficial for others. Therefore, Sarvavarman also states the same, for, there is no wisdom whatsoever in using symbols such as $v r$ or $k s ̣ a$ for $v r k s ̣ a$ '". 1

The Pali grammarians have followed the footsteps of Sarva and have given preference to the well-established self-explanatory technical terms though some arbitrary technical terms such as jha, $l a, p a, g h a$ and $g a$, still got their way into these grammars.

The samjnass or technical terms of P are divided by Ptj into two classes: krtrima (artificial) and akrtrima (natural). ${ }^{2} \mathrm{P}$ has used selfexplanatory terms such as avyaya, prātipadika, sarvanāman etc. but at the same time he has made use of short, artificially coined technical terms such as $t i$, $g h u$, bha etc. We can also think of a third category of technical terms representing a particular grammatical process such as krt, taddhita etc.

The artificially coined terms can be further subdivided into two groups:

1. There are technical terms, which appear to be fully arbitrary such as $t i$, $g h u$ and $b h a$.
2. The technical terms, which are made by using the technique of abbreviation, such as $a c$, hal, sup generally known as pratyāhāras. Such abbreviations are formed by joining an initial item to be denoted with an indicatory letter of the last item to be denoted in the series.

The technical terminology used by the Pali grammarians would also fall into two categories of natural and artificial. Natural technical terms include terms such as rasso, dīgho, niggahīta etc. The number of artificial terms used by the Pali grammarians is limited. There are five such terms viz. jha, la, pa, gha and ga, which are common to all the three Pali grammarians. The term nad $\bar{\imath}$ denoting feminine stems ending in $\bar{\imath}$ and $\bar{u}$, which is used by K (Kacc 340) and Agg (Sadd 725), is absent in the MV.

The Pali grammatical tradition is in favour of the threefold classification of the technical terms into (i) anvattha (meaningful), (ii) saka (indigenous), and (iii) para (foreign). According to this tradition, akkhara is anvattha sañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$, vagga is sakasañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}^{1}$ and ghosa is parasañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a} .^{2}$

According to another classification found in the Sadd, they fall into two categories: mūlasañña (the basic technical terms) and upakaraṇasañña (the auxiliary technical terms). The basic terms include terms such as akkhara, sara, byañjana etc. The auxiliary terms, on the other hand, include terms necessary for the sandhi operations such as pubba, para, lopa, āgama etc. ${ }^{3}$

As it would be clear from the following discussion, in the case of technical terms, the Pali grammarians have mainly followed the Kt and not P. Even Mogg, who generally follows C, has followed Sarva in case of definitions of some basic technical terms such as sara, byañjana, hrassa, dīgha etc. The obvious reason for this shift

1 Here it should be noted that vagga which is rendered as sakasañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ by the author of Mmd, is, however, a well-established technical term in the field of the Sanskrit grammar and thus cannot be called a sakasañ $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ in a strict sense.

2 tividhā hi saññā - anvatthasaññā, sakasaññā, parasaññā ti / tā pana akkharavaggaghosasaññädivasena dīpetubbā / (Mmd 9)
3 Cf. Sadd 24: pubbaparādīni sandhikiriyopakarañāni /
in the case of Mogg is that C has generally avoided the use of technical terms. ${ }^{1}$

# The Grammatical Terminology of the Atṭhakathās 

Unlike the Prakrit grammarians, the Pali grammarians from K onwards tried to depict Pali as an independent language distinct from Sanskrit. In this context, they also tried to develop a fullfledged grammatical system for Pali with the indigenous Dhātupātha and Ganapātha. However, with regard to the technique and terminology, the Pali grammarians heavily drew upon the Sanskrit grammarians. This does not mean that there was a total absence of grammatical knowledge in the pre-Kaccāyana era. The pre-Kaccāyana Atṭhakathā literature of the commentators like Buddhaghosa, Dhammapāla and Buddhadatta is full of grammatical discussions. In Vism and Atṭhakathās, Buddhaghosa has occasionally discussed the points of grammar in order to explain a syntactical problem, a particular construction or the derivation of a particular word. Though these discussions are mainly based on the Pāninian grammar, the terminology found therein is sometimes so distinct that they have no parallel in the Sanskrit grammar. This has made scholars like R. O. Franke to assume the existence of a pre-Buddhaghosa Pali grammar. However, according to O. H. Pind (1997: 26) 'the rudimentary character of the vocabulary would seem to indicate that it was established for exegetical purposes, its nature being dictated by its relevance for the canonical exegesis and the wish to use a distinct Pali terminology for this purpose, rather than with the intention of establishing a comprehensive Pali grammatical system'. This shows that by the time of the Atṭhakathās, the Pali scholarship started showing its inclination towards an indigenous tradition of the Pali philology independent of Sanskrit. The scope of this terminology is limited to:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 In the tradition, C's grammar is described as cundropajñam asamjñakam vyākaranam / (CVṛ 2.2.68)
A. Phonological terminology
B. Case terminology
C. Two sets of terms denoting four types of nominals
D. Terms denoting the parts of speech
E. A term denoting an adverb
F. Terms denoting words, sentences and syllables
A. Phonological Terminology: A list of ten phonological terms occurs at Sp 1399 in a verse form in the context of the correct pronunciation of Pali in the kammaväcā. The verse reads:
sithilaṃ dhanitaṃ ca dīgharassaṃ garukaṃ
lahukaṃ ca niggahītam /
sambaddhaṃ vavatthitaṃ vimuttam dasadhā
vyañjanabuddhiyā pabhedo //'
Out of these, the first six terms denoting different varieties of phonemes occur for the first time at Mil 344. ${ }^{2}$ The terms such as dīgha (long), rassa (short), garuka (metrically long) and lahuka (metrically short) are common to both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammars. The terms sambaddha (connected utterance) and vavatthita (disjoint utterance) are used to denote the connected or disjoint articulation of the words in a sentence. In Sanskrit, the conjunct articulation of the Vedic hymns is called Saṃhitā whereas the disjoint articulation is known as Padapātha. The remaining terms viz. sithila (nonaspirated stops), dhanita (aspirated stops), niggahīta (nasal) and vimutta (oral) are unparalleled in Sanskrit. Out of these, the term niggahīta equivalent to the Sanskrit anusvāra is adopted by all the three Pali grammarians. Agg is the only Pali

1 The same verse is also quoted at Rüp 10.
2 ye pana te mahārāja bhikkhu bahussutā āgatāgumā dhammadharā vinayadharā mätikadharā sithila-dhanita-dīgha-rassa-garuka-lahuka-kkhara-paricchedakusalā navangasāsanadharā, evurūpā kho maharāja bhikkhu bhagavato dhammanagare dhammarukkhā ti vuccanti/
grammarian who has included all these terms in his grammar and has defined them in rules Sadd 4-21. This attempt of his appears to be encyclopedic since terms sithila, dhanita, vimutta, sambaddha and vavatthita are not used by him in the later part of his grammar.
B. Case Terminology : The Pali Atṭhakathās have made use of the following terms to denote the grammatical cases:

| Paccatta | Nominative | Nissakka | Ablative |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Upayoga | Accusative | Sämi | Genitive |
| Karana | Instrumental | Bhumma | Locative |
| Sampadāna | Dative | Ālapana | Vocative |

Out of these, nissakka, bhumma and ālapana are peculiar to Pali.

Ālapana is the only term, which has a canonical status. It is used in Vin (III.73, 33) to denote the voc., and as such is adopted by the grammarians from K onwards.

The term puccatta (Skt. Pratyātma). in the sense of the nominative. probably occurred for the first time in the vārttikas of Kātyāyana (Vt. 6 on P 1.1.50). It literally means 'individually'. According to O. H. Pind (1997: 27): "The use of the term paccatta is motivated by the semantics of the Pali paccatta, evoking the idea of the nominative as denoting any given thing individually, i.e., its character as such, and thus roughly corresponds to the concept of linga".

The use of the term upayoga in a technical sense goes back to Mbh I. 334 where Ptj introduces a ślokavārttika ${ }^{1}$. enumerating

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Ślokavārttika is a grammatical injunction given in a verse form and is different from the celebrated Mīmāṃsā text Ślokavārttika of Kumārilabhaṭta.
the roots governing two accusatives. The verse reads as follows:
duhiyācirudhiprachibhikșiciñām upayoganimittam apūrvavidhau/
bruviśāsigunena ca yat sacate tad akīrtitam
ācaritaṃ kavinā //
The same verse is reproduced at Kāśikā 1.4.51. There the term upayoganimitta is explained as:
"Upayoga means that which is closely connected (with an action), such as milk etc. Its cause is cow etc. The designation karman is ascribed to cow etc. which is the cause of milk etc. that are closely connected (with an action)". ${ }^{1}$

Thus, in this context, the word upayoga signifies a direct object. The cause of this direct object is called upayoganimitta to which the karma designation is attributed by P 1.4.51.

The term used for the ablative is nissakka ( $n i+s a k k$ ) meaning 'to go out'. It is probably chosen for the given purpose as it conveys an away movement, which is the central idea conveyed by the ablative.

The term sāmi (Skt. svāmin) has its counterpart used in the discussion in Mbh I.464, where the expression svāmitva is used of the genitive relation rājñah puruṣah. At Kt (II.4.19), svāmyādi is used to represent all the relations denoted by the genitive. The term sāmi is adopted by the Pali grammarians to denote the genitive.

The term bhumma is equivalent to the Sanskrit bhaumya or bhūmya and is related to place. It occurs in the canon as an

[^0]
[^0]:    1 upayujyate ity upayogah payahprabhṛti / tasya nimittam gavādi / tasyopayujyamānapayahprabhṛtinimittasya gavādeh karmasaṃjñā vidhīyate /
adjective and a noun. ${ }^{1}$ Agg, whose grammar is influenced by the Aṭthakathās, has occasionally resorted to this Aṭthakathā terminology in the Kārakakappa. Cf. Sadd 597: Paccatte, Sadd 662: samaye karaṇopayogabhummavacanāni pitakakkumena.

# C. Two Sets of Terms Denoting Four Types of Nominals: 

i. The four types of nominals mentioned by Buddaghosa (Vism 209, 29) are:
a. $\bar{a} v a t t h i k a$, referring to a specific state (in the existence of an entity) < Skt. āvasthika; e.g., vaccho
b. lingika, referring to a characteristic mark, e.g., dandī
c. nemittika, referring to an attribute (of a person), e.g., tevijjo
d. adhiccasamuppanna, spontaneous like proper nouns, e.g., sirivaddhaka.

This terminology occurs in a discussion on the word bhagavat. It seems that this terminology is a result of a combination of Sanskrit and Pali features, made for a particular exegetical purpose. ${ }^{2}$
ii. Another Set of Four Nominals is mentioned by Buddhaghosa (As 390, 29).
a. sāmaññanāma, a name given by general assent, e.g., mahāsammato (D III 93, 11)
b. guṇanāma, a name expressing an attribute, e.g., Bhagavat. This term is analogous to naimittikanāma of the above list.
c. kittīnāma, a name expressing honour, i.e., a proper name given at the birth ceremony

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhātāni bhummāni (Sn 222), sabbubhummā khattiya (Saddh 420).
    2
    Pind (1997: 29)
d. opapattikanāma, original name, i.e., a name that is unalterably the same in time and space: purimakappe pi cando etarahi pi cando yeva / (As 391, 13)

This terminology is hardly used in the Pali grammatical literature.
D. Terms Denoting the Parts of Speech: The Pali Aṭthakathās mention four parts of speech (padavibhāga) viz. nämapada, äkhyātapada, upasaggapada and nipātapada. Sv 26, 9ff (on D I 1,4) identifies evam as a nipātapada, me etc. as a nämapada, pati (of the pp. patipanno) as an upasaggapada, and hoti as an $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a p a d a$. This fourfold classification is first mentioned in the Nir. In this tradition, it is known as catvāri padajātāni. In the view of the grammarians, it refers to the fourfold classification of speech into nāma, ākhyāta, upasarga and nipāta. ${ }^{1}$ Ptj has also mentioned this fourfold classification in his Mbh. Thus, in the case of the padavibhāga, the Aṭthakathākāras seem to have been inspired by the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.

This terminology has also found its way in the Pali grammatical parlance. K has named the second chapter of his grammar as the Nāmakappa. The rule, which prescribes compounds in his grammar, reads: nāmānaṃ samāso yuttattho (Kacc 318). The third chapter of K's grammar is called $\bar{A} k h y a ̄ t a k a p p a$. The terms upasagga and nipāta are used by him in the rule: upasagganipātapubbako abyayībhāvo / (Kacc 321)
E. A Term Denoting An Adverb: bhāvanapuṃsaka is the term used in the Aṭthakathās to denote an adverb. It probably means 'a word in neuter denoting bhāvai, i.e. an action'. In the discussion at Sadd 590, Agg observes:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tad yāni catvāri padajātāni nāmākhyāte copasarganipātāś ca tānīmāni bhavanti "Now, what (are) the four classes of words? They are the following: noun and verb; preposition and particles." (Nir 1.1)
"Here in this regard, the designation bhāvanapumsaka occurs in the dispensation whereas kiriyāvisesuna in the science of grammar". ${ }^{1}$

The term is, however, not used by K and Mogg.
F. Terms Denoting Words, Sentences and Syllables : Terms nāmakāya, padakāya and vyañjanakāya in the sense of a collection of words, sentences and syllables occur in a passage at $\mathrm{Sp} 223,22-24$, presumably quoted from the Mahāatṭhakathā. This vocabulary seems to have originated in the Sanskrit Buddhist literature and can be traced to the Vaibhāsika therories of language, which Vasubandhu criticizes in the Abhidharmakoṣabhāṣya.

Although this limited vocabulary as shown above was available to K and his successors, they have preferred the use of only those terms, which were also established in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition except nigguhīta, ālapuna and bhāvanapuṃsaka. The Pali grammarians seem to have thought it better to use the terminology current in the grammatical parlance rather than the orthodox terminology used in the Atṭhakathās. K has acknowledged his indebtedness to the Sanskrit grammars regarding the technical terminology in the rule parasamañña payoge (Kacc 9). By this rule, K has accepted the use of several technical terms current in Sanskrit grammars without ever defining them. Here the Vutti comments:
"And those technical terms available in the Sanskrit treatises such as ghosa or aghosa are also used in this science, whenever there is an occasion for it"2.

Commenting on the rule, the Kacc-Vṇ says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ettha ca bhāvanapuṃsakaṃ ti sāsane vohāro, kiriyāvisesunam ti saddasatthe /

    2 yā ca puna sakkattaganthesu samaññā ghosā ti vā aghosā ti vā, tā payoge sati etthā pi yujjante /
"The foreign terminology is the terminology of others. It means the terminology of the grammarians ... or the foreign terminology is the terminology found elsewhere. It means the terminology available in the Sanskrit treatises. Payoga (usage) means using whenever there is an occasion for the usage, this is the relation. Foreign terms are: ghosa, aghosa, lopa, vanna, samāna, samyoga, linga, pada, nipāta, upasagga, paccaya etc.". ${ }^{1}$

This shows that K's grammar presupposes the knowledge of Sanskrit grammars in general and its technical terminology in particular. Later, Agg has done away with this rule of K by providing definitions of most of them.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 paresam samañña parasamañña, veyyākarañānam sumañña ti attho ... parasmiṃ vā samañña parasamañña, sakkattaganthe samañña ti vā attho / payujjanam payogo, tasmim payoge satt' ti sambandho / parasamañña nāma ghosāghosalopavaṇnasamānasamyogalingapadanipātopasaggapaccayādayo/
# Phonetic Terminology 

## 1. akkhara, vanna

A.

Akkhara (Skt. aksara) and vanna (Skt. varna) are two well established terms. The primary meaning of the term aksara is 'imperishable' and that of varna is 'colour'. Afterwards, they came to signify 'a letter' or 'a syllable'. It seems that the term aksara was used for 'letters engraved on stones' because of their long lasting nature. Varna, on the other hand, was used for letters, which were covered with the coating of some colour (K. C. Chatterji, 1964: 279, fn). Batakrishna Ghosh (K. C. Chatterji, 1964: 279) says in his article on 'Aspects of Pre-Pāṇinian grammar':
"This meaning of the word varna should have been developd first in the Brāhmaṇas of the Sāmaveda in which we constantly come across locutions like rathantaravarnā $r c$ 'verse which gets the colour of the rathantarā sāman in a chant'. In these passages the word varna is visibly changing it's meaning from 'colour' to 'sound' of melody. Thus gradually the 'sound of melody' became 'sound in general'".

Even in Pali, the primary meaning of the term akkhara is 'constant, durable, long lasting' (D III.86). At D I.88, it is used as a name of one of the four branches of the Vedic learning. $\bar{A} k k h a r a$ (nt.) is used in the sense of 'sounds, tones, words' (Mil 344, Pv-a 280). Agg uses the term akkharacintaka 'ponderers of letters' for the grammarians (Sadd 696). Vanna in Pali has several denotations such as 'colour' (Sn 447), 'appearance', 'praise' etc. (PED 596-
97). In the grammatical literature, it came to signify a phoneme probably due to the influence of Sanskrit.

The Pali grammarians have used both the terms akkhara and vanna side by side. Mmd explains akkhara as:
"Akkharas (letters) are so called as they do not perish". ${ }^{1}$

The term akkhara is derived by Agg in two ways:
"In what sense are they akkharas (letters)? By way of being imperishable and by way of not being rough. Whatever perishes or is destroyed is called 'perishable' (khaya) and that which is rough and hard is called 'hardened' (khara). These letters neither perish nor get destroyed even though they happen to exist in the five ways of knowledge, viz., suñkhāra, vikāra, lakkhuna, nibbāna, and paññatti, but are still seen over and again. And even though they are used in the capacity of subtle and profound signals, they do not become rough and hard but remain rather very soft and are not hardened with respect to the meaning. Therefore, they are called letters (akkharas). Now in this respect, this is the meaningful analysis: akkharas are so called as they do not perish. They are called letters as they do not perish even though they are just forty one in number and are used in infinite expressions". ${ }^{2}$
1 na kkharantī ti akkharā / (Mmd 2)
2 kena atthena akkharā: akkhayatthena akkharatthena ca; yam hi khayam gacchati parihāyati, tam khayam ti vuccati; yam pana kharam hoti thaddham, tam kharam ti vuccati, - Ime pana vannā sañkhāra-vikāralakkhaṇa-nibbāna-paññattisañkhātesu pañcasu ṅeyyapathesu vattumānā pi neva khayam gacchanti na parihāyanti uparūpari dissanti, atisukhumagambhīrasaṃketesu parivattumānā pi kharattam thaddhabhāvaṃ na gacchanti ativiya mudu hutvā atthavasena na kharanti, tasmā
These explanations of the term akkhara are attempts to adapt the well-established derivation of the term to suit the Buddhist philosophy which believes in impermanence of all conditioned things. The second derivation is based on the Pali form of aksara, where kṣara becomes $k k h a r a$, which has a sense of 'hard or rough' in both Sanskrit and Pali.

Agg derives the word vanna from the root vanna, 'to tell', in the sense of agent or instrument:
"Vannas are so called as the meaning is expressed i.e. manifested by them or by means of them". ${ }^{1}$

K's rule akkharāpādayo ekacattālīsam (Kacc 2) ascribes the term akkhara to 41 letters of the Pali phonology. In this case, by using akkhara instead of vanna, K has deviated from the Kt , which he generally follows. The term vanna is, however, used by him in the rule ivanno yan na vā (Kacc 21). In this case, vanna is equivalent to 'a phoneme' as it stands for both, the short and the long varieties of $i$. Cp. Mmd 21 (p. 65-66):
"How the phoneme $\bar{\imath}$ is included when the text says 'the phoneme $i$ '? By virtue of having the same form". ${ }^{2}$

In the first rule of the Sadd's Sandhikappa, Agg has used the term vanna to denote syllables: appabhut' ekatālisa saddā vanṇa
"The term vanna denotes forty-one sounds starting from $a . "$ (Sadd 1)

The next rule akkharā ca te "And they are also called letters" (Sadd 2) ascribes the term akkhara to these syllables.
akkharā ti vuccanti / ayam pana ettha sādhippāyo viggaho - na kkharantī ti akkharā, pamānato ekacattālīsamattā yeva hutvā anantam abhidheyyam pì patvā na khīyantī ti attho ti / (Sadd 2)
1 vannīyati kathīyati attho etehī ti vannā / (Sadd 1)
2 ivanno ti vuttattā ivanno kathạ̣ sangahạ̣ gacchatī ti ? samānarāpattā/
Mogg ascribes the term vanna to 43 syllables ${ }^{1}$ starting from $a$ : aādayo titālīsa vanṇā / (MV 1.1)
" $a$ etc. forty-three are called 'vaṇṇa' (phonemes)."
Here MVu reads:
"The forty-three letters starting from $a$ upto the niggahīta are called 'vaṇṇā' (phonemes)". ${ }^{2}$

This shows that the terms akkhara and vanna are synonymous. However, as in the Kacc, in the Sadd and the MV, any letter when followed by the word vanna stands for itself as well as for its homophones. ${ }^{3}$

# B. 

Akṣara in the sense of 'a syllable' is in use since the time of RV (1.164.24, 1.164.39). Later, at the time of RP, as an imperishable and indivisible entity it came to signify 'a vowel':
ojā hrasvāh saptamāntāh svarānām / anye dīrghāh /
ubhaye tv akṣarāni / (RP 1.17-19)
Ptj, while commenting on a ślokavārttika, explains the term akṣara thus:
"Now what is this aksara? By aksara one is to understand what is not ksara (perishable), i.e. aksara is that which does not decay or perish. Or, aksara is -sara added after the root as. This is the

1 Mogg gives a list of 43 letters including short $e$ and short $o$. Note that Sadd 22 also accepts short $e$ and short $o$ in some cases.

2 akārādayo niggahītuntā tecuttālīsakkharā vanṇā nāma honti /
3 vannaparena savanno'pi / Vannasaddo paro yasmā tena savanno'pi gayhati sam ca rāpam / (MV and MVu 1.24)
yam ivanno na vā / (Sadd 51)
unādi suffix -saran added to the root as. Akṣara is so named because it pervades". ${ }^{1}$

Commenting on the rule anekäksarayos tv asamyogād yavau ( Kt 2.2.59), Durga says:
"The etymology is: aksara is that which neither decays nor perishes". ${ }^{2}$

The A $\bar{A}$ and the Mbh of Ptj have used the term Akṣarasamāmnāya in the sense of Varnasamämnāya. Commenting on a line of a ślokavārttika, varnaṃ vā’’ huh pūrvasūtre ${ }^{3}$ Ptj says:
"Or, in a previous sūtra-work, the technical term aksara is used for a letter". ${ }^{4}$

Kt , which belongs to the Aindra school of grammar, opens up with the rule:
siddho varnasamāmnāyah / (Kt 1.1.1)
It, however, also uses the term aksara:
anekäksarayos tv asamyogād yavau / (Kt 2.2.59)
Later, grammarians who are always after brevity have preferred the use of the disyllabic term varna over the trisyllabic term aksara.

P and C have not used either aksara or varna in their respective grammars. In their system, 'a phoneme' in general is referred to as al in rules like anekāl s̄it sarvasya (P 1.1.55), śid anekāl sarvasya (C 1.1.12); aprkta ekāl pratyayah (P 1.2.41) etc.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 atha kim idam aksaram iti? aksaram na kṣaram vidyāt / na kṣīyate na kṣaratīti vā’kṣaram / aśnoter vā saro'kṣaram / aśnoter vā punar ayam aunādikah saran- pratyayah / aśnuta ity aksaram / (Mbh I.36)
    2 na kṣarati kṣīyate vā’kṣaram iti niruktum / (Kt 2.2.59)
    3 "Or, a letter is called aksara in an earlier rule".
    4 athavā pū̃vasūtre varṇasyākṣaram iti samjjñā kriyate /
# C. 

Thus, aksara and varna are well-established technical terms of early origin. P and C have avoided the use of these terms by using the abbreviated term (pratyāhāra) al. Sarva has retained these terms in his grammar. The Pali grammarians have also accepted and used these terms in their respective grammars.

## 2. savanna

## A.

The term savanna (Skt. savarna) literally meaning 'having the same colour' is an older term. In the grammatical literature, it signifies 'a homophone' i.e. 'a letter having the same sound'. The Pali grammarians have followed the tradition of the TP and the Kt and have restricted the savanna designation to the vowels.

Though K has not defined savanna, he has accepted it by the rule parasamañña payoge (Kacc 9). ${ }^{1} \mathrm{~K}$ has made use of the term asavanna in the rule kvacāsavannam lutte (Kacc 14). Commenting on this rule, Vajirabuddhi explains asavanna as:
"The term savanna (homophone) denotes similar phonemes. And that which is not a homophone is called asavanna (a dissimilar phoneme)". ${ }^{2}$
Cp. DT 1.1.4:
"A homophone denotes similar phonemes". ${ }^{3}$
Agg and Mogg have provided the formal definitions of savanna. Sadd 8a says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 parasamañña nāma ghosāghosalopqvannasamānasamyogulingapadanipātopasaggapaccuyādayo / (Kacc-Vṇ 9, p. 27)
    2 samāno vanṇo savannno / na savunnno asavannno / (Mmd 2)
    3 samāno varnah savarnah /
$a \bar{a}$ avaṇno, $i \bar{\imath}$ ivaṇno, $u \bar{u}$ uvaṇno, te eva yugalā savannā, ekārokārā asavaṇ̣̄̄/
"The phoneme $a$ denotes the letters $a$ and $\bar{a}$, the phoneme $i$ denotes the letters $i$, and $\bar{i}$, the phoneme $u$ denotes the letters $u$, and $\bar{u}$. These very pairs are homogeneous letters. Letters $e$ and $o$ are not homogeneous".

This explanation of savanna is on the lines of the Kt (See below). The term savanna is further explained by Agg as:
"There, the homogeneous sounds are those having the same articulatory organ, i.e. having the same place of articulation". ${ }^{1}$
According to Agg, here the word vanna signifies articulatory organ (karana). ${ }^{2}$ This explanation of savanna appears to be an attempt to corroborate the view of the Pāninīyas (See below). The idea of identical effort (prayatna) is, however, missing in Agg's explanation.

MV's definition: dve dve savannā "Each pair (of vowels) is homogeneous" (MV 1.3) runs on the line of dve dve savarne hrasvadīr ghe (TP 1.3) and tesām dvau dvāv anyonyasya savarnau (Kt 1.1.4). The influence of the DV is also visible on the MVu. Cp.:
tesu dve dve sarā savannāa nāma honti (MVu 1.3)
teṣām eva daśānām yau dvau dvau varṇau tāv anyonyasya savarnasamjñakau bhavatah / (DV 1.1.4)

K and Agg have used an additional term sarūpa to signify homogeneous sounds. It is explained as 'letters having the same

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tattha savannā ti samānakarana, samānakkharuppattiṭhānā ti vuttam hoti / (Sadd 8a)
    2 vannasaddo cettha karunavācako daṭhabbo / (Sadd 8a)
form', ${ }^{1}$ which is further explained by Agg as 'having the same 'phonetic quality'. ${ }^{2}$ The term asarūpa is used at Kacc $13^{3}$ and Sadd 31.4

# B. 

The discussion on savarna as a technical term of grammar is found in the Prātis̄ākhyas. RP and TP explain savarna in the context of vowels:
"In the statement regarding the place of articulation as also of contraction of vowels, we are to understand the homogeneous vowels - long and short, even when only the short vowel is mentioned". 5
"Each pair of long and short [vowels] is homogeneous". 6

VP has brought even consonants within the scope of savarna:
"Those sounds, of which the place of articulation, the articulatory organ, and the effort in the mouth are identical, are homogeneous". 7

Just as the VP, P also extends the savarna designation to the consonants. Cf. e.g., P 1.1.69: anuditsavarṇasya cāpratyayah /
"A phoneme denoted by the abbreviation an or one having the marker $u$ as it denotes (not only itself but

1 samānaṃ rūpaṃ yassa so sarūpo / (Mmd 13)
2 sarūpā ti samānasutino / (Sadd 31)
$3 v \bar{a}$ paro asarūp $\bar{a} /$
4 paro vā asarūpā /
5 sthānaprašleşopadeśe svarān̄āṃ hrasvādeśe hrasvadīrghau savarnau / (RP 1.55)

6 dve dve savarne hrasvadīrghe / (TP 1.3)
7 samānasthānakaraṇāsyaprayatnah savarnah / (VP 1.43)
also) all phonemes homogeneous with it unless it is an affix".

He defines savarna as:
tulyāsyaprayatnam savarnam /
"The technical term savarna (homogeneous) designates phonemes which are produced by the same articulatory effort at the same point of articulation in the oral cavity." (P 1.1.9)

Ptj explains the rule thus:
"Tulya means that which is measured with a balance, āsyaprayatnam means mouth and effort, that which has the same mouth (= place of articulation) as well as the same (articulatory) effort is called savarna". ${ }^{1}$
āsya here stands for āsyasthāna and prayatna for ābhyantaraprayatna. Cp. Kāśikā on P 1.1.9:
"That which exists in the mouth i.e. the places such as palate etc. Prayatna is making an effort; which is an attribute of a phoneme such as contact etc.". ${ }^{2}$

C uses sasthāna for savarna. Cf. halo jharām jhari sasthāne lopo vā (CV 6.4.155). It corresponds to P's halo yamām yami lopah (P 8.4.64) and jharo jhari savarne (P 8.4.65). C also uses the term savarga to denote the homogeneous class consonants: ut $\bar{a}$ savargah / (CV 1.1.2)

Kt follows TP in its explanation of savarna. Kt. 1.1.4 states:
teṣạ̣ dvau dvāv anyonyasya savarnau /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tulayā sammitam tulyam, āsyaṃ ca prayatnaś ca āsyaprayatnam, tulyāsyaṃ ca tulyaprayatnam ca savarnasamjñam bhavati /
    2 āsye bhavam āsyaṃ tālvādisthānam / prayatanam prayatnah sprstatādir varnagunaḥ/
"Each pair of these (vowels) is mutually homogeneous".

On this, DT comments:
"A homophone is a similar phoneme. By the force of this very statement, it (the term homogeneous) is befitting to the short and long varieties (of vowels) which are of different nature". ${ }^{1}$

# C. 

Thus, with regard to the concept of homogeneity of letters, the Pali grammarians share the view of Sarva and not of P or C .

## 3. sara

A.

In Pali, the term sara denotes 'sound, voice, intonation, and accent'. In A IV. 307 and Mil 340, it occurs in the sense of a vowel, in combination with the term vanna.

All the Pali grammarians have retained the older term sara for a vowel. Unlike their Sanskrit counterparts, they derive the term from the root sara (to move, to go). Mmd explains sara as:
"Vowels are called saras as they move, go, proceed.
Or they are called saras as they instigate the consonants to move". ${ }^{2}$

Agg clarifies it further by saying
"Vowels are called saras as they move, i.e., they become audible. Or they are called saras also

[^0]
[^0]:    1 samāno varnah savarnah, sa punar asmād eva vacanād bhinnajātyor api hrasvadīrghayor upapadyate / (DT 1.1.4)
    2 saranti, gacchunti, pavattantī ti sarā / byañjanāni sarāpentī ti vā sarā / (Mmd 3)
because they instigate the consonants conjoined to them to move i.e., make them audible". ${ }^{1}$
Here it should be noted that the term vyañjana, which denotes a consonant, is derived from the root $v i+a \tilde{n} c u$ (to express or to go). Now if the meaning 'to go' is accepted, there would not remain any difference between sara and vyañjana. Keeping this in mind Mmd remarks:
"Though the consonants also share the qualities of the vowels, they are not called saras for their existence depends on the vowels. Only those (sounds) having an independent existence are called saras". ${ }^{2}$

Agg records an explanation popular in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, which he, however, ascribes to the Nairukta tradition:
"Etymologists, however, say that the vowels are called saras as they shine independently". ${ }^{3}$

The Pali grammarians' definitions of sara follow the pattern of Sarva. Cp.:
tatthodantā sarā atṭ̣ha
"There (in the list of the alphabets), the eight phonemes are the upto the phoneme ' $o$ ' are called saras (vowels)." (Kacc 3)
tattha atṭhādo sarā / (Sadd 3)
"There (in the list of the alphabets), the initial eight phonemes are designated as vowels."
dasādo sarā / (MV 1.2)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 saranti suyyamānataṃ gucchantī ti sarā, attasaṃsatṭhāni vā vyañjanāni sārenti suyyamānataṃ gumentī ti pi sarā / (Sadd 3)
    2 sati pi byañjanānaṃ sarubhāve sarappaṭibaddhavuttitāya te sarā ti avatvā, ye appatibaddhavuttino te yeva sarā ti gahitā ti / (Mmd 3)
    3 neruttikā pana vadanti suyaṃ rājantī ti sarā ti / (Sadd 3)
"The initial ten ${ }^{1}$ phonemes are designated as vowels."
tatra caturdašādau svarāh / (Kt 1.1.2)
"There (in the list of the alphabets), the initial
forteen are designated as vowels."
Note that the rules of the Kt and the Sadd are identical in expression.

# B. 

Svara (a vowel) is also a well-established grammatical term. It seems to be derived from the root $s v r$ 'to sound'. In RV, it is used in the sense of 'a sound'. According to K. C. Chatterji (1964: 219), in the sense of a vowel, it first occurred in the AĀ. Grammarians from Ptj onwards, generally explain svara as that which shines independently. ${ }^{2}$ Under RP 1.3, Uvaṭa explains:
"Vowels are so called because they sound". ${ }^{3}$
DT explains svara thus:
"Vowels are called svaras as they shine independently, i.e., they are capable of expressing the meaning even when they are unaccompanied (by the consonants)". ${ }^{4}$

The word svara occurs four times in the Aṣt, out of which, on three instances, it is used in the sense of 'an accent' whereas according to the commentators, at P 7.2 .18 , it is used in the sense of 'a sound'. Thus, P has not used the term svara in the sense of a

1 Cf. infra, p. 77.
2 svayam rājante svarāh / (Mbh I.206)
3 svaryante śabdyanta iti svarāh / (Uvaṭa on RP 1.3: ete svarāh /)
4 svayam rājanta iti svarāh, ekākino'py arthapratipādanasamarthāh / (DT 1.1.2)
vowel as he uses the pratyāhāra ac for the same. Cf. $\bar{u} k a \bar{l} l o^{\prime} j j h r a s v a d \bar{r} r g h a p l u t a h$ (P 1.2.27) and iko yaṇ aci (P 6.1.77). C follows P in this respect. Sarva, however, has retained the older term svara and has defined it at Kt 1.1.2. Cf. above.

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have adopted the older Skt. term svara to denote a vowel. Their derivation of the word sara is inspired by the Pali form. By not using the pratyāhāra ac like P and C, and by retaining the well-established term sara, the Pali grammarians have shown their proneness to Śarva.

## 4. byañjana / vyañjana

## A.

Byañjana (Skt. vyañjana) (a consonant) is another older grammatical term. It is derived from the root $v i+a \bar{n} j$ (to manifest) and means 'that which is manifested'. In Pali, the term vyañjana denotes: 1. an attribute, a sign, a mark, 2. condiment, curry, and 3. a letter in general ${ }^{1}$ in combination with attha, 'spirit, meaning'. Buddhaghosa at Sp 1399 uses the term vyañjana in the sense of 'a letter' including both vowels and consonants. ${ }^{2}$

1 Though this is the generally accepted meaning of the term, in phrases like sāttham sabyañjanam or atthato byañjanato $c a$, it is also possible to understand the terrm vyañjana in the sense of a suggestion or implication. Here, it should be noted that in Indian poetics, vyañjanā (suggestion) is accepted as one of the three powers of a word, the first two being abhidh $\bar{a}$ and laksuna. Accepting this meaning of the term vyañjana, the abovementioned phrases can be rendered thus: 'having the direct and the suggested meaning' and 'according to the direct and the suggested meaning'.

2 sithilaṃ dhanitañ ca dīgharassaṃ garukaṃ lahukaṃ ca niggahītam / sambaddham vavatthitaṃ vimuttam dasadhā vyañjanabuddhiyā pabhedo //
Following the Sanskrit tradition, the Pali grammarians have restricted the use of the term vyañjana to consonants. Mmd explains vyañjana as:
"The consonants are so called as the meaning is expressed by them". ${ }^{1}$

Agg has mentioned three views on the derivation of the term vyañjana. His first view is very much on the lines of Uvaṭa and Mmd. He says:
"The consonants are called vyañjanas as they express i.e., manifest the meaning". ${ }^{2}$

This is just an amplification of Mmd's definition. The second view, which is ascribed to the Saddhammaneruttikas, is peculiar in itself. According to this view, consonants are so called as they give birth to vowels. ${ }^{3}$ The third explanation: "the consonants (vyañjanas) are so called as they follow the vowels" ${ }^{4}$ reflects the explanation provided by Ptj and Kaiyaṭa. Cf. below. Agg, however, ascribes this view to Vedavid $\bar{u}$ i.e. scholars of Vedic scriptures.

K defines vyañjana as: sesā byañjanā / (Kacc 6)
"The remaining (phonemes) i.e. other than vowels, are designated as consonants".

This has a striking similarity with TP's definition: śeṣo vyañjanāni
"The rest is designated as consonants." (TP 1.1.6)
Agg amplifies K's definition by adding an adjective addhamattā (having half a morae): sesā addhamattā vyañjanā

[^0]
[^0]:    1 byañjīyati attho etehī ti vā byañjanā / (Mmd 6)
    2 attham vyañjayanti pākaṭaṃ karontī ti vyañjanā / (Sadd 6)
    3 saddhammaneruttikā puna 'saraṃ janentī ti vyañjanānī'ti vadanti (Sadd 6)
    4 sare anugacchantī ti vyañjanāni / (Sadd 6)
"The remaining (phonemes) of half a morae are designated as consonants." (Sadd 6)

Addhamattā is explained as:
"Half a time compared to that of a short vowel". ${ }^{1}$
Thus, the time required for pronouncing a consonant is half of that required for a short vowel. This explanation has its roots in the Sanskrit Śikṣā literature:
"A short vowel is of single morae, a long vowel is said to be of two mora, whereas a prolated vowel is to be understood as having three mora. The consonants are, however, of half a morae". ${ }^{2}$

Mogg follows Śarva and defines a consonant as: kādayo vyañjan $\bar{a}$
"The phonemes beginning with $k$ are designated as consonants." (MV 6)

# B. 

With respect to the Sanskrit tradition, the term vyañjana in the sense of 'a consonant' probably occurred for the first time in the Go. Brā. ${ }^{3}$ Ptj explains vyañjana in contrast to svara:
"Svara has indeed a significant derivation: svaras are so called because they shine on their own, a vyañjana is so called because it follows (= dependent on) (a vowel)". 4

1 rassasurato addhamattā / (Sadd 6)
2 ekamātro bhaved hrasvah dvimātro dīrgha ucyate / trimātras tu pluto jñeyah vyañjanam tu ardhamātrukam //
3 udāttodāttadvipada a u ity ardhacatasro mātrā makāre vyañjanam ity āhuh / (Go. Brā. 1.1.25)

4 anvartham khaly api nirvacanaṃ svayaṃ rājante svarā anvag bhavati vyañjanam iti / (Mbh I.206)
Kaiyaṭa, commenting on anvag bhavati vyañjanam, says:
"'Anvag bhavati' means (it) follows. This derivation is mentioned due to the practice of the elite. However, there is not a least phonemic similarity. Or, the root vyañj also means 'going'. Thus, vyañjana is that which goes in many ways on account of its being prone to influence. This is the meaning which the Bhāṣyakāra has stated in a different way". ${ }^{1}$

Commenting on the rule añco'napādāne (P 8.2.48), Ptj explains vyañjana in the sense of 'sauce' thus:
"Vyañjana is derived from the root añj (to manifest), thus vyañjana means 'manifesting'. The bringing back of the senses rendered torpid by oily substances and sweetness to their own natural state is known as rāga, or, in other words, 'sauce'. And there is also the significant derivation: that by which (rasa) is manifested is vyañjana". ${ }^{2}$

Cp. annena vyañjanam (P 2.1.34). Uvaṭa under RP 1.6, however, rightly derives the term vyañjana from $v i+a \tilde{n} j$, 'to manifest':
"Consonants are called vyañjanas as they express or manifest the meaning". ${ }^{3}$

According to DT,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 anvag bhavatiti / anugacchatity arthah / siṣtasamācārāc cedaṃ nirvacanam abhihitam, na tv atra varnasädrṣyaṃ kiñcid asti / atha vā gatir api vyañjer arthah / vividhaṃ gacchaty uparāgavaśād iti vyañjanam ity ayam arthah, paryāyāntareṇa bhāṣyakāreṇābhihitah /

    3 vyañjayanti prakaṭān kurvanty arthān iti vyañjanāni / (Uvaṭa on RP 1.6: sarvah śeṣo vyañjanāny eva /)
"The consonants are called vyañjanas as (the meaning) is brought out by them. As the curry etc. do in the case of rice, so these consonants do in the case of vowels". ${ }^{1}$

P does not define the term vyañjana, but uses the pratyāhāra hal to denote consonants. Here too C follows P.

Śarva, who uses the term vyañjana, defines it as: kādīni vyañjanāni / (Kt 1.1.9)
"The phonemes beginning with $k$ are designated as consonants."

This goes close to the VP's definition: vyañjanaṃ kādi / (VP 1.47)
"The term vyañjana denotes the phonemes beginning with $k^{\prime \prime}$.

# C. 

Śarva and following him, all the three Pali grammarians have retained the term vyañjana. P and C mention consonants by using the pratyāhāra hal.

## 5. rassa, dīgha

## A.

In the canonical and the non-canonical literature, rassa (Skt. hrasva) is used in the sense of 'short'. ${ }^{2}$ At Ja III.489, we come across the expression rassādesa, which denotes 'reduction of a vowel'. At Mil 344, it occurs in the sense of 'a short vowel'. According to the Mmd, the word rassa denotes 'short time' and the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vyajyata ebhir iti vyañjanāni, yathā sūpādīny odanasya, tathemāny api vyañjanāni svarasyeti / (Kt 1.1.9)
    2 D I.193, 223; Sn 633; Dhp 409; Ja I.356; Dhs 617; Vism 272 (def.); Dhp-a IV.184; Ja I. 356
vowel, which requires short time for its pronounciation is called rassa because of a maxim 'Things having a particular duration are referred to by that (name)'. ${ }^{1}$ Also cp. Sadd 4:
"Short vowels are called rassa as they are to be uttered in a short duration". ${ }^{2}$

In Mmd, rassa (a short vowel) is also explained as a secondary derivative from rassa (short time):
"A short (vowel) means (a phoneme) having a short duration". ${ }^{3}$

K defines rassa as: lahumattā tayo rassā / (Kacc 4)
"The three letters of a short duration are designated as short".

Mmd explains lahumattā as:
"'Of a short duration' means 'having a short duration'. A short duration is a short time. Or 'of a short duration' means '(phonemes) that are having a short duration'". 4

Here, the word lahumattā appears to signify a sound, which is metrically short. In this connection, it would be interesting to note that in the Śrautasūtras, hrasva is used in the sense of laghu i.e. prosodically or metrically short. Mmd does not comment on the word lahu but simply explains rassa and dīgha as:
"Short vowels are phonemes of one morae. Long vowels are the phonemes of two mora". 5

[^0]
[^0]:    1 takkālikā pana tabbohārena vuttā / (Mmd 4)
    2 rassena kālena vattabbattā rassā / (Sadd 4)
    3 rassakālam etesam atthī ti vā rassā / (Mmd 4)
    4 lahukam mattam yesan te ti lahumattā / lahukam mattam lahumattam / lahumattam etesam atthī ti vā lahumattā /
    5 ekamattā rassā / dvimattā dīghā / (Mmd 4)
The time signified by matta is equivalent to the time required for blinking of eyes:
"And here the word matta expresses the time marked by blinking of eyes. Thus it should be seen". ${ }^{1}$ (Mmd 4)

Agg has used this information in his explanation of the word mattā. ${ }^{2}$ He defines rassa as:
ekamattā ādi-tatiya-pañcamā rassā / (Sadd 4)
"The first, the third and the fifth phonemes of single morae are designated as rassa".

Mogg has followed Śarva while formulating the rule defining rassa: pubbo rasso / (MV 1.4)
"An earlier (phoneme of each pair) is designated as short".

The shadow of DV 1.1.5 on the MVu is quite visible. Cp.:
dvayor dvayoh savarnasamjñayor yo yah pūrvo varnah sa sa hrasvasamjño bhavati / (DV 1.1.5)
tesu dvīsu yo yo pubbo so so rassasañño hoti / (MVu 1.5)

In literature, dīgha as an adjective denotes 'long'. ${ }^{3}$ At Mil 344, it denotes a long vowel.

K's rule defining dīgha reads: aññe dīgh $\bar{a} /$ (Kacc 5)

1 mattasaddo cettha ... akkhinimmilanasañkhātam vā kālum vadatī ti daṭthabbo /
2 mattasaddo cettha nimmisanummisanasañkhātam parittakālam vadati / (Sadd 4)

3 Vism 272 (def); D I.17; M 1.429.
"Others are long".
This has a striking similarity with RP's definition: anye dīrghāh (RP 1.18). It is hard to say whether K knew Prātisāāhyas or it is just a coincidence that his definitions of vyañjana and dīgha fully match with the definitions found in TP and RP.

Vajirabuddhi, while commenting on this rule, says:
"By not saying that a long vowel is of two mora, K has said 'the rest are long vowels' to include long vowels of two and a half mora". ${ }^{1}$

He , however, does not mention the sound having two and a half mora.

Agg has amended K's rule by including the adjective dvimatt $\bar{a}$ (of two mora), which is said to be the duration of a long vowel. ${ }^{2}$ He says that long vowels are so called because of the long time required for their utterance. ${ }^{3} \mathrm{Cp}$. Mmd:
"'Long' means 'a long duration'. Here too, a phoneme having that particular duration is called long (dīgha) by virtue of that very usage. Or long vowels are so called because they have that duration'". 4

Agg's explanation of rassa and dīgha is inspired by the discussion found at $\mathrm{Sp} .{ }^{5}$

1 dvimattā dīghā ti avatvā 'aññe dīghā'ti vacanaṃ tiyaddhamattikānam pi sangahanattham datthabham / (Mmd 5)

Mogg's definition paro dīgho "The latter (phoneme of each pair) is designated as 'long'" (MV 1.5) agrees verbatim with Kt 1.1.6: paro dīrghah. Here too, the influence of the DV on the MVu is quite evident. Cp .
dvayor dvayoh savarnasamjñayor yo yah paro varnah sa sa dīrghasamjño bhavati / (DV 1.1.6)
tesv eva dvīsu yo yo paro so so dīghasañño hoti / (MVu 1.5)

# B. 

Hrasva is derived from hras, ${ }^{1}$ 'to become or to be short or small'. As a technical term it probably occured for the first time in the Go. Brā. ${ }^{2}$ Dīrgha is an older term than hrasva denoting 'long in space and in time'. It is derived from the root dräghr meaning 'to be long'. Cp.
"Dīrgha (long) is derived from drāgh (to lengthen)". ${ }^{3}$

In the sense of 'a long vowel' it is in use since the time of the Go. Brā. ${ }^{4}$

P defines hrasva, dīrgha and pluta ${ }^{5}$ on the basis of the time required for pronouncing them: ukälo'jjhrasvadīrghaplutah /
long duration. 'A short vowel' means $a$ etc. which is pronounced in half a time". (Sp 1399ff)
1 hrasvo hrasateh "Hrasva (small) is derived from (the root) hras (to become small)". (Nir.3.13)
2 hrasvodātta ekäksara oṃkāro'tharvavede / (Go. Brā.1.1.25)
3 dīrghaṃ dräghateh / (Nir 2.16)
4 dīrghaplutodātta ekäksara oṃkärah sāmavede / (Go. Brā. 1.1.25)
5 Pluta has no place in the Pali phonology.
"(The technical terms) hrasva (short), dīrgha (long) and pluta (prolated) denote (respectively) vowels having the duration of $u, \bar{u}$ and $u 3$ ". (P 1.2.27)
Kāśikā explains it thus:
"A vowel whose time of utterance is similar to that of (the vowels) ( $u, \bar{u}$ or $u 3$ ) is called hrasva, dīrgha and pluta respectively". ${ }^{1}$

C defines hrasva, dīrgha and pluta in his Varnasūtras as:
ekamātriko hrasvah, dvimātriko dīrghah, trimātrikah plutah /
"A short vowel is of one morae, a long vowel is of two mora, and a prolated vowel is of three mora". (CVS 41-43)

Śarva does not define the terms on the basis of the time. He rather mentions their position in the varnasamämnāya: pürvo hrasvah / (Kt 1.1.5)
"An earlier (phoneme in each pair of vowels) is designated as a short (vowel)".
paro dīrghah / (Kt 1.1.6)
"A latter (phoneme in each pair of vowels) is designated as a long (vowel)".

# C. 

Just as P and $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{K}$ and Agg define dīgha and rassa on the basis of the time required for pronouncing them whereas following Sarva, Mogg defines them by refering to their position in the list of the alphabets.

# 6. vagga 

A.

Vagga (Skt. varga) literally means 'a group' or 'a series'. The term is also used to denote a section or a chapter of a canonical book, e.g., Cullavagga, Mahāvagga, Aṭthakavagga, etc. Agg derives the term from the active verb vaggati to which the meaning 'to exist' or 'to be' is ascribed:
"The consonantal classes are called vaggas as they occur by way of five classes of five (phonemes) each". ${ }^{1}$

In another explanation, Agg derives the term from the passive form vaggīyanti of the same root meaning 'to go' and ultimately 'to know':
"Or, the consonantal classes are called vaggas as they are known to exist by way of five classes of five (phonemes) each". ${ }^{2}$

The last explanation accepts vagga as a noun in the sense of a group:
"Moreover, the word vagga denotes a group. Thus, the consonantal classes are designated as vaggas in the sense of a group". ${ }^{3}$

K defines vagga as: vaggā pañcapañcaso mantā / (Kacc 7)
"The term vagga denotes classes of five consonants each upto the phoneme $m$ ".

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vagganti pañcapañcavibhāgena pavattantī ti vaggā / (Sadd 7)
    2 vaggīyanti vā pañcapañcavibhāgena ime ṭhitā ti gamiyanti ñāyantī ti vaggā I (Sadd 7)

    3 api ca samūhattho vaggasaddo, evaṃ samūhatthenā pi vaggā / (Sadd 7)
Thus, K has improved upon Śarva by adding mantā, which sets the upper limit for the class consonants and removes the ambiguity apparent in te vargāh pañca pañca pañca / (Kt 1.1.10)
"Those classes of five consonants each are designated as vargas".

According to the Mmd 7, the suffix so added to pañca in this case is either possessive or denotes division.

Agg defines vagga as: kādi mantā vaggā / (Sadd 7)
"The term vagga denotes classes of consonants starting from the phoneme $k$ upto the phoneme $m$ ".

This definition is ambiguous without the words pañca pañca. It is the commentary, which tells us that there are five vaggas having five consonants each.

Mogg's definition: pañca pañcakā vagg $\bar{a}^{1}$ is similar to the definitions of Śarva and K.

# B. 

About the meaning of the word varga, Durga comments:
"The term varga denotes 'a group' based on similarity". ${ }^{2}$

In grammar, it signifies a class or a series of consonants. In this sense, it occurs in the Śrauta Sūtras ${ }^{3}$ and Prātiśākhyas. ${ }^{4}$ In

1 "The term vagga denotes the five consonantal classes having five phonemes each". (MV 1.7)
2 vargaśabdaḥ samudāyavācī sajātyapekṣayā/ (DT 1.1.10)
3 sparśeṣu svavargyam uttamam / (ĀŚŚ 1.2.16)
4 varge varge ca prathamāv aghoṣau / (RP 1.12)
Prātiśākhyas, the consonant classes are designated after the first mute of that class such as kavarga, cavarga etc. ${ }^{1}$

P uses the letter $u$ to indicate a varga. In his system, when $u$ is added to the first mute of a class, it stands for both itself and its homogeneous letters. He has explicitly mentioned this in the rule: anudit savarnasya cāpratyayah / (P 1.1.69)
"A phoneme denoted by the abbreviation an or one having the marker $u$ as it denotes (not only itself but also) all phonemes homogeneous with it unless it is an affix".

He, however, has not used the term varga.
C has followed the practice of P but has also used the term varga: utā savargah / (CV 1.1.2)

Śarva has retained the older term varga. It is defined as: te vargāh pañca pañca pañca / (Kt 1.1.10)
"Those classes of five consonants each are designated as vargas".

The obvious source of this definition appears to be the Prātisāakhyas. Cp. pañca te pañca vargāh ${ }^{2}$ (RP 1.8) and sparśānām ānupūrvyena pañca pañca vargāh (TP 1.10).

# C. 

Thus, with regard to the concept of vagga, the Pali grammarians are more indebted to Śarva than either to P or C .

[^0]
[^0]:    1 prathamagrahaṇe vurgum / (VP 1.64)
    2 "These five are the five consonantal classes".
    3 "The five classes of consonants in sequence are named the consonantal classes (vargas)".
# 7. garu, lahu 

## A.

Garu (Skt. guru) is another older term. The general meaning of the term is 'heavy' as opposed to lahu meaning 'light'. Besides this, in Pali it is also used in the sense of 'a teacher', 'important', and 'esteemed' (A III.110; S I.24; Sn 326). At Mil 344 and Sv I.177, the terms garuka and lahuka occur in the sense of 'metrically long and short vowels'. At Sp 1399, Buddhaghosa uses the terms garukam and lahukam in the sense of 'a phoneme metrically long and short'. He explains these terms as follows:
"Garukam denotes nothing but a long vowel. Or, that when uttered before a consonant cluster in cases like āyasmato buddharakkhitattherassa yassa nakkhamati. Lahukam denotes nothing but a short vowel or that when uttered not before a consonant cluster in cases like āyasmato buddharakkhitattherassa yassa na khamati". ${ }^{1}$

The Pali grammarians from K onwards have favoured the use of the shorter terms lahu and garu instead of lahuka and garuka found in Sp. K only defines the term garu: dumhi garu/
"The technical term garu denotes a vowel followed by a double consonant (a cluster of two consonants)". (Kacc 604)
dīgho ca /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 garukam ti dīgham eva / yam vā āyasmato buddharakkhitattherassa yassa nakkhamatī ti evaṃ saṃyogaparaṃ katvā vuccati / lahukaṃ ti rassam eva / yaṃ vā āyasmato buddharakkhitattherassa yassa na khamatī ti evaṃ asamyogaparạ̣ katvā vuccati/
"The technical term garu also denotes a long vowel". (Kacc 605)

This appears to be a recast of Buddhaghosa's definition. However, the influence of P's rules: samyoge guru and dīrgham ca (P 1.4.1112) cannot be ruled out.

Agg has defined garu and lahu in five rules (Sadd 9 - 13). Garu denotes a long vowel: dīgho garu (Sadd 9). It also denotes a short vowel before a consonant cluster: samyogaparo ca (Sadd 10). Garu also denotes a short vowel that precedes neither a vowel nor a consonant: asaravyañjanato pubbarasso ca (Sadd 11). In simple terms, it means that the technical term garu denotes a short vowel that either precedes a niggahīta or occurs as a word-final, e.g., sukham, isi; buddham saranaṃ gacchāmi (Sadd 11).

Lahu is defined in the following two rules. Rasso lahu (Sadd 12) says that the technical term lahu denotes a short vowel. Asamyogaparo ca (Sadd 13) adds:
"The technical term lahu also applies to a short vowel not before a consonant cluster".

Mogg has not defined the terms garu and lahu. He has used lahu in MV 5.83: lahussupantassa and guru instead of garu in MV 6.74: gurupubbā rassā re ntentīnam. MV 5.83 is a recast of CV 1.1.52: laghor upāntyasya.

# B. 

The earliest occurrence of the term guru meaning 'heavy' can be traced back to RV 1.39.3 whereas the term laghu meaning 'light' occurs at AV 9.3.24. However, as the technical terms of grammar, they probably occurred for the first time at RP 1.20-21. As a technical term, guru denotes 'a vowel long by nature or by position'. A vowel, which is long both by nature and by position, is known as garīyah. Laghu denotes 'a vowel which is metrically
short'. A short vowel, which stands alone without any consonant, is known as laghīyah. RP defines guru and laghu as follows:
gurūṇi dīrghāṇi / tathetareṣạ̣̄ saṃyogānusvāraparāni yāni / laghu hrasvaṃ na cet samyoga uttarah / (RP 1.20-21, 18.19)

This definition ascribes the technical term guru to long vowels as well as to those before a consonant cluster and an anusvāra. The technical term laghu applies to short vowels but not before a consonant cluster. According to the TP,
"That which either ends in a consonant or even that which is long or that which either precedes a consonant cluster or a nasal, all these are to be known as metrically long (guru). The rest and others are metrically short in its comparison. That which does not end in a consonant, or is short, or that which is not followed by a consonant cluster or which is not conjoined with a nasal, is known as metrically short (laghu)". ${ }^{1}$

The definition found in the CA is:
hrasvaṃ laghv asamyoge / gury anyat / anunāsikaṃ ca / padānte ca / ${ }^{2}$ (CA 1.51-54),

P has used as well as defined guru and laghu. He has defined guru in two rules of the Ast. P 1.4.11 says: samyoge guru /
"The technical term guru denotes a short vowel before a consonant cluster".

1 yad vyañjanāntaṃ yadu cāpi dīrghaṃ saṃyogapūrvaṃ ca tathā̄nunāsikaṃ / etāni sarvāni gurāni vidyāc cheṣāny ato'nyāni tato laghāni // avyañjanāntaṃ yad hrasvam asamyogaparaṃ ca yat / anunusvārasamyuktam yat tal laghu nibodhata // (TP 22.14-15)
2 "A short vowel not followed by a consonant cluster is laghu. Other than this is guru and a nasal and also that which comes at the end of a pada (is guru)".
# Cp. Kāśikā: 

"A short phoneme (vowel) followed by a consonant cluster is metrically long". ${ }^{1}$

P in his next rule dīrgham ca (P 1.4.12) adds:
"The same technical term also applies to a long vowel".

Cp. Kāśikā:
"Even a long vowel is designated as metrically long". ${ }^{2}$

P has used the term in the rules guros ca halah (P 3.3.103), and ijādes ca gurumato'nṛcchah (P 3.1.36).

Laghu is defined in P 1.4.10 as: hrasvaṃ laghu. According to this rule, "the technical term laghu denotes a short vowel".

Cp. Kāśikā:
"A short vowel is designated as metrically short". ${ }^{3}$
The term is used in P 7.3.86: pugantalaghūpadhasya ca /
Though C does not define these terms, he has used them in laghor upāntyasya (CV 6.2.4) and ijāder gurumato'nṛchūrnoḥ / (CV 1.1.52)

Śarva uses guru and laghu at Kt 3.2.19: nāmyāder gurumato'nṛcchah and Kt 3.2.5: nāminas copadhāyā laghoh. He does not define these terms considering them to be quite well known: lokopacārād grahaṇasiddhih (Kt 1.1.23). DV justifies the stand taken by Śarva not to define guru and laghu. According to Durga,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 samyoge parato hrasvam aksaraṃ gurusamjñam bhavati/
    2 dīrghaṃ cäkṣaraṃ gurusamjñam bhavati/
    3 hrasvam aksaraṃ laghusamjñam bhavati/
"One can comprehend laghu and guru nature of short and long vowels from their utterance. Similarly, the guru nature of short vowels before a consonant cluster can be inferred from the negation in the rule nämyäder gurumato'nrccchaḥ ( Kt 3.2.19)". ${ }^{1}$

Therefore, there is no need to define these terms.

# C. 

To sum up, garu / guru and lahu / laghu are used in the same sense in both the Pali and the Sanskrit grammars. Here it should be noted that in Pali, the older terms denoting metrically short and long phonemes were garuka and lahuka. The Pali grammarians have, however, favoured the use of the shorter terms lahu and garu. Mogg uses the younger form guru for garu. The inclusion of the terms garu and lahu found in the Kacc and the Sadd is irrelevant as these terms do not serve any practical purpose. Agg's explanation of these terms reflects the view of the Prātisāāhyas. Though Mogg could have dispensed these terms off, he has preferred to imitate the pattern of C's rules.

## 8. ghosa, aghosa

## A.

The literal meaning of ghosa (Skt. ghoṣa) is 'sound': ghoṣanam ghoṣo dhvanir ucyate says Durga (DT 1.1.11). The same meaning is also attested in Pali. Cp. PED 258:

Ghosa [Vedic ghoṣa ...] 1. shout, sound, utterance (Vin II.155; M I.294; A I.87) ... 2. shouting, howling, wailing (of Petas) (Pv III.3; IV. $3^{6}, 3^{38}$ ).

[^0]
[^0]:    1 hrasvo laghur dīrgho gurur ity uccāranavusād gumyate, tathā sumyoge sati hrasvo'pi guruḥ, gurumato'nrccchaḥ (3.2.19) iti varjanāc ca / (DV 1.1.6)
The term aghosa, however, is not attested in the Canon. Later, following the Sanskrit grammar, the Pali grammarians have used the terms ghosa and aghosa to denote the sonants and surds respectively.

In Kacc 9, K has given acceptance to many technical terms prevalent in the Sanskrit grammar. Vutti on Kacc 9 says:
"Whenever there is an occasion, the technical terms such as ghosa and aghosa, which are found in the Sanskrit (grammatical) texts, are also used in this grammar". ${ }^{1}$

K uses ghosa and aghosa in Kacc 29: vagge ghosāghosānam tatiyapaṭham $\bar{a}$, without defining them. Mmd and Kacc-Vn are also silent in this regard.

Agg defines aghosa and ghosa ${ }^{2}$ in Sadd 17 and 18: pathamadutiyāni so ca aghosā; tatiyacatutthupañcamā yaralavahalā ghosavanto. According to these rules,
"The technical term aghosa applies to the first and the second letter of each class along with the sibilant $s^{\prime \prime}$.
"The technical term ghosavanta applies to the third, the forth and the fifth consonant of each class along with the semi-vowels $y, r, l, v$ and $h, l^{\prime \prime}$.

At Sadd 18, Agg points out that according to the grammarians (Saddasatthavid $\bar{a}$ ), anusvāra is voiced whereas according to Sāsanikas, it is neither voiced nor unvoiced. ${ }^{3}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yā ca pana sakkutaganthesu samaññā ghosā ti vā aghosā ti vā, tā payoge sati etthā pi yujjunte / (Kacc-Vu 9)
    2 In the rule Agg uses ghosavat for ghosa.
    3 saddasatthaviduno niggahītasaṃkhātassa anusvārassā pi ghosavantattam icchanti, sāsanikā pana tassa ghosāghosavinimmuttattam yeva icchanti /
Mogg neither defines nor uses these terms in his grammar. He refers to them by simply mentioning their position in a consonant class, e.g., catutthadutīyesvesam tatīyapaṭhamā (MV 1.35), catutthadutīyānaṁ tatīyapaṭhamā (MV 5.78).

# B. 

As per the Sanskrit tradition, in the $\mathrm{A} \overline{\mathrm{A}}$, where the term ghoṣa occurs for the first time in its technical sense, it denotes a phoneme. ${ }^{1}$ In the same text, it is also used in the sense of 'a vowel'. ${ }^{2}$

In the Prātisāāhyas, the meaning of ghoṣa was changed from 'vowels' to 'voiced consonants'. According to the Prātisāāhyas, the after-effort of ghoṣavat (voiced) sounds is nāda (sonority) and that of śsāsa (unvoiced) is 'breath'3. Thus, the technical term ghoṣa or ghoṣavat applies to sounds having sonority. Aghoṣa is a name given to surds which are pronounced with the help of simple, unintonated breath.

P neither uses nor defines these terms. In his Aṣt, ghoṣa sounds are represented by the pratyāhāra haś (P 6.1.114) and aghoṣa sounds by khar (P 8.4.55). Kātyāyana has, however, used ghoṣa and aghoṣa in his vārttikas. The seventh vārttika on P 1.4.109:

In view of C, anusvāra is voiced: tṛtīyacaturthapañcamāh sānusvārāntaḥsthahakārāh saṃvṛtakaṇṭhāh nādānupradānā ghoṣavuntah / (CVS 32)
1 tū vā etāh sarvā rcah sarve vedāh sarve ghoṣāh ekaiva vyāhṛtih prāna eva, prāna ṛca ity eva vidyāt / (AĀ 2.2.2)
2 tad vā idam bṛhatīsahusraṃ sampannam, tasya yāni vyañjanāni tac charīram, yo ghoṣah sa ātmā, ya ūṣmānah sa prānah / (AĀ 2.2.4)
3 śvāso'ghoṣānām / Itareṣāṃ tu nādaḥ (RP xiii.4-5), nādo'nupradānaṃ svaraghoṣavutsu; aghoṣeṣu śvāsuḥ (TP 2.8-10), śvāso'ghoṣeṣv anupradānah nādo ghoṣavat svareṣu / (CA 1.12-13)
parah sannikarṣah saṃhitā is: hrādāvirāme sparśāghoṣasaṃyoge'sannidhānād asaṃhitam. Ptj discusses ghoṣa and aghoṣa at Mbh I. 61:
"The first two consonants in every consonant class are aghoṣa. They are uttered with an open glottis with breath as their after-effort. ... The third and the fourth in every consonant class are ghoṣavat. They are uttered with a closed glottis with sonority as their after-effort". ${ }^{1}$

However, from Ptj's discussion and the vārttika 7 on P 1.4.109, it appears that a vowel is also included in ghoṣavat.

C in his grammar follows P by using the pratyāhāras haś (CV 5.1.119) and khar (CV 6.4.148). He, however, has discussed ghoṣa and aghoṣa in the Varnasūtras 32 and 29 respectively:
trtīyacaturthapañcamāh sānusvārāntahṣthahakārāh saṃvrtakaṇṭhāh nādānupradānā ghoṣavuntah /
vargānāṃ prathamadvitīyāh saṣasā visarjanīyajihvāmālīyopadhmānīyāśs ca vivrtakaṇṭhāh śvāsānupradānā aghoṣāh /

Kt follows TP in its definition of ghoṣa and aghoṣa letters:
vargānāṃ prathamadvitīyāh saṣasāśs cāghoṣāh /
"The term aghoṣa denotes the first and the second consonants of each class and the phonemes $\dot{s}, s$, and $s^{\prime \prime}$. (Kt 1.1.11)
ghoṣavanto'nye /
"The rest are called ghoṣavat". (Kt 1.1.12)
These rules simply enumerate aghoṣa and ghoṣa sounds without describing their phonetic nature. Durga explains these terms in his Tīkā on the same rules. He says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vargānāṃ prathamadvitīyā vivrtakaṇṭhāh śvāsānupradānā aghoṣāh / ... tṛtīyacaturthāh saṃvrtakaṇṭhā nādānupradānā ghoṣavuntah /
"Surds are those which have little sonority. Here, the negative particle is employed in the sense of 'a little', as in the case of anudarā kanyā (a maid with a slender waist)". ${ }^{1}$

Thus, according to Durga, a little amount of voicing is present even in the aghoṣa letters:
"Sonants are those which have greater degree of sonority. Here, the suffix vuntu is employed in the sense of 'excess', as in the case of udaravatī kanyā (a maid with a big belly)". ${ }^{2}$

Note that Sarva has not included vowels into ghoṣavat. Cf. Kt 1.4.1: vargaprathamāh padāntāh svaraghoṣavatsu tṛtīyān. ${ }^{3}$

# C. 

The terms ghosa / ghosavat and aghosa are borrowed by the Pali grammarians from the Sanskrit grammar, most probably from the Kt . Though both the traditions generally agree on the nature of the sounds as sonants or surds, the Pali tradition differs from the Sanskrit one on the issue of the nature of niggahīta (anusvāra).

## 9. sithila, dhanita

## A.

Sithila literally means 'loose', 'lacid' or 'relaxed' (S I.49, 77; Dh 346; Ja II.140). Another term dhanita literally meaning 'sounded', however, has no canonical status. At Mil 344, these

[^0]
[^0]:    1 aghoṣā iti / na vidyate ghoṣo yeṣạ̣ te'ghoṣāh / iṣudarthe'tra nañ, yathā anudarā kanyeti / (DT 1.1.11)
    2 ghoṣo vidyate yeṣạ̣ te ghoṣavantah, vantur ihātiśāyane, yathā 'udaravatī kanyā' iti /
    3 "The initial consonants of each class occurring as a word-final change to the third (of the same class) before a vowel, or a sonant".
terms denote a particular phonetic quality. At Sp 1399, Buddhaghosa defines these terms as follows:
"Sithila means the first and the third consonants of the five consonant classes. Dhanita means the second and the forth consonants of those very classes". ${ }^{1}$

Commenting on this, Buddhaghosa says:
"In this connection, 'aspiration of the unaspirated stops' means saying sunäthu me instead of sunätu me by uttering th in place of th. Similarly, saying patthakallam, esā $\bar{n} a t t h i$ in the place of pattakallam, es $\bar{a}$ natti. 'Deaspiration of the aspirated stops' means saying bante sanigo instead of bhante sanigho by uttering $b a$ and $g a$ in place of $b h a$ and $g h a$ respectively". ${ }^{2}$

Here it should be noted that basically these terms denote two distinct linguistic phenomena of aspiration and deaspiration. Sithilakarana is loosely pronouncing an aspirated stop whereas dhanitakarana is strongly pronouncing an unaspirated stop. These terms have no parallel in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.

Agg alone has dealt with these terms without ever using them in any rule of his grammar. He defines these terms in Sadd 14-15:
vaggesu pathamatatīyaṃ sithilam, dutiyacatuttham dhanitam /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sithilaṃ nāma pañcasu vaggesu paṭhamatatīyam / Dhanitaṃ nāma tesv eva dutiyacatuttham /
    2 tattha 'sunätu mé ti vattabbe takārassa thakāraṃ katvā 'sunāthu me' ti vacanaṃ sithilassa dhanitakaraṇaṃ nāma / Tathā 'pattakallam, esā ñatti' ti vattabbe 'patthakallam, esā ñatthi' ti ādivacanaṃ ca / 'bhante sañgho' ti vattabbe bhakāraghakārānam bakāragukāre katvā 'bante sañgo' ti vacanaṃ dhanitassa sithilakaraṇaṃ nāma /
"The term sithila denotes the first and the third consonant of each consonantal class. The term sithila denotes the second and the forth consonant (of each consonantal class)".

Further, in Sadd 16, he ascribes the terms aphuttha and phuttha respectively to these sounds: sithilam aphuttham, dhanitam phuttham
"The unaspirated class consonants (sithila) are designated as aphuttha (loosely connected). The aspirated class consonants (dhanita) are designated as phuttha (connected)".

Though Agg has not used the terms sithila and dhanita in his grammar, he has used the other two terms aphuttha and phuttha at Sadd 122-123. ${ }^{1}$

From the viewpoint of the Sāsanikas, amongst twenty five class consonants, sithila consonants i.e. the first and the third consonant of each class are aphuttha (i.e. having slight contact) because while pronouncing these sounds, tongue loosely touches the place of articulation. Dhanita consonants i.e. the second and the forth consonants of each class are phuttha (i.e. having complete contact) because of the complete contact between the tongue and the place of articulation. Cf. Sadd 16. This shows that the Sanskrit grammarians to whom Agg refers to as Saddasatthavid $\bar{u}$ (scholars of the science of speech), differ from the Sāsanikas (scholars of the Buddhist scriptures) in the matter of vocabulary used to denote articulatory efforts (prayatna). In the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, the term sprṣta (complete contact) is an articulatory effort of all the consonants. $\bar{I}$ satsprṣta (slight contact) is an

[^0]
[^0]:    1 phutthakkharasaññoge pubbam aphutthattam; aphutthakkharasaññoge paraṃ kvaci phutthattam /
articulatory effort of semi-vowels. Cf. Si.Kau. 10: sprṣṭam prayatanam் sparśānām, iṣatsprṣtam anthahsthānām /

# B. 

Sithila and dhanita are unique Pali terms denoting a particular phonetic quality, which is a result of linguistic phenomena of aspiration and deaspiration. This terminology is unique to the Aṭthakathā literature. Though Agg has dealt with these terms, he has never used them in his grammar. In this sense, these terms are without purpose in the Pali grammar.

## 10. sambaddha, vavatthita

## A.

Sambaddha literally meaning 'bound together, connected' (Saddh 81) and vavatthita literally meaning 'separated, disconnected' (Vin II. 67 seq.) are peculiar Pali terms. In the technical sense, sambaddha and vavatthita signify connected and disconnected utterance of words in a sentence. As said before, these terms occur in a verse at Sp 1399, in connection with kammavācā. It should be noted that Buddhaghosa has used sambandha for sambaddha. Buddhaghosa defines sambandha and vavatthita as:
"A continuous utterance means talking by connecting a preceding word with the following word as in the case of tunhissa or tunhassa. A disjoint utterance means talking by disconnecting i.e. separating a preceding word from the following word as in the case of tunhi assa or tunha assa". ${ }^{1}$

This seems to be the obvious source of Sadd 19-20:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sambandham ti yam parapadena sambandhitrā 'tunhīssā' ti vā 'tunhassā' ti vā vuccati / vavatthitum ti yam parapadena asambandham katvā vicchinditvā 'tunhī assā' ti vā 'tunha assā' ti vā vuccati / (Sp 1518)
parapadena sambandhitvā vuttam sambaddham /
"A continuous utterance means talking by connecting a preceding word with the following word."
padacchedam katvā vuttam vavatthitam /
"A disjoint utterance means talking after separating one word from the other."

Though Agg has included this terminology peculiar to the Atṭhakathās, he has never actually used it in his grammar.

To show the difference between sambaddha and vavatthita, Agg has provided two canonical examples: 1. anāthapiṇdikassārāme (sambaddha), anāthapiṇdikassa ārāme (D I $178^{3}$ ) (vavatthita), 2. Nārahat' āyasmā ambattho (D I 91 n. 8) (sambaddha), na arahati āyasmā ambattho (D I $91^{27}$ ) (vavatthita). From these canonical examples, it appears that like the Sanskrit words Samhitāpātha and Padapātha, Agg wants to connect these terms specifically to the canonical texts.

# B. 

The Pali term sambaddha in its technical sense is similar to the Sanskrit word samhitā (putting together). The word samhit $\bar{a}$ in its technical sense of 'the closed connection of words' occurs in the Nir for the first time where it is defined as:
parah sannikarsah samhitā / (Nir 1.17)
"The technical term samhitā (placing together) denotes the maximum contiguity of phonemes".

P reproduces this definition verbatim at P 1.4.109. In Prātisāāhyas, the term Samhitāpātha is used as opposed to the Padapātha in the context of a Vedic text. In this context, Padapātha is on even grounds with the Pali word vavatthita. The obvious result of samhit $\bar{a}$ is sandhi i.e. a euphonic combination of
syllables. In this sense, the term sandhi is used in both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammatical literature.

# 11. niggahīta 

## A.

Niggahīta, as a technical term of grammar, is a peculiar Pali term used for the anusvāra of the Sanskrit grammarians. Agg says:
"Niggahīta is a usage found in the scriptures whereas anusvāra is found in the science of grammar". ${ }^{1}$

In the canonical context, however, the term denotes 'restrained, checked, rebuked, reproved' (S III.12; A I.175; Ja VI.493). According to Buddhaghosa, niggahīta is a nasalised vowel articulated by checking the organs of articulation and without opening the mouth. ${ }^{2}$ He further explains the term niggahitavacana with illustration as:
"Instead of saying sunätu me with an open mouth, when one says sunantu me or instead of saying es $\bar{a}$ ñatti when one says esam ñatti by nasalising without opening the mouth, it is called as nasalisation (niggahitavacana) of an unnasalised vowel". ${ }^{3}$

Thus, in this case, the term niggahitavacana denotes a particular mode of pronounciation i.e. the nasalisation of an originally

[^0]
[^0]:    1 niggahītam ti sāsane vohāro, suddasatthe pana tam anusvāro ti vadanti (Sadd 8). It seems that what Agg means to say here is, not simply the science of grammar, but the Sanskrit grammar as no Pali grammarian or commentator has used the term anusvāra to denote a nasal.
    2 niggahītam ti yam karañāni niggahetvä avissajjetvä avivutena mukhena sānunāsikam katıā vattabbam / (Sp 1518 ff )
    3 'sunā̄tu me' ti vivatena mukhena vattabbe pana 'sunantu me' ti vā 'esā ñatti' ti vattabbe 'esam ñatti'-ti-vā avivatena mukhena anunāsikam katvā vacanam vimuttassa niggahitavacanaṃ nāma / (Sp 1519)
unnasalised vowel and at the same time a nasalised vowel as opposed to vimutta, i.e. an unnasalised oral $\bar{a}$.

Here it should be borne in mind that in the view of Buddhaghosa, niggahīta is a nasalised vowel, which agrees with a similar view held by CA about the nature of the anusvāra (See below). All the Pali grammarians have, however, listed niggahīta at the end of consonants, which would give it the status of a consonant by the rule kādayo vyañjanā (MV 1.6). Another point to be noted in this connection is that K uses niggahīta to denote a nasalized vowel at Kacc 8, 30, 37 and 379 but at Kacc 448, 468 and 539, niggahīta apparently denotes any given nasal.

Mmd describes niggahīta in following words:
"Niggahīta is that which is grasped depending on something. If it is asked, 'depending on what', (then the answer is) 'depending on a vowel'. ${ }^{1}$

Buddhappiya propounds the same view, but in addition, he reproduces the definition of Sp quoting a verse at Rūp 10. Agg has presented all this information in the commentary on Sadd 8. ${ }^{2}$

K defines niggahīta as: am iti niggahītam / (Kacc 8)
"The term niggahīta denotes the phoneme am".

[^0]
[^0]:    1 nissāya gayhatī ti niggahītam / kiṃ nissāyā ti ce? saraṃ nissāya / (Mmd 8)
    2 tam puna sāsanikapayogavasena rassasaraṃ nissāya gayhati uccārīyati ti niggahītam ti vuccati, karaṇāni vā niggahetvā avivaṭena mukhena sānunāsikaṃ katvā iritaṃ ti niggahītam, vuttam pi c' etam : niggahītam ti yaṃ karanāni niggahetvā avissaijetvā avivaṭena mukhena sānunāsikaṃ katvā vuttabbaṃ ti / (Sp 1518 ff) (Sadd 8)

    Also cp. Kacc-Vn 8: niggayha gayhatī ti niggahītam / kiṃ niggayha gayhatī ti ? karanaṃ niggayha gayhati / karanaṃ ti nāsikāsañkhātaṃ karaṇam, niggayhā ti niggamhitvā / vuttañ ca - karaṇam niggahetvāna mukhenāvivaṭena yam / vuccate niggahītan ti vuttam bindusarānugam // ti /
This is identical with the definition of anusvāra found in the Kt. K has clearly borrowed this term from the Atthakathās.

Agg amplifies Kacc 8 as:
am im um iti yam sarato param suyyati, tam niggahītam / (Sadd 8)
"The term niggahīta denotes that (sound) which is heard after a vowel in $a m$, im and $u m$ ".

In Pali, niggahīta is always added to a short vowel and is marked by a dot given after a vowel. Cf. Sadd 8:
ahaṃ kevatttagāmasmim ahuṃ kevatttadārako ti iccādisu rassattayato param bindu niggahītaṃ nāmā ti datthabbam / 1

According to Mogg, niggahīta is a meaningful designation. His rule is: bindu niggahītam / (MV 1.8)
"Niggahīta is a dot".
This seems to be styled after the statement of DV:
"A phoneme am, which is a mere dot, is designated as an anusvāra". ${ }^{2}$

Also cp. MVu:
"This phoneme, which is a mere dot, is designated as a niggahīta". ${ }^{3}$

Note that at MVu 3.89, bindu is actually used in the place of niggahīta. Cf.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "In expressions such as ahaṃ kevaṭtagāmasmim ahuṃ kevaṭtadārako etc. a dot occurring after three short vowels is to be understood as niggahīta".

    2 . iti bindumātravarno'nusvārasamjño bhavati / (DV 1.1.19)
    3 yvāyaṃ vaṇno bindumatto so niggahītusañño hoti /
"With reference to the forms tayyogo and mayyogo, there is an elision of a dot (niggahīta)". ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

The literal meaning of the term anusvāra is 'an after-sound' and seems to be specially coined by the grammarians for their own purpose. Durga says:
anusvaryate samlinam śabdyate ity anusvārah $l^{2}$
In the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, there are three views with regard to the status of an anusvāra. According to the first view held by the CA, it is a nasalized vowel. As per the second view held by the $\mathrm{RP},{ }^{3} \mathrm{P}$ and his commentators, ${ }^{4}$ it is either a vowel or a consonant. While commenting on RP 1.5, Uvaṭa says that anusvāra is a different sound altogether. It is neither a vowel nor a consonant. This aphorism simply indicates this fact. ${ }^{5}$ According to the third view put forward by the Vaidikābharaṇa ${ }^{6}$, Yajusābhūṣaṇa ${ }^{7}$ etc. anusvāra is merely a consonant and consists of a half $g$.

P as well as C do not define anusvāra but use it in their respective grammars. Cp. mo'nusvārah / (P 8.3.23; CV 6.4.7)

1 tyyyogo mayyogoti - bindulopo /
2 "Anusvāra is that which sounds after i.e. sounds jointly". (DT 1.1.19)
3 anusvāro ryañjanaṃ vā svaro vā / (RP 1.5)
4 anusvāra-visarga-jihvāmālīyopadhmānīyayamānām akāropari sarṣu ca pāṭhasyopasaṃkhyātatvena I

5 tasmāt svaravyañjanātiriktam anyad varṇāntaram etad ity eva jñāpanaparam evaitat sūtram / (Uvaṭa on RP 1.5)
6 anusvāro'py uttamavad ryañjanam evāsmacchākhāyam / ardhagakārarūpatvāt / (Vaidikābharaṇa under TP 2.30)
7 ... anusvaryate paścārdhe svaravad uccāryata ity anusvārah /
Kt follows VP (8.21) verbatim and defines anusvāra thus: am ity anusvārah / (Kt 1.1.19)
"The term anusvāra denotes the phoneme am".
Durga comments:
"Here, the phoneme $a$ is for the convenience of pronounciation. The phoneme am, which is a mere dot, is designated as an anusvāra". ${ }^{1}$ (DV 1.1.19)

Taking hint from this, some commentators call it bindu, which merely refers to the orthography of the sound. Cf. Rāma Tarkavāgīsa's commentary on the Mugdhabodha ${ }^{2}$ and the Prayogaratnamālā. ${ }^{3}$

# C. 

K and Śarva have defined niggahīta / anusvāra by actually uttering the sound whereas Mogg has given its orthographic description. Though Agg follows K and Śarva, he has also incorporated the information scattered in the other Pali sources.

## 12. vimutta

## A.

Vimutta is a past participle from $v i+m u c$ literally meaning 'freed', 'released'. ${ }^{4}$ As a technical term of grammar, it denotes an oral sound $\bar{a}$. It has no parallel in Sanskrit. In its technical sense, it occurs in a verse at Sp 1399. Buddhaghosa explains the term thus:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 akāra ihoccāraṇārthah / . iti bindumātravarno' nusvārasamjño bhavati /
    2 akāra uccārañārthah, bindudvibindumātrau varṇau kramān $n u($ =anusvāra)vi(=visarga)saṃjñau stah / (Commentary on Mu 19: aṁ ah nuvīl)

    3 eko bindur anusvāras tilavad vā'rdhacandravat / (PR 1.28)
    4 Vin I.8; A IV.75, 179, 340; D III. 97
"Vimutta is an unnasalised vowel articulated with an open mouth without checking the organs of articulation i.e. by releasing them". ${ }^{1}$

Explaining it further, Buddhaghosa says:
"Instead of saying pattakallam with a closed mouth and by nasalising the vowel when one says pattakall $\bar{a}$ with an open mouth and without nasalising the final vowel, it is called the denasalisation (vimuttavacana) of a nasalised vowel (niggahītassa)". ${ }^{2}$

Thus, in this case, by the term vimuttavacana, Buddhaghosa is referring to a phenomenon of denasalisation.

Agg is the only grammarian who has included this term in his grammar. Sadd 21 defines vimutta in the following words:
karañāni aniggahetvā vivatena mukhena vattabbaṃ vimuttam /
"Vimutta is a vowel to be articulated without checking the organs of articulation with an open mouth".

This is an abridged form of the definition found at Sp .

# B. 

Vimutta is a technical term used to signify the vowel $\bar{a}$ and the phenomenon of denasalisation. It is exactly opposite to niggahīta. Though Agg has included this term, he has never actually used it in

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vimuttam ti yaṃ karañāni aniggahetvā vissajjetvā vivatena mukhena anunāsikam akatvā vuccati /

    2 pattakallam ti avivatena mukhena anunāsikam kutvā vattabbe pattakallā ti vivatena mukhena anunāsikam akutvā vacunam niggahītassa vimuttavacanaṃ nāma/
his grammar. Moreover, Agg has also failed in explaining niggahita and vimutta as representing two opposite linguistic phenomena and thus these terms have lost the context in which they are taught in Sp .

# 13. vuddhi, guṇa 

## A.

Vuddhi (Skt. vṛddhi) literally means 'growth, increase, extension'. In Sanskrit, it is used of the vowels $\bar{a}$, ai and au whereas in Pali, it denotes the vowels $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$. Note that the phonemes $a i$ and $a u$ are absent from the Pali phonology. As a result, the Pali grammarians have thought of only one category of vowel gradation comprising of the phonemes $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$. For this, they have adopted only one name vuddhi and thus there remains no scope for the term guṇa which is used by the Sanskrit grammarians to denote the phonemes $a, e$ and $o$.

In this connection, it is noteworthy that the term guṇa occurs only once in the Kacc and the Sadd in a rule: i-ya-ta-ma-ki-esānam antassaro dīgham kvaci dusassa guṇam do ram sakkhī ca (Kacc 644, Sadd 1269). Kacc-Vu and Sadd here understand guṇa as a technical term of grammar signifying change of $u$ to $o$ which is otherwise designated as vuddhi. Cf.
i-ya-ta-ma-ki-e-sa icc etesam sabbanāmānam anto saro dīgham āpajjate, kvaci dusa icc etassa dhātussa ukāro gunam āpajjate / (Kacc-Vu 644)
kvaci dusa icc etassa dhātussa ukāro gunam āpajjate / (Sadd 1269)

Rüp provides an altogether different interpretation of the rule. It understands guṇa in its non-technical sense of 'secondary' or 'subordinate'. Cf. Rüp 572:
imayataamhakimetasamāna icc etesam sabbanāmānam upamānupapadabhāvena disassa dhātussa gunabhātānam anto saro dīgham āpajjate /
Note that Rūp has the root disa instead of dusá. It shows that there is a lot of confusion about the actual reading of Kacc 644 and it is quite possible that the rule became corrupt well before the time of the Kacc-Vu.

It is quite evident that the Pali grammarians have borrowed the term vuddhi from Sanskrit. K defines vuddhi as: ayuvannānạ̣ cāyo vuddhi / (Kacc 407)
"The phonemes $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$ are called vuddhi phonemes of the phonemes $a, i$ and $u$ respectively."1
According to Kacc-Vn 407,
"The particle $c a$ in the rule is for combining another technical term avuddhi (non-vuddhi) which denotes simple phonemes $a, i$ and $u^{\prime \prime} .^{2}$

The Kacc-Vn here remarks that in some old manuscripts of the Kacc, the reading $a$ i $u$ vuddhi "phonemes $a, i$ and $u$ are vuddhi" is also found. This is also the reading found in the Mmd. Thus, one should accept a more reasonable reading after consideration. ${ }^{3}$

At Kacc 403: mā yānam āgamo ṭhāne, the phonemes $e$ and $o$ coming in the place of phonemes $i$ and $u$ are called vuddhi augments. ${ }^{4}$ Note that the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Āpiśali has

1 a iti akāro, i ī iti ivanno, u ū iti uvanno, tesam akāraivanṇuvannāanam ā-e-ovuddhiyo honti yathāsamkhyam / (Kacc-Vu 407)
2 casaddaggahanam avuddhisampindanattham / ākāra-ckāra-okārā vuddhi ca akāra-ikāra-ukārā avuddhi cā ti avuddhim sampingeti / (Kacc-Vn 407)
3 kaccāyanappakaraṇe pana katthaci potthakesu a i u vuddhī ti pi atthi / nyāse pi a i u vuddhi iti pātho atthi / vīmaṃsitvā yuttataraṃ guhetabbam /
$4 i-u$ ice etesam ādibhātānam mā vuddhi hoti, tesu ca e o vuddhiāgamo hoti thāne / (Kacc-Vu 403)
also used the terms vrddhi-āgama and guṇa-āgama. Cf. also Nyāsa on P 1.3.22: āgamau gunavrddhī ātiṣthate. Śarva also uses the term vṛddhi-āgama: na yvoḥ padādyor vṛddhir āgamaḥ ( Kt 2.6.50).

Agg differs from K so far as he ascribes the vuddhi designation to the vowels $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$ irrespective of whether they are the lengthened grades of $a, i$ and $u$ or not. Cf. Sadd 751: $\bar{a}-y$-o vuddhi /

Though the term vuddhi is absent in all the rules of the MV, it occurs several times in the Vutti. Cf. for instance, nakāro vuddhyattho; evam aññatrāpi1 (MVu 4.1) and kakāro avuddhyattho; evam uttaratrāpi² (MVu 5.17). Mogg describes the phenomenon of vuddhi at MV 4.124: surānam ādissāyuvannassāeo nānubandhe, ${ }^{3}$ without using the term.

# B. 

Vrddhi is a much older term than guṇa and is found from RV onwards. As a technical term, however, it neither occurs in Nir, nor in RP, nor in TP. Vrddhi in its technical sense occurs in VP:
taddhite caikākṣaravrddhāv anihite / (VP 5.29)
P's Aṣt begins with the word vṛddhi: vṛddhir ādaic / (P 1.1.1)
"(The technical term) vriddhi denotes the vowel phonemes $\bar{a}$ and the diphthongs $a i$, and $a u "$.

Śarva's Kt, as it has come down to us, ends with vriddhi: $\bar{a} r$ uttare ca vriddhih (Kt 4.4.35). According to P, vriddhi denotes the phonemes $\bar{a}, a i$ and $a u$ whereas according to Śarva, it denotes $a i, a u, \bar{a} r$ and $\bar{a} l$.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "The phoneme $n a$ is for the purpose of vuddhi and so also in other rules".
    2 "The phoneme $k a$ is for the purpose of the prohibition of $v u d d h i$ and so also in the following rules".

    3 "When a suffix with the indicatory phoneme $n a$ follows, the initial vowels $a, i$ and $u$ of a stem are substituted by $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$ respectively".
Śarva stands alone among the Sanskrit grammarians in not admitting $\bar{a}$ into the category of vṛddhi vowels. Cf. Kt 4.2.5-8:
asyopadhāyā dīrgho vṛddhir nāmināminicattsu / sici
parasmai svarāntānām / vyañjanāntānām anitām /
asya ca dīrghah /
C uses ādaic for vṛddhi taking hint from P's vṛddhir ādaic (P 1.1.1). Cf. ādaijādyaco ñyañ (CV 2.4.98), ādaijādyacaś chah (CV 3.2.24), ādaijevādyatah (CV 5.1.83).

In Sanskrit grammar, the vowels $a, e$ and $o$ are known as gunavowels. Of the eminent Sanskrit grammarians, P alone regards $a$ as a guṇa vowel. Sarva regards $e, o$, ar and al as gunas. Cf. Kt 4.4.31: ar pūrye dve sandhyakṣare ca gunah. Bearing in mind P's rule aden் gunah (P 1.1.2), C uses aden் for guṇa. Thus for P's ād gunah (P 6.1.87) C has ād aden (CV 5.1.82).

# C. 

Though the term vuddhi is common to both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammars, both the traditions differ on what it denotes. As said earlier, the Pali grammarians have thought of only one category of vowel gradation comprising of three vowels $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$. It is interesting to note that though two out of these three vowels belong to the guṇa category of the Sanskrit grammarians, the Pali grammarians have opted the name vuddhi for the same. The probable reason behind this seems to be that since the word vuddhi has a positive connotation 'growth, prosperity', the Pali grammarians thought it more auspicious than guṇa.

## 14. upadh $\bar{a}$

## A.

Upadhā (from upa 'near' and $d h \bar{a}$ 'to place') means 'the last but one letter in a word or a stem'. The literal meaning of the term
is, however, 'setting or placing near or next to'. Cf. DT 2.1.11: upadhānam upadh $\bar{a} /$
"Upadh $\bar{a}$ means placing near".
In Pali, the usage of this term is confined to the grammatical literature. The Pali grammarians have taken this term over from Sanskrit. In this regard, Rüp says:
"Upadh $\bar{a}$ is a borrowed term for the pen-ulitmate phoneme"1.

K uses upadh $\bar{a}$ at Kacc 631: gahassūpadhasse vā, without defining it.

At Sadd 1237, Agg defines upadh $\bar{a}$ in an exactly identical fashion with that of Rüp. Cf. antakkharato pubbakkharam upadh $\bar{a}$
"(The technical term) upadh $\bar{a}$ denotes a phoneme preceding a final syllable".

Following C, Mogg uses self-explanatory upanta (penultimate) for upadh $\bar{a}$ in the rule lahussupantassa (MV 5.83). Note that upanta also occurs at Rüp 418.

# B. 

The usage of the term upadh $\bar{a}$ in its technical sense goes back to Nir. There we come across terms such as upadhālopa and upadhāvikāra ${ }^{2}$ where upadh $\bar{a}$ means 'a penultimate phoneme'.

P defines upadhā as: alo'ntyāt pūrva upadhā / (P 1.1.65)

1 upadhā ti antakkharato pubbakkharassa parasamaññā / (Rüp 553)
2 athāpy upadhālopo bhavati / jagmatuh jugmur iti / athāpy upadhāvikāro bhavati / rājā daṇdīti / "Further there is an elision of the penultimate, as in jagmatuh (redup. form of gam, 'they two went'), and jagmuh (redup. form of gam, 'they all went'). Moreover, there is the modification of the penultimate, as in rājā (rājan, 'king'), daṇ̣̄̄ (daṇ̣̄in, 'a staff bearer'), etc.". (Nir 2.1)
"(The technical term) upadh $\bar{a}$ 'penultimate' denotes the phoneme preceding the last one (of an expression)".

Śarva follows P in defining the term. Cf. Kt 2.1.11: antyāt pūrva upadhā /

C uses the self-explanatory term upānta for upadh $\bar{a}$. Thus, C has mād upāntāc ca mator vah (CV 6.3.35) for P's mād upadhāyās ca mator vo'yavādibhyah (P 8.2.9). Note that the term upāntya is first used in the Sāmatantra. ${ }^{1}$

# C. 

To sum up, the Pali grammarians have borrowed the term upadh $\bar{a}$ from Sanskrit. With regard to its usage, K and Agg have followed P and Śarva. Mogg, on the other hand, has followed C by using upanta for upadh $\bar{a}$.

## 15. antassarādi

## A.

In the Pali and the Sanskrit grammars, certain operations are taught with respect to the part of a stem beginning with its final vowel. In Mogg's grammar, this portion is mentioned as antassarādi, i.e. a portion beginning with a final vowel. Cf. MV 4.132: rānubundhentasarādissa / (MVu 4.132)
"When a suffix with an indicatory phoneme $r$ follows, that part of a word beginning with the final vowel is elided"2.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 upāntye / (Sā. Ta. 1.1.4)
    2
    anto saro ādi yassāvayavassa tassa lopo hoti rānubundhe /
The term is missing in the Kacc and the Sadd as these two grammars have adopted a different method. Cf. Kacc 541: ramhiranto rādi no /
"When a suffix with an indicatory phoneme $r$ follows then the final portion of a verbal root upto the indicatory phoneme $r$ is elided". ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

In P's Ast, the last vowel in a word or a stem along with the final consonant or consonants, if any, is called $t i$. It is one of the few monosyllabic technical terms used by P. Cf. P 1.1.64: aco'ntyädi $t i /$
"(The technical term) $t i$ denotes that part of a word which begins with the last vowel".

Śarva uses svarāntya for $t i$. Thus, for P's avyayasarvanāmnām akac prāk țeh (P 5.3.71), Śarva has avyayasarvanāmnah svarād antyāt pūrvo'k kah (Kt 2.2.64).

Taking hint from P's aco'ntyädi $t i, \mathrm{C}$ uses antyajādi for $t i$. Thus, for P's țeh (P 6.4.143), C has antyajādeh (CV 5.3.138).

## C.

From the above discussion, it appears that Mogg has taken hint from C in forming the term antassarädi. In this connection, it should be noted that whenever Mogg uses C's rules in his grammar, he replaces pratyāhāras (abbreviations) with the older well-established technical terms. Thus, in this case, instead of the pratyāhāra ac in C, Mogg uses sara (svara).

[^0]

# 16. anubandha 

## A.

Anubandha (from anu 'after' and bandh 'to bind') literally means 'that which is tagged on' and is used in the grammatical literature to denote a letter or a syllable attached to roots, suffixes, augments, substitutes etc. to indicate their accentuation or some grammatical operation in connection with them or to distinguish them from similar other things and so on. Note that even in the Pali grammar, the indicatory letters perform all these functions except accentuation.

In Pali, the literal meaning of anubandha is 'bondage' (M III.170; It 91). As a technical term of grammar, the word probably occurs for the first time in the Kacc. Cf. Kacc 623: kāritaṃ viya nānubandho, Kacc 642: sacajānaṃ kagā nānubandhe. The term is also found in the Sadd. Cf. Sadd 1267: sacajānaṃ kagā nānubandhe pare. It seems that considering the term as wellestablished, K and Agg have not provided any formal definition of it. Commenting on Kacc 623, Rūp says:
"Anubandha is that which is not used in the actual language". ${ }^{1}$

It is quite conspicuous that this explanation of the Rūp is based on Kt 3.8.31: yo'nubandho'prayogī.

Explaining the nature of anubandhas, Mogg says: sañketo'navayavo'nubandho
"Anubandha is a tag and it does not form a part of any linguistic element". (MV 1.23)
The obvious source of this explanation is CVṛ 1.1.5:
anavayavabhūtaṃ yac cihnaṃ tad asad veditavyam /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 anubandho appuyogī / (Rūp 537)
However, it is interesting to note that though Mogg follows C's explanation, he has not used $i t$, which is the term used by C to express anubandha.

# B. 

Though anubandha appears to be a very ancient term, it is used first in the vārttikas of Kātyāyana, e.g. anubandhakaraṇārthaś ca (Mbh I.13). It is next found in the Kt where it occurs for the first time in the rule: āgama ud anubandhah svarād antyāt parah ( Kt 2.1.6). However, it is interesting to note that the word is not defined at the beginning of the chapter two, but towards the end of the third chapter: yo'nubandho'prayogī/
"Anubandha is that which is not used in the actual language". (Kt 3.8.31)
The commentator Durga explains that the root bandh preceded by the upasarga anu is used here in the sense of 'elision' and supports his explanation with the quotation agniṣomīyo gaur anubadhyatām !

P and his followers, who are seeking after brevity, use the monosyllabic it for the polysyllabic anubandha. P does not define but enumerates it sounds in the rules P 1.3.2 - 1.3.8. He prescribes the elision of these indicatory letters in the rule: tasya lopah (P 1.3.9).

Following $\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{C}$ also uses $i t$. He has described the nature of this it sound in the rule: anamsacilnnam it / (CV 1.1.5)
"An it sound is a mere tag and it does not form a part of any linguistic element".

## C.

The term anubandha is common to all the Pali grammarians and to some Sanskrit grammarians such as Kātyāyana and Śarva. P and C have used the monosyllabic it for the same. With regard to the explanation of the term anubandha, the Rūp has followed the Kt whereas Mogg has followed the CVṛ.
# 17. thāna, karana, payatana 

## A.

In literary Pali, the term thāna means 'a place', karana means 'an instrument' and payatana means 'an effort'. However, in the grammatical context, these words have a special significance. There the word thāna is used in the sense of 'the place of articulation', karana in the sense of 'articulatory organs' such as the tip of a toungue etc. and payatana in the sense of 'articulatory effort' such as voicing, aspiration etc. Agg stands alone among the Pali grammarians in using this terminology in his grammar. He uses this terminology in a small section on the Pali phonetics called sikkhāvidhäna, i.e. Sadd 22-23. Cf. e.g., Sadd 23:
"Phonemes are produced by the means of the place of articulation, articulatory organs and articulatory efforts". ${ }^{1}$

## B.

The Sanskrit terms sthāna, karana and prayatna have the same sense as in Pali. This terminology in its technical sense occurs in the Prātisāakhyas. Cf. Monier Williams (1993:1263, 254, 687).

P uses the term $\bar{a} s y a$ for the place of articulation and prayatna for articulatory efforts at P 1.1.9: tulyāsyaprayatnam savarnam. Cf. Kāsikā:
"Āsya means 'existing in mouth', i.e. the places of articulation such as palate etc. Prayatna denotes articulatory efforts, i.e. the characteristic of a phoneme such as contact etc.". ${ }^{2}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 thāna-karana-payatanehi vannänam uppatti/
    2 āsye bhavam āsyaṃ tālvādisthānam / prayatanam prayatnah / sprṣtādir varnagunah/
Though this terminology is missing in the actual treatises of C and Šarva, it is very frequently used in a number of works on the Sanskrit phonetics ( $\check{S} i k s \bar{a}$ ) and in the various Prakriya works in the Pāninian tradition.

# C. 

Agg is the only Pali grammarian who uses these terms in his work. There is no doubt that he has borrowed this terminology from the Sanskrit sources.
# Terminology Related to the Morphophonemic Changes 

Rules 24 to 26 of the Sadd define some technical terms, which are related with the sandhi operations. Agg calls them upakaranasañña (auxilliary technical terms):
"The terms pubba, para etc. are auxiliaries for the sandhi operations". ${ }^{1}$ (Sadd 24)

They are pubba, para, lopa, āgama, samyoga, viyoga, paranayana, vipariyāya, vikāra and viparīta.

## 1. sandhi

## A.

The word sandhi is derived from the verbal root $d h \bar{a}$ with the suffix sam (putting together). In the opening verses of K's grammar, the grammar is called Susandhikappa (An excellent chapter on sandhi). ${ }^{2}$ The first chapter of his grammar is also named as Sandhikappa. The twentieth chapter of the Sadd also bears the same name. The term sandhi is, however, missing in the MV.

Agg defines the term sandhi as:
sandhīyanti ettha padāni akkharāni cā ti sandhi samhitapadam / (Excursus before Sadd 30 p. 611)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 pubbaparādīni sandhikiriyopakaranāni /
    2 settham tilokamahitam abhivandiyaggam /
    buddhañ ca dhammam amulam ganam uttamañ ca //
    satthussa tassa vacanatthavaram suboddhum /
    vakkhāmi suttahitam ettha susandhikappam //
"Sandhi, a continuous utterance, is that where words or letters are conjoined". ${ }^{1}$.

Commenting on the opening verse of the Kacc, the Kacc-Vn says:
"Placing or joining of two words in an excellent manner without showing any gap is sandhi or conjoining is called sandhi". ${ }^{2}$

# Types of sandhi 

Besides providing a general definition of sandhi, Agg also provides various classifications. According to the first classification, it is of three kinds: sarasandhi (vowel sandhi), vyañjanasandhi (consonantal sandhi) and vomissasandhi (mixed or miscellaneous sandhi).

Agg defines the term sarasandhi as:
"A vowel sandhi is defined as a sandhi in place of vowels or before vowels. Here a sandhi accomplished by either substituting or eliding a vowel is called a vowel sandhi". ${ }^{3}$

Vyañjanasandhi is defined as:
"A consonantal sandhi is defined as a sandhi in place of consonants or before consonants. Moreover, a sandhi accomplished by either substituting or eliding a consonant is also called a consonantal sandhi". ${ }^{4}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 H. Smith records a variant reading samhitāpadam for samhitapadam in one of the MSS. See p. 611, fn c.
    2 dvinnum padānam untaram adassetvā sammāpakārenua dhīyati ghaṭ̣yatī ti sandhi, samodhānam vā sandhi /
    3 sarānam saresu vā sandhi sarasandhi, ettha ca sarādesalopakaranavasena sādhito sandhi sarasandhī ti vuccati / (Excursus before Sadd 30, p. 611)
    4 vyañjanānam vyañjunesu vā sandhi vyañjanasandhi, api ca vyañjanādesalopakaranavasena sādhito sandhi vyañjanasandhī ti vuccati / (Excursus between Sadd 63 and 64)
Vomissasandhi is defined as:
"A mixed sandhi is a sandhi of vowels, consonants etc. that are mingled together. Similarly, a sandhi accomplished by either substituting or eliding either a vowel, or a consonant, or a nasal is called a mixed sandhi". ${ }^{1}$

Here it should be noted that the same type of sandhi is also called a sādhārana or a vutta sandhi in the later classifications:
"That same type of sandhi is also called a miscellaneous (sādhāraṇa) sandhi as it includes multiple operations such as: substitution, elision or modification etc. of a vowel, a consonant or a nasal". ${ }^{2}$
"Similarly, it is also called a vuttasandhi (a sandhi metri causa) when a vowel, a consonant or a nasal is either elided or augmented in keeping with the rules of prosody i.e. metre in case of the gätha literature and for ease of utterance in the prose literature". ${ }^{3}$

The second classification differs from the first only in replacing vomissasandhi by vuttasundhi, i.e. the sandhi metri causa.

According to another classification, sandhi is fourfold, that is to say, vowel sandhi (sarasandhi), nasal sandhi (niggahittasandhi),

[^0]
[^0]:    1 missībhūtānaṃ saravyañjanādīnaṃ sandhi vomissasandhi; tathā hi saravyañjananiggahītādesalopukaraṇavasena sādhito sandhi vomissasandhī ti vuccati / (Excursus bet. Sadd 133 and 134)
    2 so eva saravyañjananiggahītādesalopaviparītādivasena anekasangahattā sādhāranasandhī ti ca vuccati / (Excursus bet. Sadd 133 and 134)
    3 tathā so eva gāthāsu chandānurakkhanatthaṃ vuttianurakkhanatthaṃ ca cunniyapadesu sukhuccāranatthaṃ lopāgamādivasena sādhitattā vuttasundhī ti ca vuccati / (Excursus bet. Sadd 133 and 134)
vowel and consonantal sandhi (saravyañjanasandhi) and miscellaneous sandhi (sādhārana sandhi). ${ }^{1}$

According to another classification, sandhi is twofold: padusandhi (a sandhi of words) e.g., tatrāyam and vannasandhi (a sandhi of phonemes) e.g., sāhu. ${ }^{2}$

Such clear-cut classification of various types of sandhi is not found in both the Kacc and the MV. However, one can infer their existence even in these grammars from their arrangement of the rules of sandhi. For instance, in the Kacc, the second kanda of the Sandhikappa deals with the vowel sandhi. In the third kanda, rules 25 to 29 deal with the vyañjanasandhi. In the forth kanda, rules 30 to 34 deal with the niggahitasandhi whereas in the remaining rules of the kappa, various other cases of the vomissasandhi are dealt with.

In the MV, rules 1.26 to 1.32 and 37 deal with the sarasandhi, 1.33 to 1.36 deal with the vyañjanasandhi, 1.38 to 1.44 deal with the niggahitasandhi whereas the sandhi described in the remaining rules can be labelled as the vomissasandhi.

However, it should be noted that these grammars do not deal with the sandhi metri causa. An additional point about the classification of sandhi requires some attention. Agg has included a small section called the pakatividhāna in the chapter dealing with the sandhi (Sadd 62-63). ${ }^{3} \mathrm{He}$, however, has not treated it as

1 tesu gajjādibhedesu ganthesu pubbaviññāhi /
saravyañjanavomissavasā sandhi tidhā muto //
saravyañjanavuttānaṃ vasenā pi tidhā muto /
aparena nuyenāyaṃ catudhā pi pakāsito //
sarasandhiniggahītasaravyañjanasandhayo /
sādhāraṇo ca sandhī ti catudh' evam pakāsito // (Sadd 27)
2 api c' ettha dvidhā cā pi saṃkhepā sandhi icchito /
padānam padusandhi ca vamnānaṃ vannasandhi ca // (Sadd 27)
3 Note that K also has a small section comprising of rules Kacc 23 and 24 dealing with the phenomenon of non-sandhi (pakati). The treatment of this phenomenon is also found at MV 1.28: na dve vā.
another type of sandhi, as has been done by the school of the Kt. (See below).

# B. 

In case of Sanskrit, the first occurrence of the term sandhi can be traced back to RV 8.1.12 where it occurs in the sense of 'a joint'. In the Prātisāāhyas, it is used in its technical sense of 'the modification of phonemes caused by a close juxtaposition'. As a technical term, it is missing in the Nir and the Aṣt. Another term samhitä, which is also derived from the root $d h \bar{a}$, occurs at the TUp in the sense of 'a conjunction, connection'. Both Y and P have used the term samhitä, to denote a close juxtaposition of phonemes. ${ }^{1}$ According to this view, samhitä is a precondition for sandhi. Note that in the Aṣt, a section dealing with sandhi is headed by the rule samhitäyām (P 6.1.72, 6.3.114). Later, it came to mean 'the modifications caused by such a juxtaposition' - a sense in which the word sandhi is used.

Śarva has preferred the disyllabic sandhi over the trisyllabic samhitä and many later grammarians have followed him in this regard. He uses the term sandhi at na visarjanīyalope punah sandhih (Kt 1.5.16). Here DT explains sandhi as:
"Sandhi is putting together. It is called the utmost juxtaposition of phonemes. And the grammatical operations related to it such as shortening and lengthening etc. are also called sandhi by way of a figurative expression". ${ }^{2}$

Thus, Durga has used the term sandhi in the same sense in which Y and P have used the term samhitä.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 parah sannikarṣah saṃhitā / (Nir 1.17, P 1.4.109)
    2 sandhānaṃ sandhih / utkṛ̣̣to varṇānạ̣̄ sannikarṣa ucyate / tadviṣayam api kāryaṃ samānadīrghādi sandhir ity abhimatam / upaicārāt /
# Types of sandhi 

Though P does not explicitly talk of any classification of sandhi, his followers have classified it in two main categories of ac (vowel) sandhi and hal (consonantal) sandhi.

According to the Rūpāvatāra, the sandhi is of six types, ${ }^{1}$ for instance, tuk² (the sandhi involving the augment tuk), svara, prakrti (the non-sandhi), vyañjana, visarjanīya, and svādi. The school of Kt talks of five types of sandhis, ${ }^{3}$ viz. svara, vyañjana, prakrti, anusvāra (the nasal sandhi) and visarga.

## C.

Both the Pali and the Sanskrit grammarians agree on the denotation of the term sandhi that is 'putting together'. Just as Sarva, the Pali grammarians have preferred the term sandhi and have totally discarded the term samhitä. The heading (adhikāra) samhitäyām in the Aṣt, which has been dispensed off by Sarva long back, is also absent in the Pali grammars.

On the matter of classification of sandhi, it should be mentioned that though K and Mogg have not given a clear-cut classification of various types of sandhis, it can be inferred from the arrangement of their sandhi rules. On the other hand, the classification given by Agg is unique in itself as the categories other than the sarasandhi, the vyañjanasandhi and the niggahītasandhi such as vomissa, vutta and sādhārana are his innovations. The category of vuttasandhi is more striking as it is specially created to accommodate the type of sandhi peculiar to the $g \bar{a} t h \bar{a}$ literature.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tuk svarah prakrtiśs caiva vyañjanaśs ca tutah param / tato visarjanīyaśs ca svādih ṣat sandhir ucyate //
    2 The author of the Rūpāvatāra treats the addition of the augment $t$ before $c h$ in cases like pariccheda as a separate variety of sandhi.
    3 svarasundhir vyañjanasandhih prakrtisandhis tathaiva ca / anusvāro visargaśs ca sandhih syāt pañicalaksanah //
# 2. pubba, para 

## A.

In grammatical treatises, terms such as pubba and para are used to indicate temporal or spatial position of grammatical items such as letters, words etc.

Among the Pali grammarians, Agg alone has treated these terms as technical terms. Pubba and para are defined in following words:
pathamuccāritam pubbam, pacchā uccāritam param / (Sadd 24)
"Pubba is that which is uttered before, and para is that which is uttered after".

K and Mogg have simply used these terms without ever defining them. Cf. for instance: pubbam adhoṭhitam assaraṃ sarena viyojaye (Kacc 10), naye parạ̣ yutte (Kacc 11), paro kvaci (MV 1.27) and pubbassa a (MV 6.18).

Agg and Mogg have also used the term uttara for para especially in context of the final member of a compound. Cf. Sadd 678 and MV 3.54.

## B.

Though the terms pūrva and para are freely used in the Sanskrit grammar of $\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{C}$ and Sarva, they are not treated as technical terms by any of them. In the rule P 5.3.68: vibhāsā supah bahuc purastāt tu, ${ }^{1} \mathrm{P}$ has used the word purastāt for pūrva. He uses the word uttara for para: tasmād iti uttarasya (P 1.1.67), alug uttarapade (P 6.3.1).

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "(The taddhita affix) bahuc is optionally introduced before (a nominal stem ending in) a sup triplet (to denote 'not quite fully')".
# C. 

To sum up, the terms pubba ( $p \bar{u} r v a$ ) and para are common to both the traditions. However, Agg is the only grammarian who treats them as technical terms.

## 3. lopa

## A.

The term signifying elision in the Pali grammars is lopa. It is derived from the root lup 'to break, hurt, injure'. As a technical term of grammar, it is in use since the time of the Aṭthakathās ( Pj II 410; Vv-a 154, 275).

K has used it in sarā sare lopam (Kacc 12) but did not think it necessary to define it. Mmd explains lopa simply as:
"Lopa denotes elision". ${ }^{1}$
In Sadd 24, Agg provides a formal definition of lopa as: sato vināso lopo /
"The term lopa denotes destruction of an existing thing".

This is quite close to the TP's definition. (See below) Here it should be noted that in Sadd 1330: thāne vannavināso, Agg has actually used the word vināsa to denote elision. Further in the text, Agg says:
"When a particular word is not used but its meaning still applies that is also called elision (lopa)". ${ }^{2}$

Cp. Kāsikā on P 1.1.60:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 lutti lopo / (Mmd 12)
    2 yassa attho yujjati saddo ca na payujjati so pi lopo /
"Invisibility, being inaudible, non-utterance, nonavailability, absence, and loss of a phoneme are synonymous". ${ }^{1}$

Here, out of six, the first three meanings agree with Agg's second definition whereas the last three agree with the first.

Apart from this, K and Agg have used the negative particle no to express elision. Cf. for instance, Kacc 580: bhujādinam anto no dvi ca; Sadd 1181: bhujādinam anto no dvittam ca:
"The final syllable of the verbal roots bhuja etc. does not remain and there takes place the duplication of the suffix $t a$ ".

Also cp. Kacc 541: ramhiranto rādi no, which is rendered as ramhi-ranto rādi lopam at Sadd 1124. Also cf. Rüp 542:
rakārānubandhe paccaye pare sabbo dhātranto rādippaccayarakāramariyādo no hoti, lopam āpajjate ti attho /

Mogg uses lopu without defining it: suro lopo sare (MV 1.26), lopo musmā (MV 2.88) etc. Besides lopa, some other forms such as lutti (noun), lutta (past participle) and lopetabba (potential participle) are also used by the Pali grammarians, cf. lutti - Sadd 293, 418; lutta - Kacc 14, Sadd 228, 229, MV 1.29; lopetabba Sadd 238.

# B. 

Lopa has a long history in the Sanskrit grammatical literature. Its first occurrence in the grammatical literature can be traced back to Nir 2.1 where it is used in the sense of 'loss or elision'. Cf.
"Further, there is an elision of the penultimate, as in jagmatuh (red. form of gam, 'they two went'), and

[^0]
[^0]:    1 adarśanam, aśravanam, anuccāranam, anupalabdhih, abhāvo, varnavināśah ity anarthāntaram /
jagmuh (red. form of gam, 'they all went'). ... Further, there is an elision of a letter, as in tatvā yāmi (= tatvā yācāmi) etc. Moreover, there is an elision of two letters, as in trca ( $=$ tri + rca, 'three stanzas)". ${ }^{1}$

Here lopa denotes 'destruction'. TP defines lopa as: vināśo lopah /
"The term lopa denotes destruction". (TP 1.58)
P defines lopa as: adarśanaṃ lopah / (P 1.1.60)
"Lopa denotes invisibility".
This is similar to the definition found in the VP: varnasayādarśanaṃ lopah / (VP 1.147)
"Lopa denotes invisibility of a phoneme".
Here it should be noted that in the Go. Brā., the word adarśana is used for elision. ${ }^{2}$ Vārttikakāra modifies P's definition and says:
"Disappearance of that which is applicable is called as an elision". ${ }^{3}$

P also uses luk, ślu, and lup to denote the elision of suffixes ( P 1.1.61). These three different terms used by P to denote an elision serve different grammatical purposes. The difference between lopa on the one hand and luk, ślu and lup on the other is marked by P in the rule: pratyayalope pratyayalaksaṇam (P 1.1.62) and na lumatā'ngasya (P 1.1.63). According to P 1.1.62, when an affix is elided by using the word lopa, the grammatical operations effected by that affix still prevail as if that affix were still present. This is, however, denied in the case of luk, ślu and lup by P 1.1.63. Another major difference between these terms is that lopa can be

[^0]
[^0]:    1 athāpi upadhālopo bhavati - jagmatuh jugmur iti / ... athāpi varnalopo bhavati - tattvā yāmīti / athāpi dvivarnalopah - trca iti / adarśanam pratyayasya nāma sampadyate / (Go. Brā. 1.1.26) prasaktasyādarśanaṃ lopah/
used for the elision of both prakrti and pratyaya whereas the use of luk, ślu and lup is restricted to the elision of affixes.

C uses lopa without defining it. Thus, he has ino'ci lopah (CV 5.4.41). However, instead of P's luk, ślu and lup, he only retains luk: adādibhyo luk (CV 1.1.83).

In the Kt , lopa alone is used to signify elision: samānah savarne dīrghībhavati paras ca lopam ( Kt 1.2.1). In view of scholars, the mention of luk in some rules of the Kt (Kt 2.1.76, 3.8.29) is a later addition. Cf. K. C. Chatterji (1964: 334-5).

# C. 

Following Śarva, the Pali grammarians have only used the term lopa to denote 'an elision' against the four used by P . The noncanonical status of the term lopa indicates that it is a borrowing from the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.

## 4. $\bar{a} g a m a$

## A.

Āgama is derived from $\bar{a}+$ gam. Thus, $\bar{a} g a m a$ is that which comes, i.e. that which is added. In literature, it denotes a. coming, b. a text, a scripture, c. a rule, d. understanding, and e. repayment (of debt) etc. As a technical term of grammar, it denotes an augment, i.e. a consonant or syllable added or inserted. In this sense, it occurs at Pj II 23. The fact that the term $\bar{a} g a m a$ does not occur in the Canon in the sense of an augment suggests that it is a borrowing.

Mmd explains $\bar{a} g a m a$ as:
"Augments are those which come". ${ }^{1}$
This is equal to

[^0]
[^0]:    1 āgacchantīti āgamā / (Mmd 35)
"An augment is that which comes". ${ }^{1}$
Agg clarifies it further in his definition: aññato vanṇāgamanam $\bar{a} g a m o /($ Sadd 24)
"The term $\bar{a} g a m a$ denotes an addition of a phoneme from outside".

K uses the term in a number of rules without defining it: yavamadanataralā cāgamā (Kacc 35), go sare puthassāgamo kvaci (Kacc 42), sāgamo se (Kacc 61) etc. In his grammar, augments in general are mentioned without any indicatory letter with the sole exception of an augment $n u$ where following Sarva, the augment is mentioned with the indicatory letter $u .{ }^{2}$ As a result, each time there occurs an explicit statement saying that such and such a letter is an augment. There are, however, occasions where such an explicit mention is not found, for instance lopañ ca tatrākāro (Kacc 27), and niggahītañ ca (Kacc 468). In such cases, commentators tell us that these are augments. Kacc has no explicit statement with regard to the position of an augment. A general method adopted in this regard is that the augment is mentioned in the nominative and the grammatical item to which it precedes is mentioned in the locative. Cf. go sare puthassāgamo kvaci (Kacc 42) and sāgamo se (Kacc 61). If an augment is to be inserted within a word, its position is explicitly mentioned, e.g., rudhādito niggahītapubbañ ca (Kacc 448). Here an augment niggahīta is taught with regard to the verbal roots of the rudhādi class and the position of the augment is indicated by the word pubba.

Agg follows K in this regard. Cp. e.g., sare puthassa gāgamo kvaci (Sadd 53), yavamadanataralahā vā (Sadd 56), rudhādito ca, majjhe niggahītam (Sadd 926).

[^0]
[^0]:    1 āgacchatīti āgamah / (DT 2.1.6)
    2 nu niggahītam padante (Kacc 539), padante nukārāgamo niggahītam āpajjate (Kacc-Vu 539). Agg has followed K in this regard. Cf. Saññāyam a, nvāgamo (Sadd 1107), padante nvāgamo niggahītam / (Sadd 1122)
In Mogg's grammar, the word ägama occurs twice in the rules vanataragā cāgamā (MV 1.45) and na te kānubandhanāgamesu (MV 5.85). Out of these, at 5.85 , ägama is used to denote conjugational affixes kn $\bar{a}$ etc. Mogg has adopted two different ways of mentioning the consonantal āgamas. In the first chapter, these augments are mentioned without any indicatory letter, e.g., vanataragā cāgamā and chā lo (MV 1.45-46) whereas from the second chapter onwards, as in Sanskrit grammar, they occur with an indicatory letter $u .{ }^{1}$ Besides this, the indicatory letters $\bar{n}, k$ and $m$, which serve the purpose of deciding the position of an augment, are also added to the augments. MV 1.20 and 1.21 give guidelines regarding the placement of $\bar{a} g a m a s$. According to MV 1.20, ${ }^{2}$ augments with the indicatory letter $\bar{n}$ are added before and those with the indicatory letter $k$ are added after. MV 1.21 says:
"The augments having the indicatory letter $m$ are added after the final vowel". ${ }^{3}$

These rules also tell us that the grammatical item to which an $\bar{a} g a m a$ is to be added is mentioned in the genitive. In this regard, Mogg's indebtedness to C and P is quite evident. Cp. takitāv ādyantau, mid aco'ntyāt parah (CV 1.1.13-14); ādyantau takitau, mid aco'ntyāt parah (P 1.1.46-47). Here MVu's resemblance with $\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{r}}$ is also quite striking. ${ }^{4}$ The only difference is that Mogg uses the indicatory letter $\bar{n}$ instead of $t$ used by P and C . The obvious reason for this shift is that Mogg has used the indicatory letter $t$ to indicate sarvädeśa (a substitute which replaces the entire

```

```
substituendum). ${ }^{1}$ Here, it should be noted that in the grammars of P and C , this purpose is served by the indicatory letter $s,{ }^{2}$ which is absent in the Pali phonology. Mogg has followed this method throughout his grammar except the above-mentioned three rules of the first chapter where the word ägama is explicitly mentioned either in a rule or in the Vutti. In all these rules, augments are mentioned in the nominative. In MV 1.38: niggahītam there is no statement regarding where the augment should be placed. In MV 1.45: vanatarag $\bar{a}$ cāgam $\bar{a}$, the position of augments is indicated by the word in the locative (sure). According to the paribhās $\bar{a}$ sattamiyam pubbassa (MV 1.14), the augments $v, n, t, r$ and $g$ are added before a vowel. At MV 1.46: ch $\bar{a} \mid o$, the ablative and the locative are used with the preceding and the following words between which the $\bar{a} g a m a l$ is to be inserted, the $\bar{a} g a m a$ itself being put in the nominative. From this different style adopted particularly in these three rules, it appears that these rules are modelled after K.

# B. 

Going back to the history of the term $\bar{a} g a m a$, we find that the older name of $\bar{a} g a m a$ was upajana meaning 'addition'. Ptj says:
upajana āgamah / (Mbh I.31)
Both $\bar{a} g a m a$ and upajana occur in Nir 2.2:
"Further, there is anaptyxis, as in āsthat (from the root $a s$, to throw), dvārah (from the root $v r$, door), bharāja (from the root bhrajj, ripe)". ${ }^{3}$

The nature of $\bar{a} g a m a$ is discussed in many grammatical treatises. It is generally contrasted with $\bar{a} d e s ́ a$. Cp. e.g., the following verse in which the view of Āpisali is recorded:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tanubandhānekavannā sabbussa / (MV 1.19)
    2 anekāl šit sarvasya / (P 1.1.55), sid anekäl sarvasya / (CV 1.1.12)
    3 athāpi varṇopajanah / āsthat / dvārah / bharājeti /
"An augment comes in without injury (to the original), a vikāra comes in by smashing i.e. ousting the original, a substitute comes instead of something else and an elision takes place by dragging away i.e. destroying the whole". ${ }^{1}$

Durga also explains ägama in similar words:
"An augment is that which does not injure either the stem or the suffix". ${ }^{2}$

P has not used the term $\bar{a} g a m a$ in his Aṣt. He has, however, mentioned $\bar{a} g a m a s$ with the indicatory letters $t, k$, and $m$, which indicate their position, for instance, the indicatory letter $t$ suggests that the augment is to be added before whereas the indicatory letter $k$ tells us that the augment will be added after. When there is an indicatory letter $m$, the augment is placed after the last vowel of a word. ${ }^{3}$ Besides this, consonantal $\bar{a} g a m a s$ are mentioned with the additional indicatory vowel $u$, e.g., nut (hrasvanadyāpo nut P 7.1.54), muk (āne muk P 7.2.82), and num (idito num dhātoh P 7.1.58). P generally uses the ablative and the locative respectively with the preceding and the following sounds between which an $\bar{a} g a m a$ is to be inserted, the $\bar{a} g a m a$ itself being put in the nominative, e.g., ñnoh kukṭukṡari (P 8.3.28), dah si dhuṭ (P 8.3.29), si tuk (P 8.3.31). In such cases, the indicatory letters $t$ or $k$ are actually insignificant in deciding the position of an augment. There are, however, rules where an item to which an augment is prescribed, is mentioned in the genitive and in such cases, the indicatory letters have their role in deciding the position of that particular augment, e.g., ārdhadhātukasya iḍ valādeh (P 1.1.46).

C follows P in this regard. Cf. takitāv ādyantau (CV 1.1.13) and mid aco'ntyāt parah (CV 1.1.14).

[^0]
[^0]:    1 āgamo'nupaghātena vikāraś copamardanāt / ādeśas tu prasañgena lopah sarvāpakarṣunāt // (KVP 2.1.6)
    2 prakrtipratyayayor anupaghātī āgamah / (DV 2.1.6)
    3 ādyantau ṭakitau, mid aco'ntyāt parah / (P 1.1.46-47)
Śarva also uses the indicatory letter $u$ to indicate the augments, e.g., dhuṭsvarād ghuti nuḥ (Kt 2.2.11). It seems that mentioning the augments with an indicatory letter $u$ was customary among the Sanskrit grammarians. Durga says:
"An indicatory phoneme $u$ is a mark of an augment". ${ }^{1}$

According to Kt 2.1.6:
āgama ud anubandhah svarād antyāt parah /
"An augment having an indicatory letter $u$ is placed after the final vowel".

However, when the case suffixes beginning with the instrumental case suffixes follow, an augment is placed before it. ${ }^{2}$

# C. 

From the above discussion, it is clear that $\bar{a} g a m a$ was a wellestablished term since the time of the Nir. In case of Pali, it was first adopted by the Pali commentators and then by the Pali grammarians from K onwards. The Sanskrit grammarians generally mention the consonantal augments with an indicatory letter $u$. Mogg is the only Pali grammarian who has followed this technique for the most part of his grammar. With regard to the position of the augments, K and Agg have followed the method adopted by Śarva whereas Mogg has followed the method of P and C .

## 5. samyoga and visamyoga

## A.

Saṃyoga, from sam + yuj, is another old technical term. In its primary sense, it denotes 'a contact', or 'an association'. ${ }^{3}$ The term

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ud anubandha āgamasya lingam / (DV 2.1.6)
    2 tṛtīyādau tu parādih / (Kt 2.1.7)
    3 Ja III.12; Vism 495; Pv-a 73 (connection within a sentence - accuntasamyoga), 135 etc.
visamyoga meaning 'disjunction, disconnection'1 can be derived by adding the prefix vi to the word samyoga. The Pali grammarians have used the terms samyoga and visamyoga to denote two different phenomena of conjunction and simplification. The term samyoga is common to both Sanskrit and Pali. Visamyoga, however, does not have its counterpart in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, as the phenomenon of simplification is peculiar to Pali.

Agg defines samyoga as:
sarānantarīkānam dvinnam vā tinnaṃ vā vyañjanānam ekatra sañgati samyogo / (Sadd 24)
"Samyoga denotes a combination of two or three consonants without intervention of a vowel."

It is difficult to point out a single source of this definition. It would, however, be interesting to compare Sadd's definition with the definitions found in the RP, the VP, the Aṣt and the Sār. (See below).

Agg uses the term at Sadd 104, 122, 123, etc. Mogg uses the term samyoga at MV 1.53: samyogādi lopo without defining it. The term samyoga is used by K in the rule vuddhādisarassa vāsamyogantassa sane ca (Kacc 402). However, in the rule dumhi garu (Kacc 604), he has used $d u$ (two) instead of samyoga.

Opposite to samyoga is visamyoga. The technical meaning of visamyoga is 'simplification of a consonant cluster'. Cf.:
vigato samyogo yassa soyam visamyogo / (Mmd 41)
In this technical sense, visamyoga is used by K and Agg:
byañjano ca visamyogo / (Kacc 41)
lutte vyañjane visamyogo / (Sadd 149)
None of them, however, has put forward any formal definition of visamyoga.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Vin II.259, IV.280; D III.230, 276; A II.11; III.156.
# B. 

As per the Sanskrit tradition, samyoga in the technical sense of 'a consonant cluster' is used in the Go. Brā. Its definition is found in RP and VP:
samyogam vidyād vyañjanasañgamam / (RP 18.40)
anantaram samyogah / (VP 1.48)
P agrees with the VP's definition. His definition of samyoga is:
halo'nantarāh samyogah / (P 1.1.7)
"The technical term 'conjunction' denotes an uninterrupted sequence of consonants".
Also cp.: svarānantaritā hasāh samyogah / (Sār 1.14)
C and Śarva simply use the term without defining it:
vā samyogāder asthah / (CV 5.3.79)
samyogāntasya lopah / (Kt 2.3.54)

## C.

Samyoga as a technical term is common to both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammars. Agg's definition of it reflects in itself some of the popular definitions of the term found in the Sanskrit tradition. The term visamyoga signifying the phenomenon of simplification of a consonant cluster is an innovation of the Pali grammarians.

## 6. viyoga and paranayana

## A.

The technical terms viyoga and paranayana are peculiar to the Pali grammar. They are related with the typical method of sandhi
adopted by K and Agg. Viyoga (disjunction) signifies 'separation of a consonant from a vowel'.

Agg, who alone has given a formal definition of viyoga, explains it thus: sarato vinibbhogo viyogo / (Sadd 24)
"Disjoining signifies separation (of a consonant) from a vowel".

It is, however, noteworthy that the term viyoga as it is does not appear in any rule of the Kacc and the Sadd. Both K and Agg have rather used finite verbal form viyojaye of the root $v i+y u j$ in their respective grammars. Cf. for instance, pubbum adhoṭhitam assaraṃ sarena viyojaye (Kacc 10); sarā viyojaye vyañjanam, tañ ca assa pubbe thapeyya (Sadd 28). According to Kacc 10,
"In order to make a sandhi, one should first separate the preceding consonant from the vowel and place it below the separated vowel". ${ }^{1}$

Agg's method is little different from K. According to him, when a consonant is separated from a vowel, it should be placed before and not below the vowel (Sadd 28). This is the first step of a sandhi. It should be noted that Senart interpretes adhoṭhitam in the Kacc as 'final' which makes more sense. However, it does not agree with the description of the Kacc-Vu.

Paranayana i.e. conjoining a preceding letter with the following one is the last step of a sandhi. According to Agg (Sadd 24), paranayana signifies conjoining of a phoneme with another vowel or a consonant:

# sarena vyañjanena vā ekīkaranam paranayanam / 

"The term paranayana denotes unification of a phoneme with another vowel or a consonant".

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tattha sandhiṃ kattukāmo pubbubyañjanam adhoṭhitam assaraṃ kutvā sarañ ca upari kutvā sarena viyojaye /
According to Kacc 11 and Sadd 29, in the final stage of a sandhi, the earlier separated letter is conjoined to the following vowel / consonant. Here too, it should be noted that neither K nor Agg use the term paranayana in the actual rule that teaches sandhi: naye param yutte (Kacc 11), netabbam assaram parakkharam naye (Sadd 29). This peculiar method of making a sandhi is fully explained by F. Masson in his edition of the Kaccāyana grammar. According to this method, the sandhi of tatra + ayam into tatrāyam will be as follows:
a. tatra ayam
b. tatr - ayam (Kacc 10)
c. ta a ayam (Kacc 10)
d. ta a ayam (Kacc 10)
tr
e. ta ayam (Kacc 12)
tr
f. ta $\bar{a} y a m$ (Kacc 15)
tr
g. tatrāyam (Kacc 11)

The terms viyoga as well as paranayana are, however, absent in the Mogg's grammar, as he does not say anything about the method of sandhi. Here it would be interesting to note that the idea of paranayana is touched upon by Sarva: vyañjanam asvaram param varnam nayet ( Kt 1.1.21). ${ }^{1}$ This seems to be the source of Kacc 10-11 and Sadd 28-29, inspite of their different context. Kt

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "A consonant is to be conjoined with the following phoneme but not a vowel".
1.1.21 teaches that only a consonant should be conjoined with the following letter, and not a vowel. ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

Viyoga and paranayana are peculiar Pali terms denoting a special method of sandhi adopted by K and Agg. The apparent source of these is Kt 1.1.21.

## 7. vipariyaya / vipallāsa

## A.

Vipariyaya or vipallāsa are two terms used by the Pali grammarians to describe the phenomenon of metathesis. The term vipariyaya or vipariyāya (Skt. viparyaya) is derived from vi + pari $+i$ and is used in the Atthakathās in the sense of 'a change', 'a reversal'. ${ }^{2}$ The term vipallāsa (Skt. viparyāsa) is derived from $v i+$ pari + asa 'to throw' and in literature, it denotes 'a reversal', 'a change' (esp. in a bad sense) and 'an inversion'. ${ }^{3}$ The form vipariyāsa, which is the diaeretic Pali form founded on Skt., occurs at Vin II. 80 in the same sense. About the form vipariyesa, PED (626) comments that it is a contaminated form between vipariyaya and vipallāsa. It also denotes 'reversal, contrariness, a wrong state'. In this sense, it occurs at Kv 306; Vibh 376. Thus, it is quite clear that the terms vipariyaya and vipallāsa are based on two different Sanskrit forms. However, in the Canon as well as in the commentaries, none of them denotes metathesis.

Agg in Sadd 24 explains vipariyāya as follows:
vaṇnānạ̣ heṭ̣̣hupariyatā vipariyāyo /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vyañjanam parạ̣ varnaṃ nayet, na tu svaram / (DV 1.1.21)
    2 Sv I.148; Pj II 499; DhsA 253; Saddh 124, 333.
    3 Sn 299; Ps II.80; Vism 214 (attha-); Nett 4.27, 31, 85.
"The term vipariyāya denotes reversal in the position of the phonemes".

He uses the term at Sadd 154, 980, 1048, and 1080. At Sadd 672 and 1099, he has also used the term vipallāsa:
"Sometimes there is a transposition of grammatical persons". ${ }^{1}$
"Sometimes there is a transposition of gender, grammatical case, number, tense, person and letters". ${ }^{2}$

Vipallāsa here is used in the sense of transposition or change and not metathesis.

K only uses the term vipariyaya without defining it. See e.g., havipariyayo lo $v \bar{a} /{ }^{3}$ (Kacc 490)

Mogg has only used the term vipallāsa. At MV 1.50: hassa vipallāso, it signifies a metathesis. ${ }^{4}$ However, at MVu 2.3, 2.210 and 3.19, vipallāsa signifies 'trasnsposition'. 5

1 kwaci purisavipallāso / (Sadd 1099)
2 linga-vibhatti-vacana-kāla-puris'-akkharānam vipallāso / (Sadd 672)
3 "When the $h$-ending roots are followed by the suffix $y$, there takes place the metathesis of $h$ (and $y$ ) and the phoneme $y$ is substituted by the phoneme $l^{\prime \prime}$.

4 "When the phoneme $h$ is followed by the phoneme $y$, there takes place the metathesis of $h$ (and $y$ )".

5 vibhattivipallāsena vā buhulam vidhānā / "Or, by transposition of grammatical case, due to the statement 'bahulam'" (MVu 2.3); kathum caturo nimitte näddasāsim ti - lingavipalläsā / "How it is said 'cuturo nimitte näddasāsim' ? By transposition of gender." (MVu 2.210); kwaci vipallāso'pi hoti buhulādhikāruto / "Sometimes, the order is reversed due to the governing rule 'bahulam'". (MVu 3.19)
# B. 

As per the Sanskrit tradition, the term viparyaya is used to denote the phenomenon of metathesis. The term viparyaya is derived from the root $v i+$ pari $+i$ (to go back), in the sense of 'reverse' or 'opposite' of something. It occours in the Nir in the sense of change and metathesis:
"Further, there is alteration in the initial part (of the root), as in jyotih (from dyut, light), ghanah (from han, killer), binduh (from bhid, a drop), vātyah (from bhat, to be hired or nourished) etc. Further, there is metathesis, as in stokuh (from scut, a drop), rajjuh (rope), sikatāh (from kas, sand), tarku (from krt, a knife)". ${ }^{1}$

In Nir, another term viparita is also used to denote the phenomenon of metathesis:
"Or, tālu is derived from the reversed root lat". ${ }^{2}$
Since the phenomenon of metathesis is not dealt with by the grammars of P and C , there was no occasion to use this term.

Sarva has used the term viparyaya at Kt 2.5.23: svare'ksaraviparyayah to denote the metathesis. Here it should be noted that the term viparyāsa occurs in Sanskrit in the sense of 'a change, contrariety, reverse; an interchange' etc., but not in the sense of 'metathesis'. Cf. V. S. Apte (1979:1450).

## C.

Two terms vipariyaya and vipallāsa used by the Pali grammarians to denote the phenomenon of metathesis have no canonical status. They are based on their Sanskrit counter-parts

[^0]
[^0]:    1 athāpi ādiviparyayo bhavati jyotih ghanah binduh vātya iti / Athāpy ādyantaviparyayo bhavuti stokāh rajjuh sikatāh tarka iti / (Nir 2.1)
    2 tālu ... latater vā syāt ... viparī̄āt / (Nir 2.5.6)
viparyaya and viparyāsa. However, out of these two terms, only viparyaya is used in the sense of metathesis in Sanskrit tradition.

# 8. vikāra 

## A.

The term vikāra is derived from the root $v i+\operatorname{kar}$ (Skt. $k r$ ). In literature, the term denotes a. a change, an alteration (Vism 366, 367, Pj I 107); b. distortion, reversion (Vin I.301; Ja II.448) etc. In the grammatical context, it signifies 'modification of a linguistic element'. Another term ädesa (Skt. ädeśa) is derived from the root $\bar{a}+\operatorname{dis}$ (Skt. diś) (to point out, direct, teach). Though the term is generally used in the sense of 'an advice' or 'an instruction', in grammar, it signifies 'a substitute'. In this sense, it occurs at Pj II 303. There the phrase kutonidāna is explained as kinnidāna. Here the commentary remarks:
"Here, to is to be understood as a substitute in the place of a nominative case ending". ${ }^{1}$

Among the Pali grammarians, K and Agg have used both vikāra and ädesa side by side, for instance, tesu vuddhilopāgamavikāraviparītādesā ca (Kacc 406, Sadd 859). Agg explains vikāra as:
vaṇnantaratā ekato saṃyogatā ca vikāro / (Sadd 24)
"Transformation of a phoneme and change of a single consonant into a conjunct is called as vikāra".

In this context, he has also mentioned the views of his predecessors:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 paccattavacanassa to-ädeso veditabbo /
"Transformation of one phoneme into another, simplification of a consonant cluster, and change of a single consonant into a conjunct is called vikāra". ${ }^{1}$

In the commentary on the same rule, Agg also mentions the view of some teachers who distinguish vikāra and ādesa thus:
" $\bar{A} d e s a$ is mentioned with the nominative case ... vikāra with the accusative case". ${ }^{2}$

Kacc 406 is the only rule where K has used the term vikāra. The term ädesa, however, occurs in rules Kacc 17, 406 and 519. Agg also seems to favour the use of the term ädesa as he uses the term at Sadd 165, 236 and 237. Besides these, the term occurs many times in the commentary.

Mogg has not used the term vikāra in its technical sense. Like P and C , he only uses $\bar{a} d e s a$, e.g. at $\mathrm{MVu} 1.19,2.43 \mathrm{etc}$.

# B. 

Like many other terms, vikāra and ādesa are terms of an early origin. In Nir, the term vikāra is used to signify 'change' or 'modification of a phoneme'. Skanda and Maheśvara, the commentators of the Nir, explain vikāra thus:
"Moreover, by the phrase 'the modification of a penultimate vowel' what is meant is 'by the modification of some part". ${ }^{3}$

Thus, according to these commentators, the meaning of the term vikāra is 'change in some part'. Further, at RP II.5, the term vikāraśāstra occurs in the sense of 'the science of sandhi'.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 aññassa aññathābhāvo saññogassa ca ekatā/ saññogabhāvo cekassa vikāro ti pavuccuti // (Sadd 859)
    2 ädeso paṭhamāniddiṭtho ... vikāro dutiyāniddiṭtho / (Sadd 859)
    3 athāpy upadhāvikāra ity anena kvacid kasyacid avuyavasya vikāreneti / (Skanda and Maheśvara on the Nirukta, p. 8)
According to the view of the followers of Āpiśali, a grammatical operation in place of one phoneme is called vikāra and that in place of more than one letters is called an ädeśa. ${ }^{1}$ Thus, according to this view, there is a distinction between vikāra and ädeśa. Kavirāja, the author of the Kalāpacandra ascribes a similar view to Kulacandra. On Kt 2.3.33 he says:
"Here Kulacandra says: That which is substituted in place of more than one phoneme is called an ädeśa. That which is substituted in place of a single phoneme is called vikāra". ${ }^{2}$
The distinct nature of vikāra and ädeśa is reflected in a verse:
$\bar{a} g a m o$ 'nupaghātena vikāraś copamurdanāt /
$\bar{a} d e s ́ a s ~ t u ~ p r a s a n ́ g e n a ~ l o p a h ̣ ~ s a r v a ̄ p a k a r s a n ̣ a ̄ t ~ / / 3$
P uses only the term ädeśa in his Aṣt. Cf. e.g., eca ig hrasvādeśe (P 1.1.48), sthānivad ādeśo'nalvidhau (P 1.1.56). Ptj does not distinguish between vikāra and ädeśa as he says:
"Vikāra (modification) is called ädeśa (substitution)". 4

The word ädeśa occurs only once in Kt's rule: sphāyer $v \bar{a}$ ''deśah / (Kt 4.2.25)

# C. 

The above discussion shows that the distinction between vikāra and ädeśa started disappearing as early as at the time of Ptj. K and

1 ekavarnakāryam vikārah / Anekavarnakāryam ādeśa ity Āpiśalīyam matam / (K. C. Chatterji 1964:317)

2 atra kulucandrah: anekavarnasya sthāne yo vidhīyate, sa ādeśah / ekuvarnasya sthāne yo vidhīyate, sa vikāra iti /
3 Cf. Āgama, p. 139.
4 vikāra ādeśah / (Vol. I, p. 31, 11.17-18)
Agg distinguish between vikāra and ādesa. However, like P and C, they have preferred the term ädesa. Mogg has totally abandoned the term vikāra and has used ädesa throughout.

# 9. viparīta 

## A.

Viparīta is a peculiar term. Though it is common to both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammatical literature, it has different significations in these two traditions. Just as vipariyaya or viparyaya, viparīta is also derived from the root $\bar{\imath}$ with the prefixes $v i$ and pari meaning 'to go back'. In the philosophical context, it denotes 'reversed', 'changed'; 'equivocal'; 'wrong'. ${ }^{1}$

According to the Mmd 338, 35, viparīta is an older term for the phoneme $o$ :
viparīto nāma okārassa porāṇikā saññā /
Sadd 25: o vā viparīto ascribes the designation viparīta to the phoneme $o$ when it is a modification of the morpheme $a v a$, for example ovadati. ${ }^{2}$ Sadd 26: uvaṇno ca extends the term to the phoneme $u$ when it is a modification of the phoneme $o$ resulting from the morpheme ava. Thus, $o$ is a viparīta phoneme of ava and $u$ is a viparīta phoneme of $o$. According to Sadd 24, pubbaparādīni sandhikiriyopakarañāni, viparītatā denotes the modification of a consonant into a vowel or into another consonant, as well as the modification of a vowel into another vowel. ${ }^{3}$ This idea of viparītatā is very much similar to the idea of vikāra. Under Sadd 859, Agg has quoted two verses of his predecessors:
"Transformation of one phoneme into another, simplification of a consonant cluster and change of

1 A III.114, IV.226, V.284; Th 2, 393; Ja I. 334
2 atha vā okāro viparītasañño hoti avasaddassa viparītattā: ovadati /
3 vyañjanānaṃ sar-aññavyañjanattaṃ sarassa c aññasarattam viparītatā /
a single consonant into a conjunct is called $v i k a ̄ r a$. Change of a long vowel into a short one and so also the change of a short vowel into a long one, change of a single consonant into a conjunct, the simplification of a consonant cluster, change of a consonant into either a vowel or another consonant, change of a vowel into another vowel, is called viparītatā". ${ }^{1}$

The same is also reflected at Sadd 159: vuttānurakkhaṇatthaṃ viparītatā /
"In the gätha literature, the phenomenon of a phonetic change takes place to preserve the metrical length: Some teachers say 'the phenomenon of viparītatā (a phonetic change) is for preserving the metrical length and for following the rules regarding metrically long and short phonemes with regard to the gätha literature', whereas some other teachers say 'the phenomenon of vannavikāratā (a phonetic modification) is for preserving the metrical length of different types of compositions such as the gätha composition, the suttanta composition and the taranga composition". ${ }^{2}$

K uses viparīta in tabbiparītūpapade byañjane ca (Kacc 79), tesu vuddhilopāgamavikāraviparītādesā ca (Kacc 406) and kvaci dhātuvibhattippaccayānaṃ dīghaviparītādesalopāgamā ca (Kacc 519). Out of these, at Kacc 79 and 406, it denotes the phoneme $o<$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 aññassa aññathābhāvo saññogassa ca ekatā/ saññogabhāvo ca ekassa vikāro'ti pavuccati// rassabhāvo ca dīghassa atho rassassa dīghatā/ saññogabhāvo ca ekassa saññogassa ca ekatā// vyañjanānaṃ sarattaṃ ca aññavyañjanatā pi ca/ sarassa ca aññassaratā vuccate viparītatā //
    2 keci hi ācariyā "gāthāsu vuttianurakkhaṇatthāya garulahūnaṃ niyamassa pālanatthāya viparītatā"ti, keci pana "gāthāvatta-suttantavatta-tarangavattādīnaṃ vuttānam anurakkhaṇatthāya vannavikāratā hoti" ti vadanti/
ava and the phoneme $u<o$. At Kacc-Vu 406, we come across terms ādiviparīta, majjhaviparīta and uttaraviparīta. Here, uggate suriye and uggacchati are given as examples of ādiviparīta; samuggacchati, samuggate suriye as examples of majjhaviparīta and digu, digunnam as examples of uttaraviparīta. This shows that the term viparīta applies to any change of the phoneme $o$ to the phoneme $u$. At Kacc 519, viparīta is used in a more general nontechnical sense of change or modification.

Agg uses the term at Sadd 159: vuttānurakkhanattham viparītatā ca, 160: sutte sukhuccāranattham akkharalopo viparītatā ca, 859: tesu vuddhilopāgamavikāraviparītādesā ca and 1105: matantare kvaci dhātu-vibhatti-paccayānaṃ dīgha-viparīt'ādesa-lopāgamā ca. Out of these, its usage at Sadd 859 matches with that of Kacc 79 and 406, whereas in the remaining cases, the term denotes a phonetic change, just as Kacc 519. The term is, however, absent in the MV.

# B. 

In Sanskrit, the literal meaning of the term viparita is 'turned round, reversed, inverted' etc. However, as mentioned before, in Nir, the term viparīta is synonymous with viparyaya and denotes 'a metathesis'. Cf. Nir 5.4.8: tālu ... latater vā syāt viparī̄āt. In RP, it denotes change of $r$ into $i$ when preceded or followed by a palatal letter: anantare tadviparītam āhus tālavye śrnige bibhryād vicrttāh (RP 14.17). In Mbh, Ptj uses the term in its non-technical sense of 'in the opposite or reverse way'. Cf. viparītāc ceti vaktavyam / pārāvārīnah (Mbh on P 4.2.93, Vt. 2). The term is, however, missing in the grammars of P, C and Śarva.

## C.

Thus, as per the Pali grammatical tradition, the term viparīta conveys two meanings: 1 . the phonemes $u$ and $o$, from $o$ and $a v a$ respectively and 2. a phonetic modification in general. As shown by Agg, in the sense of a phonetic modification, the terms viparīta
and vikāra coincide with each other and the demarcating line between these two is vague. In Nir, viparita denotes metathesis. This meaning is, however, missing in the Pali grammars.
# Morphological Terminology 

## I. Terms Denoting the Basic Morphological Categories

In both, Sanskrit and Pali, every inflected word is analyzed into a stem and an affix. The stems are of two types: nominal and verbal. Suffixes on the other hand can be divided into nominal case endings, finite verbal endings, and primary and secondary derivative suffixes. Keeping this basic structure in mind, let us now study the terminology used by the Pali and the Sanskrit grammarians to denote these above-mentioned categories.

## 1. pada

## A.

In both, Pali and Sanskrit, the term pada denotes a word in general. ${ }^{1}$ However, in words parassapada (Skt. parasmaipada) and attanopada (Skt. ātmanepada) pada is used in the sense of suffixes. ${ }^{2}$ Besides this, in Pali it also denotes a verse (or a quarter of a verse), stanza, line, or a sentence. ${ }^{3}$

Among the Pali grammarians, Agg defines pada as:
vibhatyantam avibhatyantam vā atthajotakam padam/

1 ekena padena sabbo attho vutto / (S II.36)
2 Note that there are several occasions in the $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a k a p p a$ where Kacc-Vu uses pada in the sense of verbal endings. Cf. Kacc-Vu 410, 425-426, 428-430 etc.

3 A V.320, II.182, 189, III.356; Sn 252, 374; akkhuram padam vyañjanam (Nett 4). Cp. nāmādīhi parapadehi at Pj II 397, which is to be understood as nāma, pada and vyañjana, i.e. a word, a sentence, and a letter.
"The technical term pada denotes an inflected or an uninflected word expressing meaning". (Sadd 27)

In this case, it should be noted that Agg's inclusion of the term avibhatyantam in the rule is for the sake of bringing prefixes and particles within the scope of the pada designation.

Mogg has defined the term pada in the Vutti on apādādo padanekavākye (MV 2.234). The Vutti runs:
"The meaning is expressed by it. Thus it is called a pada, i.e. a word ending either in the nominal endings $s i$ etc. or the finite verbal endings $t i$ etc.". ${ }^{1}$

This is a recast of CVṛ 6.3.15:
padyate gamyate'nenārtha iti padam, subantam tiniantam ca/

The second part of the definition syādyantam tyādyantam $c a$ agrees with the Pāninian definition of pada (P 1.4.14).

K uses the term in the sense of an inflected form in the rule padato dutiyācatutthīchatthīsu vo no (Kacc 147) without defining it.

# B. 

Though the word pada occurs in the Sanskrit literature since the time of RV (1.22.5) in a variety of meanings, its first occurrence, as a technical term, can be traced back to the Go. Brā. ${ }^{2}$ BD defines pada as:
"A word (pada), the definition of which can be expressed, whether it be derived from two roots, many (roots), or one root, is one consisting of a sound (śabda) that contains root, preposition, members (avayava), and secondary elements

[^0]
[^0]:    1 pajjatenenattho ti padam, syādyantam tyādyantam ca /
    2 kati padāh / (Go. Brā. 1.1.24)
(guña). A word may be explained in five ways, (viz.) as derived from a root, as derived from the derivative of a root, as derived from a compounded meaning (samastārtha), as derived from a sentence ( $v \bar{a} k y a$ ), and as (of) ambiguous (derivation)". ${ }^{1}$
"From the sense (comes) the word (pada), its designation; from the word (comes) the ascertainment of the sense of the sentence ( $v \bar{a} k y a$ ). (For) the sentence arises from an aggregation of words, the word arises from an aggregation of letters". ${ }^{2}$

VP's definition of pada is: "Word is meaning". ${ }^{3}$
Among the Sanskrit grammarians, P has defined pada in four rules: suptiñantam padam (P 1.4.14), nah kye (P 1.4.15), siti ca (P 1.4.16), and svädiṣv asarvanāmasthāne (P 1.4.17). Out of these, P 1.4.14 ascribes the technical term pada to an inflected nominal or a verbal form:
"The technical term pada denotes a word ending either in the nominal endings denoted by the abbreviation sup or the finite verbal endings denoted by the abbreviation tiñ".

The remaining three rules, however, ascribe the same designation to a nominal stem in front of certain suffixes. According to P 1.4.15, a word form ending in the phoneme $n$ is called pada in front of the suffixes kyañ, kyac and kyas. As a result of assigning the pada designation to such word forms, we can get forms such as rājīyati, rājāyate, carmāyati, carmāyate etc. According to P

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dhātūpasargāvayavagunaśabdaṃ dvidhātujam / bahvekadhātujaṃ vā'pi padam nirvācyalakṣanam / dhātujaṃ dhātujāj jātaṃ samastārthajam eva vā // vākyajaṃ vyatikīrnaṃ ca nirvācyam pañcadhā padam // (BD 2.103, 104)
    2 arthāt padam svābhidheyyam padād vākyārthanirnayah / padasañghātajam vākyam varṇasañghātajam padam // (BD 2.117)
    3 arthah padam /(VP 3.2)
1.4.16, the same designation is ascribed to a stem before suffixes having an indicatory phoneme $s$, e.g., bhavadīyah, urnāyuh, $r t v i ̄ y a h$ etc. As per P 1.4.17, the pada designation is given to a nominal stem before the nominal and the taddhita suffixes beginning with consonants other than $y$ - except the suffixes termed as sarvanāmasthāna, ${ }^{1}$ e.g., rājabhyām, rājatā, rājatarah etc. This whole arrangement of giving the pada designation to nominal stems. in a particular situation is done by P in order to distinguish the strong, the middle and the weak suffixes. In Aṣt, the strong endings are named as sarvanāmasthāna. Though there is no special name given to the middle and the weak endings, a stem is called pada before the middle endings and $b h a^{2}$ before the weak endings. For instance, a nominal masculine stem rājan has forms rājānau, rājānah in case of the strong endings, rājabhyām, rājabhih in case of the middle endings and rājñah, rāj $\tilde{n} \bar{a}$ in case of the weak endings.

Sarva has defined pada in the rule:
pūrvāparayor arthopalabdhau padam / (Kt 1.1.20)
He combines the ancient definition: arthah padam with the more modern one: vibhaktyantam padam. DV explains:
"The technical term pada denotes a meaningful combination of a stem that precedes and the inflection that follows". ${ }^{3}$

Besides explaining these definitions, DT also mentions a more

1 P has defined the term sarvanāmasthāna in rules ši sarvanāmasthānam (P 1.1.42) and sut unapuṃsakasya (P 1.1.43). According to P 1.1.42, the term applies to the substitute $s i$ coming in place of the nominative and the accusative plural suffixes jas and śas. P 1.1.43 extends the term to the first five nominal case endings in the masculine and the feminine gender.
2 In the Aṣt, the technical term bha is ascribed to a nominal stem before an affix with an initial semivowel ( $y$-) or any vowel: yaci bham (P 1.4.18).
3 pūrvaparayoh prakrtivibhaktyor arthopalabdhau satyạṃ samudāyah padasaṃjño bhavati / (DV 1.1.20)
general explanation of pada:
"Pada is that by which the meaning is arrived at, i.e. expressed". ${ }^{1}$

Suṣeṇa, the author of the Kalāpacandra, while commenting on the same rule, records different views about the pada designation. He says:
"'Word is the meaning' say the followers of Indra. 'Pada denotes an inflected word' say the followers of Āpisali. 'Pada denotes a word ending in sup (the nominal case endings) or tin (the finite verbal case endings)' say the followers of Pānini. Here, in this treatise, Vararuci says that 'a word denotes a meaningful linguistic unit'". ${ }^{2}$

It is quite clear that the definitions of Āpisali and P are on an equal ground.

C uses pada in apādādau padād ekavākye (CV 6.3.15) without defining it.

# C. 

From the above discussion, it seems that initially the term pada was used to denote a linguistic unit capable of expressing a complete idea. Therefore, in literature, it is used either to denote a word or a sentence, a stanza or even a complete text. Following Sarva, the Pali grammarians have used pada only to denote an inflected word. On the other hand, P has ascribed this designation even to certain nominal stems.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 padyate gamyate'rtho'neneti padam / (DT 1.1.20)
    2 arthah padam āhur Aindrāh, vibhaktyantam padam āhur Āpisalīyāh, suptinantam padam Pāninīyāh, iha arthopalabdhau padam iti Vararucih /
# 2. linga / nāma / pātipadika / sadda 

## A.

## Linga

In Pali, the term linga generally means 'a sign, an attribute, a mark' (M I.360; S V.278; Sn 601). Besides this, the term also denotes a grammatical gender. ${ }^{1}$ In the Pali grammatical literature, it denotes an inflected / uninflected nominal base, and a grammatical gender.

Following Śarva, K and Agg use the term linga to signify an uninflected nominal stem. Cf. Kacc 434 and Sadd 905:
"The suffixes are added after a verbal or a nominal stem". ${ }^{2}$
"The suffixes are added after a verbal or a nominal stem or an immitative form". ${ }^{3}$

In this sense, the term linga agrees with the term prātipadika used by P. K has not given any formal definition of linga. At Kacc-Vn 286, linga is explained as:
"A hidden part is linga. Lina means 'concealed', (anga means) 'a part'. ... Here of the inflected forms puriso etc., the basic form purisa, which is without case endings, and partial, is concealed for being uninflected. It is also called anga on account of its being a part of the inflected form. By virtue of this, the basic uninflected form purisa, which is a part of an inflected word, is called linga. Or, linga is so called because it expresses / manifests the concealed meaning. Even by virtue of this, that

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Pj II 397; (-vipullāsa) Pv-a 7, 33, 58, 87, 157.
    2 dhātulingehi purāppaccayā /
    3 dhātulingānukaranehi paccayā /
basic form is called linga". ${ }^{1}$
At Sadd 196, Agg defines linga as:
dhätuppaccayavibhattivajjitam atthavam lingam /
"A meaningful linguistic unit leaving out the verbal roots, suffixes and the nominal and the verbal case endings is called linga (a nominal stem)."

This reflects the definition found at Kt 2.1.1 and P 1.2.45. Sadd 197: upasagganipāt $\bar{a}$ ca is, however, Agg's own initiative. This rule ascribes the technical term linga even to prefixes and particles. This implies that in view of Agg, the prefixes and particles are meaningless and therefore, it is necessary to make a special provision for them. In view of the Sanskrit grammarians like P and Sarva, prefixes and particles are meaningful linguistic elements and, therefore, are already within the scope of their existing definition of prātipadika and linga.

An additional definition of linga is given at Sadd 192:
visadatthādisahitam² līnatthagamakam nipphannavacanaṃ lingam /

According to this definition, the technical term linga denotes an inflected form, conveying concealed meaning along with the idea of masculine gender etc. In the commentary on the same rule, Agg has quoted a verse from Mmd 53, which throws light on this dual nature of the term linga:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 līnam angaṃ ti lingam, līnam ti apākatam avayavo ... ettha ca puriso ti ādīnam nipphannapadānam purisā ti vibhattirahitam avayavabhātam pakatirāpam anipphannattā apākatam, tassa nipphannapadassa avayavattā ca angaṃ / iminā nipphannapadassa avayavabhātam purisā ti vibhattirahitam pakatirāpameva lingam ti vuttam / līnam attham gamayati bodhetī ti vā lingam / iminā pi tam pakatirāpameva lingam ti vuttam /

    2 The term visadatthādi referrs to the idea of the grammatical gender, which is discussed by Agg in rules 193-195. For details, see below.
"The expression rukkho is called linga as the underlying meaning is conveyed by it. Thus, knowing what is linga (an inflected form) and what is the underlying meaning, wise should employ them". ${ }^{1}$

The difference between these two meanings of the word linga is also highlighted in the commentary on līnañgato $t \bar{a}^{2}$ :
"These said types of case endings are added after a linga meaning a stem form and not after the one meaning an inflected form". ${ }^{3}$

It should be noted that in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, the term linga is not used in the sense of 'an inflected nominal form'.

Linga in the sense of either an inflected or an uninflected nominal base is missing in MV where, it only signifies a grammatical gender. Cf. MVu 2.61, 113, 209; 5.49.

# Nāma 

The literal meaning of nāma is 'name'. In Pali grammars, it is used in the sense of an inflected / uninflected nominal stem.

K and Agg have used nāma in the sense of 'an inflected nominal'. ${ }^{4}$ However, at Kacc 603: taddhitasamāsakitakā nāmam $v \bar{a}$ tavetūnādisu ca, K has used nāma in the sense of a nominal stem. Mogg has used nāma in the sense of 'an uninflected nominal

1 rukkho ti vacanam lingam, lingattho tena dipito / evam lingam ca lingattham ñatvä yojeyya pandito //
2 "They are added after a nominal stem". (Sadd 202)
3 tā vibhattiyo vuttappakārā līnañgabhātusmā lingato parā honti, na nipphannalingamhā/
4 Kacc 318: nāmānam samāso yuttattho; Sadd 163: kvaci sare vyañjane vā oduntānam nāmānam akārantattam pakati; Sadd 199: syāduyo nāme, tyāduyo ākhyāte; Sadd 415: samāsagatanāme kvaci /
stem'. ${ }^{1}$ In his opinion, here nāma is equivalent to pātipadika (Skt. prātipadika):
nāmaṃ pātipadikam ... (MVu 1.9)
Here it should be noted that the term pātipadika in the sense of 'an uninflected nominal stem' also occurs in Kacc-Vu, Sadd and MVu. Cf. paṭakala ... iccevam ādīhi dhātūhi pātipadikehi ca uttarapadesu alappaccayo hoti (Kacc-Vu 667); masu icc etassa pātipadikassa ... (Sadd 1239); and keci panāhu asattavacane hetehi pātipadikatthe dutiyā tatiyā pañcamī suttamiyo (MVu 2.28). Agg extends the term pātipadika to inflected and uninflected nouns:
"A pātipadika is also twofold: inflected and uninflected". ${ }^{2}$

Besides the more established linga, nāma and pātipadika, K and Agg have used a more general term sadda, meaning 'a word' to refer to an uninflected nominal base (Kacc 177, 185; Sadd 155, $363,498,527)$.

# B. 

In the Go. Brā. (1.1.24), we come across the questions:
ko dhātuh, kiṃ prātipadikam, kiṃ nāmākhyātam /
Here it should be noted that nāman and prātipadika were in use side by side since the time of the Go. Brā. Between these two, P has favoured the term prātipadika whereas Siddhahemaśabdānuśāsana, Śabdānuśāsana and Sār have used the term nāman.
K. C. Chatterji (1964: 68) has suggested that the word prātipadika is derived from the word pratipada (every word) with

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dve dve kānekesu nāmasmā si yo am yo nā hi sa nam smā hi sa nam smim su / (MV 2.1)
    2 duvidho hi pātipadiko: nipphanno ca unipphanno ca/
the suffix thak in the sense of 'prayojana'. Thus, according to him, prātipadika means 'that which is necessary for each inflected word'.

P uses this term to denote a nominal stem. His definition of prātipadika is:
arthavad adhātur apratyayah prātipadikam, krttaddhitasumāsāś ca / (P 1.2.45-46)
"That which conveys the sense and is neither a root nor a suffix (nor a word ending in a suffix) is a prātipadika. Compounds as well as words ending in primary and secondary suffixes are also called prātipadikas".

Śarva uses linga for prātipadika. In Upaniṣads, linga denotes 'a characteristic', then it came to signify 'a gender' and later, to denote 'the substance having that gender'. Kt 2.1.1 defines linga as:
dhātuvihuktivarjam arthaval lingam /
"A meaningful linguistic unit leaving out the verbal root, the nominal and the verbal case endings is a prātipadika".

Trilocanadāsa, the author of the KVP, says under Kt 2.1.1:
"This is a self-explanatory term. It is called linga as the meaning is indicated, marked i.e. partially conveyed by it. It is said to be the cause of vague understanding". ${ }^{1}$

CVṛ 2.1.1 uses śabda to denote a nominal base. ${ }^{2}$

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have used four different words such as linga, nāma, pātipadika and sadda to denote an uninflected nominal stem. K and Agg seem to have borrowed the term linga from Sarva. Agg has shown that in the Pali tradition, the terms linga and pātipadika are also used to denote an inflected nominal form. This usage is, however, unparalleled in the Sanskrit grammar. It is difficult to provide a satisfactory answer to why Mogg has chosen the term nāma to denote a nominal stem.

## 3. dhātu

## A.

In Pali, the literal meaning of the word dhātu is 'a primary element' (D I.215; S I. 15 etc.). In the grammatical context, it signifies a verbal root. In this sense, it has no canonical status. Dhātu in the sense of a verbal root is used at Kacc 274, 434, 440; Sadd 196, 233, 558; MV 4.142, 5.12.

K and Agg define dhātu as: bhūvādayo dhātavo /
"The technical term dhātu denotes a group of words bhū etc."1 (Kacc 459, Sadd 938).
Rüp 408 provides an alternative explanation of this definition:
bhūvä ādi pakārā yesaṃ te bhūvādayo /
According to this definition, the term dhātu denotes verbal roots of the type of the root $b h \bar{u}$ or $v \bar{a}$.

The term dhātu is analysed as:
"Dhātu is that which bears the meaning". ${ }^{2}$
However, according to Rüp 408:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhū iccevamādayo ye saddagaṇā te dhātusaññā honti / (Kacc-Vu 459)
    2 uttham dhāretī ti dhātu / (Kacc-Vṇ 526)
"Bh $\bar{a}$ etc. and those ending in the verbal derivative suffixes kha etc. are called dhātus for they bear the action". ${ }^{1}$

By virtue of this explanation, the scope of the term dhātu is extended even to those secondary verbal roots ending in the suffixes kha etc. ${ }^{2}$. This is also supported by the rule: dhātuppaccayehi vibhattiyo / (Kacc 457, Sadd 936)
"The verbal case endings are added after verbal affixes starting from $k h a$ up to the causal affixes". ${ }^{3}$

Note that Mogg uses dhātu at MV 4.142: adhātussa kessyādito ghe ssi and 5.12: dhātvatthe nāmasmi. MVu uses nāmadhātu to express denominatives. Cf. MVu 4.69: dhūmāyitattanti - ktānt $\bar{a}$ nāmadhātuto ttena siddham. Besides dhātu, Mogg uses the term kiriyattha (having the sense of an action) to express the verbal roots at MV 3.14: ci kriyatthehi and 5.14: kriyatth $\bar{a} .{ }^{4}$ Here it should be noted that C also uses the term kriyārtha for dhātu.

# B. 

Dhātu in the sense of 'essential ingredients of words' occurs for the first time in the Go. Brā. (1.1.24):

Oṃkāraṃ pṛcchāmah ko dhātuh ... /
At Nir 1.20, it is rightly derived from the root $d h \bar{a}$ :
"Dhātuh (root) is derived from (the root) $d h \bar{a}$ (to put)". ${ }^{5}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 kiriyaṃ dhārentī ti dhātavo, bhūvādayo, khādidhātuppacayantā ca /
    2 kha etc. include suffixes cha, sa, aya, iya, ne, ṇaya, nāpe, nāpaya, ṇaya which are taught in the second kanda of the third chapter of the Kacc.
    3 dhātuniddiṭthehi paccayehi khādikāritantehi vibhattiyo honti / (Kacc-Vu 457, Sadd 936)
    4 kriyā attho yassa so kriyattho dhātu / (MVu 5.14)
    5 dhātur dadhāteh/
The term dhātu is used by P and is retained in the most systems of grammar. Commenting on the term dhātu, the Kāsikā says:
"The word dhātu is a name given by the earlier teachers. They designated the action words. Therefore, here too, by resorting to the name given by the earlier teachers, the name dhātu is given to those (words) which denote an action". ${ }^{1}$

P does not provide any descriptive definition of dhātu. His rule: bhūvādayo dhātavah (P 1.3.1) simply says:
"(The technical term) dhātu 'a verbal base or a stem or a root' denotes the class of words whose first member is $b h \bar{u}$ ".

P 3.1.32: sanādyuntā dhātavah extends the dhātu designation to the words ending in the suffixes san etc. Explaining the term dhātu, Kātyāyana says:
"Dhātu is a term denoting an action". ${ }^{2}$
Śarva defines dhātu as: kriyābhāvo dhātuh (Kt 3.1.9). Commentators explain the rule thus:
"The term which reveals or expresses the action is called dhātu". ${ }^{3}$ (DT 3.1.9)

This agrees with Kātyāyana's definition. Like P, Śarva also extends the dhātu designation to the words ending in suffixes san etc. Cf. Kt 3.2.16: te dhātavah /

C generally uses kriyārtha for dhātu. Cf. CV 1.1.40: ekāco halādeh kriyārthād bhṛsābhīkṣ̣̣ye yan which corresponds to P

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dhātuśabdah pūrvācāryasaṃjñā / te ca kriyāvacanānāṃ saṃjñāṃ krtavantaḥ / tad ihāpi pūrvācāryasaṃjñāśrayanāt kriyāvācinām eva bhūvādīnāṃ dhātusaṃjñā vidhīyate /
    2 kriyāvacuno dhātuh / (1.3.1)
    3 yah śabdah kriyām bhāvayati pratipādayati sa dhātusaṃjño bhavati /
3.1.22: dhātor ekāco halādeh kriyāsamabhihāre yañ. However, at CV 1.3.119, the term dhātu is also used: dhātäktāv ayadi vā.

Both, the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammarians classify dhātus into sakammaka (Skt. sakarmaka) and akammaka (Skt. akarmaka). In this connection, the Rüp says:
"Further, they (dhātus) are twofold according to the meaning: transitive (sakammaka) and intransitive (akammaka). In this regard, the transitive roots are the roots denoting an action, which requires an object, for instance, katam karoti (someone prepares a mat), gämaṃ gacchati (someone goes to the village) etc. The intransitive roots are the roots denoting an action which does not require an object, for instance, seti (someone sleeps), tiṭthati (someone stands) etc.". ${ }^{1}$

Also cp. MVu 5.17:
"Transitive verbal roots are those whose action requires an object but those whose action requires only an agent are called intransitive verbal roots". ${ }^{2}$

At P 1.3.53: udaścarah sakarmakāt, P uses sakarmaka for the transitive roots and at P 3.4.69: lah karmaṇi ca bhāve cākarmakebhyaḥ he uses akarmaka for intransitive roots. C uses sāpya for sakarmaka (CV 1.4.106) and anāpya for akarmaka (CV $1.2 .97,1.4 .91)$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 te pana atthavasā dvidhā bhavanti - sakammakā, akammakā cā ti / tatra sakammakā - ye dhātavo kammāpekkham kriyaṃ vadanti, yathā - katam karoti, gāmaṃ gacchati ādayo; akammakā - ye kummanirapekkham kriyaṃ vadanti, yathā - seti, tiṭthutī ti ādayo / (Rüp 408)
    2 yassa pana dhātussa kriyā kammam apekkhate so sakammako; yassa tu kriyā kattumattum apekkhate svākammakoti ñātabbam /
# C. 

Thus, the term dhātu in the sense of a verbal root is common to all the grammars. Kiriyattha / kriyārtha, which are selfexplanatory, are only used by Mogg and C. Though Mogg has followed C in this regard, he has not adopted C's terms sāpya and anāpya to denote the transitive and the intransitive roots respectively. He has rather favoured the more established terms sakammaka and akammaka.

## 4. paccaya

## A.

In Pali, the word paccaya denotes 'resting on, falling back on; support, requisite' (Sn 339, Mil 336 etc.). Paccaya in the sense of 'a suffix' is a clear instance of a borrowing from Sanskrit. In this sense, it only occurs in the grammatical context.

All the Pali grammarians have used the term paccaya in the sense of 'a suffix', without defining it (Kacc 237, 405; Sadd 196, 236; MV 3.68, 4.120). The only information available about suffixes is that they always follow the verbal or the nominal roots. ${ }^{1}$ Cf. dhātulingehi parāppaccayā (Kacc 434); and dhātulingānukaraṇehi paccayā (Sadd 905). According to Kacc-Vṇ 434, the term paccaya here denotes the nominal case endings si etc. and the verbal case endings $t i$ etc. ${ }^{2}$ In Kacc-Vṇ on Kacc 83: saralopomādesa-ppaccayādimhi saralope tu pakati, paccaya is used in the sense of primary and secondary affixes and the finite verbal endings. ${ }^{3}$ At Kacc 237: itthiyamato appaccayo, it denotes a feminine suffix. At Kacc 457: dhātuppaccayehi vibhattiyo, it

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Note that Mogg and C take it for granted and do not make any special statement in this regard.

    2 ettha ca paccayaggahanena syādināmavibhattiyo ca tyādiākhyātavibhattiyo ca sangaṇhanti /
    3 paccayaggahanena taddhitākhyātakitakapaccayā gahitā/
denotes suffixes taught in connection with the verbal roots such as the causal suffixes and the suffixes kha etc. ${ }^{1}$. At Kacc 405: kvacādimajjhuttarānaṃ dīgharassā paccayesu ca, it also denotes the secondary derivative suffixes. The term denotes any type of affix, which is added after a nominal or a verbal base.

# B. 

In Sanskrit, pratyaya is derived from prati $+i$ 'to go towards or against' and means 'that which follows'. It is used in the Prātisāāhyas and their commentaries in the sense of 'a subsequent word or sound'. In VP, the word is used both in the sense of 'following' and in the sense of 'a suffix'. Thus, in pratyayasavarnam mudi Śākatāyanah ${ }^{2}$ (3.9) pratyayasavarna is used in the sense of parasavarna. (Chatterji 1964: 91)

In the Go. Brā., pratyaya appears to be used in the sense of a case ending:
ko dhātuh kah pratyayah ... (Go. Brā. 1.1.24)
Although the term pratyaya is absent in the Nir, Y uses other terms like nāmakarana ${ }^{3}$ and upabandha ${ }^{4}$ to refer to a suffix.

Pratyayah (P 3.1.1) states that the technical term pratyaya applies to whatever is taught in the subsequent rules up to the end of the chapter five. P 3.1.2: paraś ca adds that these suffixes are added after an element (a verbal or a nominal stem). The suffix bahuc is a sole exception to this rule as it is added before a

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dhātuniddiṭhehi paccayehi khādikāritantehi vibhattiyo honti / (Kacc-Vu 457)
    2 "Śākaṭāyana prescribes the change of a visurjanīya into the homogeneous letter of the following sound when a sibilant follows".

    3 Avater gatyarthasya aso nāmakaranah "asa is a primary suffix added to the root $a v$ which has the sense of motion". (Nir 1.17)

    4 adhvaryuḥ ... api vādhīyāne yur upabandhah "adhvaryuḥ ... or (the word is formed) by the addition of (the suffix) yuh (to the word adhvar) in the sense of studying". (Nir 1.8)
nominal stem. Cf. P 5.3.68. According to P 3.1.3: ādyudāttaś ca,
"The affix which follows (the verbal or the nominal stem) is accented on its initial syllable".

Śarva follows P. Cf. pratyayah parah / (Kt 3.2.1)
C generally avoids the use of the term pratyaya. $\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{r}}$ simply uses parah in the place of pratyaya. Cf. for instance, tijah kṣamāyāṃ vartamānāt san paro bhavati / (CVr 1.1.17)

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have borrowed the term paccaya from their Sanskrit counterparts.

## II. Terminology Denoting Inflectional Classes of Nominals

The Pali grammarians have used four algebraic terms to , represent four inflectional classes of nominatives. They are jha, la, $p a$, and gha. Out of these, jha denotes the phonemes $i$, and $\bar{i}$ coming at the end of the masculine and the neuter stems, la denotes the phonemes $u$ and $\bar{u}$ coming at the end of the masculine and the neuter stems. ${ }^{1} \mathrm{~Pa}$ denotes the phonemes $i, \bar{i}, u$, and $\bar{u}$ coming at the end of the feminine stems. ${ }^{2}$ However, the term nad $\bar{i}$ is also used by K and Agg to denote the $\bar{i}$-ending and the $\bar{u}$-ending feminine stems. Agg defines nadī at Sadd 724 as: thiyam ikārukārā nadī/
"The technical term nadī applies to the phonemes $\bar{i}$ and $\bar{u}$ coming at the end of the feminine stems".

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ivannuvannäjjhalā (Kacc 58), jhal' ivann-uvarnnā (Sadd 205), iyuvannā jhalā nāmassante (MV 1.9).
    2 te itthikhyā po (Kacc 59), itthiyan te po (Sadd 206), pitthiyam (MV 1.10).
Commenting on the term nadī, Rūp says that the term nad $\bar{\imath}$ is a borrowed term denoting phonemes $\bar{\imath}$ and $\bar{u}$ of a feminine stem. ${ }^{1} \mathrm{Cp}$. P 1.4.3: yū stryākhau nadī and Kt 2.1.9: idūt stryākhau nadī. Agg uses this term in a lone rule Sadd 725: nadīto ko. K uses the term only once at Kacc 340: nadīmh $\bar{a}$ ca, without defining it. It is noteworthy that Mogg teaches the same grammatical operation without coining a new technical term. Cf. e.g.,
"An affix $k a$ is mostly added after a bahubbīhi compound ending either in the suffix ltu or in feminine $i$ or $u^{"} .^{2}$

Gha stands for the phoneme $\bar{a}$ coming at the end of the feminine stems. ${ }^{3}$ In this regard, it is noteworthy that just as Sarva, the Pali grammarians also ascribe these terms to the phoneme and not to the stem. These terms are without parallel in the Sanskrit grammars. According to K. C. Chatterji (1964: 63),
"Jha and la were probably suggested by P's rule iko jhal (P 1.2.9), gha by P's ghi and pa by P's nīp".

This, however, is just a probability and there is no strong reason to support it.

# B. 

In ancient Sanskrit grammars and the grammatical literature, we find a tendency to use a particular word to represent a particular inflectional class of nominals. Such terms are referred to as nāyaka in the Agnipurāna. According to this method, agni represents the stems ending in $i$ and $u$, nad $\bar{\imath}$ represents the feminine stems ending in $\bar{\imath}$ and $\bar{u}$, and s̃raddh $\bar{a}$ represents the feminine stems ending in $\bar{a}$. All these terms occur in Kt , which generally retains the older

[^0]
[^0]:    1 nadīti cettha itthivācakānam ikārukārānam parasamaññā / (Rūp 341)
    2 latvitthiyūhi ko; Itupaccayante hi itthimikārūkārantehi ca bahulam kappaccayo hoti aññapadatthe / (MV, MVu 3.52)
    3 ā gho (Kacc 60), ākāro gho (Sadd 207), ghā (MV 1.11).
terms: idud agnih, idūt stryākhyau nadī, $\bar{a}$ śraddhā (Kt 2.1.8-10). P has accepted nad $\bar{i}^{1}$ but has used ghi ${ }^{2}$ instead of agni. In his system, there is no term to denote the feminine stems ending in $\bar{a}$. These stems are referred to by mentioning the suffix $\bar{a} p$, which has the merit of being monosyllabic. Inspite of this similarity, these two grammars differ on what these terms denote. In P's system, the technical terms nad $\bar{i}$ and ghi are ascribed to stems whereas in the Kt , they are ascribed to the phonemes. Cp. for instance, the Kāśikā on P 1.4.3:
"The technical term nad $\bar{i}$ applies to the feminine word forms ending in phonemes $\bar{i}$ or $\bar{u}^{"}{ }^{3}$

DT on the other hand remarks:
"The technical term agni only applies to the phonemes $i$ and $u^{"}{ }^{4}$

Commenting on this, KVP says:
"By this statement, it is shown that the technical term agni only applies to these phonemes and not to the words ending in these phonemes". ${ }^{5}$

C uses $\dot{n} y \bar{u} \dot{n}$ (6.2.46: $\dot{n} y \bar{u} \dot{n} a h$ ) for nad $\bar{\imath}$ and idut (6.2.48: idutor eñ) for ghi.

# C. 

From the above discussion, it is quite clear that in case of the technical terms used for denoting inflectional classes of nominals, the Pali grammarians have adopted a totally different line from the

1 yū stryākhyau nadī / (P 1.4.3)
2 śeso ghy asakhi / (P 1.4.7)
3 ikārāntam ūkārāntam ca stryākhyam śabdarūpam nadīsamjñam bhavati /
4 ikāramātra ukāramātraś ca agnir iti / (DT 2.1.8)
5 etena ata āha - ikāra ukāraś ceti / kevalayor evānayor agnisumjñā syāt, na tadantasyeti darśitam / (KVP 2.1.8)
Sanskrit grammarians. Nadi is the only term, which the Pali grammarians have borrowed from their Sanskrit counterpart. Like Sarva, the Pali grammarians have ascribed these technical terms to the final phoneme of a stem unlike P who ascribes the terms to the entire stem.

# III. Terms Denoting Nominal and Verbal Inflections 

## 1. vibhatti

## A.

The term vibhatti (Skt. vibhakti) is derived from $v i+b h a j$ 'to divide, distribute' and means 'division, distinction, classification, detail, variety'. ${ }^{1}$ As a technical term of grammar denoting inflection of nouns and verbs, declensions, and conjugations, it occurs at Pj II 397; Vv-a 78, 199. The term vibhattilopa occurs at Vv-a 174, 192; Pv-a 147.

Agg defines the term vibhatti as:
kammādivasena ekattādivasena ca vividhā bhājiyantī ti vibhattiyo / (Sadd 198)
"Vibhattis are so called as they are divided in many ways by way of kamma (an object) etc. and ekatta etc. (singularity)."

However, in Padamālā 15,4, Agg's statement "Or: it distributes / divides the syntactic relations kamma etc. by way of singular and plural. Thus, it is called vibhatti" ${ }^{2}$ presents the grammatical cases as distributors of kārakas. Kacc-Vn 54 runs on the same lines. It says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Ja VI.432, Nett I sq., 105, Mil 102, 381, Vism 352, Pv-a 199, 282
    2 kummādayo vā kārake ekuvacanabahuvacanavasena vibhajatī ti vibhatti/
"Vibhattis (case endings) are so called because they divide / distribute the meaning of a noun by way of syntactic relations kamma (object) etc. and singularity etc. Or, the meaning of a nominal stem is divided by it. Thus, they are vibhattis (case endings)". ${ }^{1}$

Mogg also relates the term vibhatti with the idea of division, as he says:
etāni satta dukāni sattavibhattiyo; vibhāgo vibhattīti katvā / (MV 2.1)
"These seven pairs are called the seven cases as the term vibhatti denotes division."

This has a striking similarity with CVr 2.1.1. (See below)
According to Agg, the main function of case endings is to manifest the number and gender: samkhälingatthāvikaranattham uppatti vibhattīnam / (Sadd 663)

Among the Pali grammarians, Mogg has used the term vibhatti to denote the nominal case endings si etc. He is, however, silent about whether the finite verbal endings are to be called vibhattis or not. K and Agg, on the other hand, have clearly mentioned that in their grammars, the term vibhatti denotes both the nominal (sy $\bar{a} d \bar{i}$ ) and the verbal (ty $\bar{a} d \bar{i}$ ) suffixes. ${ }^{2}$ Note that at Kacc-Vn 434, the terms nāmavibhatti and $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a v i b h a t t i$ are used for the nominal and the verbal endings. ${ }^{3}$ They have further extended the vibhatti designation to the suffixes to, tra, tha, dhi, va, him, ham,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 kammādivasena ca ekattādivasena ca lingattham vibhajantī ti vibhattiyo; atha vā vibhajjate pātipadikattho etāyā ti vibhattiyo /

    2 tato ca vibhattiyo (Kacc 54), dhātuppaccayehi vibhattiyo (Kacc 457); syādayo tyādayo ca vibhattiyo / (Sadd 198)
    3 ettha ca paccayaggahanena syādināmavibhattiyo ca tyādiākhyātavibhattiyo ca sanganhanti/
hiñcanam, ha, dhā, dā, dācanam, dāni, rahi, dhunā. ${ }^{1}$ These suffixes are used in the sense of a particular case or time. Mogg, however, does not treat these suffixes as vibhattis.

# B. 

As per the Sanskrit tradition, the term vibhakti in the sense of a case ending probably occurred for the first time in the Go. Brā. ${ }^{2}$. Nyāsa explains the term as follows:
"The term vibhakti denotes nominal case endings denoted by the abbreviation sup or the division, i.e. the division of the syntactic capacities, for the meaning of a nominal stem (prātipadika) is divided by it". ${ }^{3}$

P has ascribed the vibhakti designation to the nominal and the verbal case endings sup and tin̄: vibhaktis ca / (P 1.4.104)

Śarva uses the term vibhakti at Kt 2.1.2 without defining it: tasmāt parā vibhaktayah. Commenting on the rule, DV says:
"The nominal case endings si etc. are added after a nominal stem. ... They are called vibhaktis as the meaning is divided by them". ${ }^{4}$

In the Kt , the tenses and moods are also called vibhaktis. Cf. DV on Kt 3.1.11: samprati kāle vartamānā vibhaktir bhavati /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tvādayo vibhattisaññāyo "The suffixes to etc. are designated as vibhatti" (Kacc 249); tvādayo ekabahvatthesu vibhattisañña "The suffixes to etc. in the sense of a singular or a plural are designated as vibhatti". (Sadd 492)
    2 kā vibhaktih / (Go. Brā. 1.1.24)
    3 vibhaktiśabdah supạ̣̄ vācakah / vibhāgavacuno vā / kārakaśaktivibhāgah / vibhajyate prātipadikārtho'nayeti krtvā / (Nyāsa 1.2.44)
    4 tasmāt lingāt parāh syādayo vibhaktayo bhavanti ... arthasya vibhajanād vibhaktayah /
P and Śarva have also extended the term vibhakti to denote the taddhita suffixes tas, tra, ha, dhā, rhi, adhunā, dānīm, thā, tham, astāt, atas, etc., which practically serve the purpose of vibhaktis. ${ }^{1}$

In C's grammar, the term vibhakti is used at CVr 2.1.1:
tāny etāni sapta trayāni sapta vibhaktayo bhavanti, vibhāgo vibhaktir iti krtvā /
"These seven triads are called the seven cases as the term vibhakti denotes division".

# C. 

Among the Pali grammarians, K and Agg's usage of the term vibhatti matches with that of Śarva and P. In this respect, Mogg has followed C.

## 2. vacana (Number)

A.

The literal meaning of the term vacana is 'word, expression'. In Pali, it denotes 'saying, utterance' (S II.18, A II.168, Sn 417). Besides this, in compounds, as a second member, it denotes an expression / case endings, e.g., paccattavacana (expression of nominative or nominative case) (Pj II 303), vattamānavacana (expression of present tense or present tense) (Pj II 16, 23), sampadānavacana (expression of dative or dative case) (Pj II 317) etc. Note that in MVu and Sadd, vacana is used to denote a suffix. Cf. sabbādito nam vacanassa sam sānam honti; akārantato

[^0]
[^0]:    1 prāgdiśo vibhaktih / (P 5.3.1)
    vibhaktisamjñā vijñeyā vaksyante'tah parum tu ye /
    advyādeh sarvanämnas te bahos caiva parāh smrtāh // (Kt 2.6.24)
    "Those stated hereafter are to be known as vibhaktis. They are added after bahu and the pronouns other than $d v i$ etc.".
parassa nāvacanassa enādeso hoti (MVu 2.102, 2.110); gosuddato naṃvacanassa amādeso hoti (Sadd 227). In MVu 6.13 (māyoge $\bar{\imath}$-$\bar{a}$-ādi), dvivacana is used in the sense of duplication: lunāhi lunāhitvevāyaṃ lunāhi, lunussu lunussu-tvevāyaṃ lunātīti ādīnamevetam majjhimapurisekavacanānam ābhikkhaññe dvivacanam. At Pj II 397, vacana is combined with linga and other terms and denotes 'number' i.e. singular and plural. Note that at Sadd 672: lingavibhattivacanakālapuris'-akkharānaṃ vipallāso, vacana is used as a generic term denoting 'a grammatical number'. The term bahuvacana in the sense of a plural number occurs at Ja IV. 173 and Pv-a 163. It is reasonable to suppose that vacana as a technical term was used with eka and bahu and then separated from these and was used as a generic term.

K and Agg have consistently used ekavacana to denote the singular and bahuvacana to denote the plural. Cf. e.g., saṃsāsvekavacanesu ca (Kacc 62), temekavacane (Kacc 148); na dutiyekavacane (Sadd 327), saṃsāsv ekavacanesu thiyam (Sadd 209); bahuvacanesu vo no (Kacc 151), vo no bahuvacane (Sadd 329).

Mogg on the other hand uses eka and aneka for the same. Cf. MV 6.14: pubbaparachakkānamekānekesu tumhāmhasesesu dve dve majjhimuttamapaṭhamā, MV 2.47: ghapatekasmiṃ nādīnaṃ yayā.

Note that the Pali grammarians sometimes also use the shorter forms ekattam for ekavacana ${ }^{1}$ and bahu for bahuvacana. ${ }^{2}$ At Sadd 482: bhante bhadde ti ekaputhuvacanantam avyayam, Agg uses the term puthuvacana for bahuvacana.

At Sadd 201, Agg defines ekavacana and bahuvacana as:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 digussekattam (Kacc 323); ekattam digussa (Sadd 699); kvacekattañca chatthiyā / (MV 3.22)
    2 bahusu vā / (MV 2.243)
dvīsu dvīsu paṭhamam pathamam ekavacanam, pacchimam pacchimam bahuvacanam /
"In each pair, the preceding is called ekavacana (singular) and the following is called bahuvacana (plural)".

# B. 

Ekavacana and bahuvacana are found first in the ŚB:
ned ekavacanena bahuvacanaṃ vyavayāma / 1 (13.5.1.18)

The term dvivacana is not found before the time of Y :
Api vā medasaś ca paśoś ca / sāttvaṃ dvivacanaṃ syāt / yatra hy ekavacanārthah prasiddham tad bhavati $/^{2}$ (Nir 6.16)
Ekavat, dvivat and bahuvat occur in BD 4.107, in the sense of 'in the singular, in the dual and in the plural':
"In that (hymn), there appear statements (pravādah) in the dual, plural, and singular". ${ }^{3}$
RP 1.71 has dvivacah for dvivacana. The generic term vacana occurs in BD 1.43: bhede vacanalingayoh $/ 4$

P follows his predecessors and uses ekavacana, dvivacana, and bahuvacana:
tāny ekavacanadvivacanabahuvacanāny ekaśah /
"Those (= three and three triplets of tin $)$ taken one
by one have the (technical term) ekavacana

1 "Lest we should over-ride the plural by the singular".
2 "Or else it may be in the dual number. It is well known when it is in the singular".
3 pravādas tatra drśsyate dvivad bahuvad ekavat/
4 "When there is a distinction of number and gender".
'singular', dvivacana 'dual' and bahuvacana 'plural'". (P 1.4.102)

He also uses the generic term vacana at P 2.3.46: prātipadikārtha-liñga-parimāna-vacana-mātre prathamā /

Śarva uses ekavacana in rules:
kriyāsamabhihāre sarvakālesu madhyamaikavacanam pañcamyāh / (Kt 3.1.21)
ij ātmane padeh prathamaikavacane / (Kt 3.2.29)
He has used dvivacana and bahuvacana in the first chapter in rules: dvivacanam anau and bahuvacanam ami ( Kt 1.3.2-3) but in the subsequent chapters he has generally used ekatva, dvitva and bahutva. Cf. vāṃ nau dvitve, tvanmador ekatve te me (Kt 2.3.2-3) etc. Dvivācin is used once in yuvāvau dvivācisu (Kt 2.3.7). In Kt. 4.2.88: brūva id vacanādih, vacana appears to have been used in the sense of verbal endings.

C uses ekavacana, dvivacana and bahuvacana: ekavacanasya te me (CV 6.3.18), id-ud-ed dvivacanam (CV 5.1.125) and bahuvacanasya vasnasau (CV 6.3.17). Sometimes he uses shorter terms such as eka etc.: tvamau ekasmin (CV 5.4.63).

# C. 

In Pali, the terms ekavacana and bahuvacana are used since the time of the Atṭhakathā literature. Later, these terms are also used by all the three Pali grammarians. In this regard, the Pali grammarians are comparatively more close to P and C than Śarva.

## 3. Case Terminology

## A.

As mentioned before, the nominal and the verbal case endings are called vibhatti (Skt. vibhakti). Out of these, the nominal case
endings are further subdivided into seven groups, which are called the nominal cases.

The authors of the Pali Aṭthakathās have resorted to a totally different case terminology than the one adopted by the Pali grammarians. In Pali as well as in Sanskrit grammars, the seven cases are referred to by their numbers. The case terminology used in the Atṭhakathās is shown in the following table with their equivalents found in Pali and Sanskrit grammars:

| Atṭhakathās | Pali <br> grammars | Sanskrit <br> grammars | English <br> Equivalents |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Paccattavacana ${ }^{1}$ | Paṭhamāa ${ }^{2}$ | Prathamāa ${ }^{3}$ | Nominative |

| Bhummavacana ${ }^{7}$ | Sattamī ${ }^{8}$ | Saptamī ${ }^{9}$ | Locative |

Apart from these seven cases, there is the eighth case called the vocative. In later grammars, there is no special name given to this case. However, from the reference found in Agg's Sadd (Padamālā, 60), we know that the older name of this case was atthamī. Cf.:
idam ettha niruttilakkhanaṁ datthabbam paccattavacane pathamā vibhatti, upayogavacane dutiyā vibhatti bhavati, karanavacane tatiyā bhavati, sampadānavacane catutthī vibhatti bhavati, nissakkavacane pañcamī ... sāmivacane chattthī ... bhummavacane sattamī ... āmantanavacane atthamī vibhatti / Tatra uddānam paccattam upayogañ ca karanaṁ sampadānīyam /

# B. 

Note that the same practice is already met with in the early Sanskrit tradition. K. C. Chatterji (1964: 388) informs us that Y and P do not consider the vocative as a separate vibhakti. However, the older works such as BD distinctly speak of eight vibhaktis: aṣtau yatra prayujyante nānārtheṣu vibhaktayah. ${ }^{2}$ From the following passage of the Mbh (II.421), it will be clear that in ancient works on grammar, the vocative was placed after the locative:
citrā yasya gāvaś citragus tiṣthati ... citrā yasya gāvaś citragau nidhehi / citrā yasya gāvo he citrago iti /

## ālapana / āmantana

## A.

The vocative requires special attention because of its unique position. Both the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammarians have used a separate name for the vocative different than the nominative.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "Here, this should be understood as a rule of the Niruttipitaka: First case suffixes are to be added in the sense of a nominative, second case suffixes in the sense of an accusative, third case suffixes in the sense of an instrumental, fourth case suffixes in the sense of a dative, fifth case suffixes in the sense of an ablative, the sixth case suffixes in the sense of a genitive, the seventh case suffixes in the sense of a locative, and the eighth case suffixes in the sense of a vocative.

    In this regard, here is the summarizing verse:
    Nominative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Ablative, Genitive, Locative and eighth is the Vocative".

    2 "Where eight cases are used in various meanings".
In Pali, the term used for the vocative case is älapana. ${ }^{1}$ Älapana literally 'conversation, talking to, addressing', ${ }^{2}$ is derived from the root $\bar{a}+l a p$ meaning 'to address'. Here it should be noted that at Pj I 167 and II 435, the vocative case is called ämantanavacana. At MV 2.241, ämantana is used in its technical sense of 'an address term'. ${ }^{3}$

Apart from this, Agg and Mogg have used the term ämantana in its non-technical sense of addressing. ${ }^{4}$ The term ämantana / ämantanā literally meaning 'addressing, calling; invitation, greeting' (Sn 40; Pj I 167) is derived from $\bar{a}+$ manta 'to call'. At Sadd 576, Agg defines ämantana as: yam älapati, tad ämantanam
"That to which one addresses is called ämantana".
MVu 2.40, on the other hand, explains ämantana as:
"Calling one's attention by means of words is called ämantana". ${ }^{5}$

This has a striking similarity with DV 2.1.5 and DT 2.4.18. (See below)

# B. 

In Sanskrit, the term denoting the vocative case is ämantrita. In this sense, it first occurs in the Prātisāakhyas ${ }^{6}$ and the Aṣt at P

1 akutarassā lato yvālapanassa ve vo (Kacc 116); amälapanekavacane (Kacc 153), rassa lato yvālapanassa ve vo (Sadd 291); matantare pumassa am älapanekavacane (Sadd 333).
2 Vin III.73; Ja V.253; Vism 23; Pj II 396; Pv-a 131.
3 ämantanam pubbumasantam va / (MV 2.241)
4 ämantane si gasañño (Sadd 204), ämantane (MV 2.40).
5 sato suddenäbhimukhikaranam ämantanam /
6 okāra ämantritajah pragrhyah (RP 1.68); padapārvam ämantritam anānārthe'pādādau (VP 2.17); ämantritam cetāv anārṣe (CA 1.81); ämantritād ādyudättād ākhyātaṃ na nihanyate / (AP 1.1.23)
2.3.48: sāmantritam. Here, āmantrita denotes a nominal stem ending in the first sup triplet used in addressing.

Śarva uses the term āmantrita at Kt 2.1.5: āmantrite sih sambuddhiḥ, ${ }^{1}$ in its non-technical sense of 'addressing'. Commenting on the word āmantrita, Durga says:
"Āmantrita is the act of drawing attention of the existing one". ${ }^{2}$ (DV 2.1.5)

However, at DT 2.3.4, Durga uses the word āmantrita in the same sense as that of P: āmantritam pūrvam avidyamānavat.

C also uses āmantrita in the same sense in CV 6.3.24: āmantritam pūrvam asadvat.

Āmantrana occurs in the ŚB in the sense of 'addressing':
ambeti vai yoṣāyā āmantraṇam / (ŚB 6.2.5)
Śarva also uses āmantraṇa in the same sense at Kt 2.4.18: $\bar{a} m a n t r a n e ~ c a$. Note that in Kt , both the terms $\bar{a} m a n t r i t a$ as well as $\bar{a} m a n t r a n a$ have the same sense. Cp. DT's explanation of the term āmantraṇa: siddhasyābhimukhībhāvamātram āmantraṇam / ${ }^{3}$

# C. 

In the Pali commentarial literature, the term āmantanavacana is used to denote the vocative. The Pali grammarians have, however, chosen the term ālapana for the same. This term is unparalleled in Sanskrit where the term āmantrita is used to denote a word in the vocative.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "The term sumbuddhi denotes the suffix si in the sense of addressing".
    2 siddhasyābhimukhīkaranam āmantritam/
    3 "Āmantrana is the act of drawing attention of the existing one".
To sum up, the case terminology used in the Atṭhakathās has not found its way in the Pali grammars. The case terminology of the Pali grammars has been directly taken over from the Sanskrit grammar with the sole exception of älapana.

# 4. sambuddhi / ga 

## A.

The Sanskrit and the Pali grammarians always talk about the seven cases (vibhaktis) and do not treat vocative as a separate case from the nominative. However, since vocative singular usually has special forms different from the nominative singular, both the Sanskrit as well as the Pali grammarians have coined special terms to denote it.

The Pali grammarians have used the monosyllabic term ga to denote the vocative singular suffix $s i$ :
älapane si gasañño / (Kacc 57)
ämantane si gasañño / (Sadd 204)
"In the sense of 'address', the suffix $s i$ is designated as ga."
go syälapane / (MV 1.12)
"(The technical term) ga denotes (the suffix) si in the sense of 'address'".

Here, the influence of ämantrite sih sambuddhiḥ (Kt 2.1.5) on the formation of these rules is quite evident. In this case, the Pali grammarians' choice of the letter ga for this purpose appears to be arbitrary. Here, it is noteworthy that at Kacc 153: am älapanekavacane and Sadd 333: matantare pumassa am älapanekavacane, K and Agg use älapanekavacana instead of ga to denote the vocative singular. In this connection, it would be
interesting to note that CA and Śākaṭāyana use ekämantrita and ekämantrana respectively for sambuddhi. ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

Among the Sanskrit grammarians, P and Śarva have used the term sambuddhi to denote the vocative singular: ekavacanaṃ sambuddhih / (P 2.3.49)
"(The technical term) sambuddhi denotes the singular (of the first sup triplet)".
āmantrite sih sambuddhih / (Kt 2.1.5)
"The technical term sambuddhi denotes the suffix si in case of address."

Though sambodhana and sambuddhi have the same meaning (address), both these grammarians have preferred the shorter term sambuddhi for this purpose.

C uses sambodhane su for sambuddhi at CV 6.2.44: sambodhane sau. He also uses the word sambuddhi at CV 6.3.49: na sambuddhau.

## C.

The Pali grammarians have used the monosyllabic arbitrary $g a$ for the sambuddhi of the Sanskrit grammarians.

## 5. tenses and moods

## A.

In Pali, there are three moods and five tenses. These are:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ekämantrite raudvivacanāntasya (CA 2.47), vīśanośanannaghobhagobhossamaś caikāmantraṇe (Śā.Vyā.1.2.121).
| Moods | Imperative |
| :-- | :-- |
|  | Optative |
|  | Conditional |
| Tenses | Past perfect |
|  | Past imperfect |
|  | Aorist |
|  | Future |
|  | Present |

In the Kacc and the Sadd, a section dealing with moods and tenses is headed by the governing rule käle (Kacc 415, Sadd 872). Here, it should be noted that a similar section in Kt is also headed by the rule käle ( Kt 3.1.10). P, however, has done away with this adhikära rule. This is the reason for which his grammar is described as "a grammar without the heading rule kāla". ${ }^{1}$

The terminology used by K and Agg for moods and tenses is identical. Each of these tenses and moods is called vibhatti by these grammarians. ${ }^{2}$ Mogg tries to avoid use of these terms as usual. In his grammar, some of these moods and tenses are mentioned by combining the initial suffix of that particular mood or tense with the word $\bar{a} d i$. This terminology would be evident from the following chart:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Pāninyupajñam akālakam vyākaranam / (CVr 2.2.68, Kāśikā on P 2.4.21)
    2 paccuppanne käle vattamānā vibhatti hoti (Kacc-Vu 416); apaccakkhe atīte kāle parokkhā vibhatti hoti (Kacc-Vu 419) etc.

14 āissādi svañ va / (MV 6.15)
The obvious source of K and Agg's terminology is the Kt. (See below). As is quite evident, all these terms except pañcamī and sattam $\bar{\imath}$ are self-explanatory. About pañcamī and sattamī, it is believed that the earlier names of these moods were lost. Therefore, in the Kt , the terms pañcam $\bar{\imath}$ and saptam $\bar{\imath}$ are used to denote imperative and optative respectively because lot (imperative) and lin (optative) occupy the fifth and the seventh position in the P's scheme of the ten lakāras, if the let 'Subjunctive', which is confined to Vedic, is excluded. Cf. K. C. Chatterji, 1964: 12, 13. Thus, in the Kacc and the Sadd, the terms pañcam $\bar{\imath}$ and sattam $\bar{\imath}$ have lost their relevance.

Here it should be noted that at MV 5.17: kyo bhāvakammesvaparokkhāsu mānantatyādisu and MV 5.70: parokkhāyañ ca, just as K and Agg, Mogg has used the term parokkh $\bar{a}$ to denote the past perfect.

# B. 

In the field of the Sanskrit grammar, P has introduced a novel scheme of the ten lakāras ( $l$-sounds) to denote moods and tenses. It is generally believed that P has taken this $l$ from the word kāla. In P's system, the names of the different moods and tenses are:

| Lat $^{1}$ | Present |
| :-- | :-- |
| Lit $^{2}$ | Past Perfect |
| Lut $^{3}$ | Periphrastic <br> future |

1 vartamāne lat / (P 3.2.123, CV 1.2.82)
2 parokse lit / (P 3.2.115, CV 1.2.81)
3 anadyatane lut / (P 3.3.15, CV 1.3.3)
| Lrt ${ }^{1}$ | Simple future |
| :-- | :-- |
| Let $^{2}$ | Subjunctive |
| Lot $^{3}$ | Imperative |
| Lan $^{4}$ | Past imperfect |
| Lin $^{5}$ | Optative |
| Lun $^{6}$ | Aorist |
| Lr $^{7}$ | Conditional |

P has no special term for the precative. It is simply expressed as āśişi lin. Cf. P 3.4.116: lin āśişi /
"(The technical term ārdhadhātuka also) denotes (the $l$-substitutes of $l$-member) lin when denoting benediction 'Precative or Benedictive mood'."

C follows P in this respect. The let lakāra denoting the subjunctive mood is, however, absent in CV as C excludes the treatment of the Vedic Sanskrit.

Śarva has retained most of the older terms of the moods and the tenses. The technical terms used in his system are:

```
1 lṛt śese ca (P 3.3.13); bhavisyati lṛt (CV 1.3.2).
2 linarthe let / (P 3.4.7)
3 lot ca (P 3.3.162); lot (CV 1.3.122).
4 anadyatane lañ / (P 3.2.111, CV 1.2.77)
5 vidhinimantraṇāmantraṇādhīṣṭasamprasnaprārthaneṣu lin (P 3.3.161);
vidhi-samprasnaprārthaneṣu (CV 1.3.121).
6} lun / (P 3.2.110, CV 1.2.76)
7 liñnimitte lṛn kriyātipattau (P 3.3.139); liñyātipattau lṛn (CV 1.3.107).
```

| Saptamī ${ }^{10}$ | Optative |

Following is a table of corresponding technical terms from the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammars in order to present a clear-cut picture:

# C. 

From the above discussion, it is quite clear that instead of adopting P and C's scheme of lakāras, K and Agg have followed the terminology available in the Kt. Mogg, on the other hand, has adopted a totally different method and has mentioned the tenses and moods by their initial suffixes.
# 6. parassapada, attanopada 

## A.

The terms, parassapada and attanopada are purely grammatical in nature. The Pali grammarians have taken these terms from their Sanskrit counterparts. Explaining these terms, the Kacc-Vn says:
"The morphemes that are used for the sake of others are parassapada. It is a compound with no elision of the case ending. They are called parassapada as they manifest the kāraka relation other than the 'object' i.e. the 'agent'". 1
"The morphemes that are used for one's own sake are attanopada. They are called attanopada as they manifest the kāraka relation 'object' which is designated as 'attano', i.e. 'one's own'". ${ }^{2-}$

According to K and Agg, the technical term parassapada denotes the initial six suffixes of every verbal case, such as ti, anti; si, tha; mi, ma. Cf.:
atha pubbāni vibhattinaṃ cha parassapadāni / (Kacc 408)
pubbāni vibhattinaṃ cha parassapadāni / (Sadd 865)

1 parassa atthāya pavattāni padāni parassapadāni, aluttasamāso / kammakārakato parabhātassa kattukārakassa pakāsanato parassapadāni nāma / (Kacc-Vn 408)
2 uttano atthāya pavattāni padāni attunopadāni / attunosañkhātassa kammakārakassa dīpanuto attunopadāni / (Kacc-Vn 409)
Attanopada, on the other hand, denotes the latter six suffixes of every verbal case, such as te, ante; se, vhe; e, mhe. ${ }^{1}$ Cf.:

parāny attanopadāni / (Kacc 409)
parāni attanopadāni / (Sadd 866)
The parassapada endings are added to a verbal root in the sense of an agent ${ }^{2}$ whereas the attanopada endings are added in the sense of an impersonal action (bhāva) or an object (kamma). ${ }^{3}$ This division of the parassapada and the attanopada endings is not so rigid in Pali. In Pali, the parassapada endings are used more frequently than the attanopada endings. Cf.:
"Sometimes the attanopada endings are changed to the parassapada endings". ${ }^{4}$

In Sadd's Dhātumālā, Agg uses the terms attanobhāsā, parassabhāsā and ubhatobhāsā for those verbal roots, which take attanopada, parassapada and either of the two endings respectively. Note that these terms have their parallels in the Sanskrit tradition. (See below)

Though the terms parassapada and attanopada are missing in the rules of the MV, they are given as examples at MVu 2.121 of an alutta / aluk compound. In Mogg's grammar, the term expressing the parassapada is pubbacchakka and the term denoting the attanopada is paracchakka:
o vikaranassu paracchakke / (MV 6.76)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Sabbāsaṃ vibhattinaṃ yāni yāni parāni cha padāni tāni tāni attanopadasaññāni honti, taṃ yathā - te, ante; se, vhe; e, mhe / (Kacc-Vu 409)
    2 kattari parassapadam / (Kacc 458, Sadd 938). Cp. śesāt kurtari parasmaipadam / (Kt 3.2.47)
    3 attanopadāni bhāve ca kammaṇi (Kacc 455); bhāvakammesv attanopadam (Sadd 934). Cp. ātmanepadāni bhāvakarmaṇoh / (Kt 3.2.40)
    4 attanopadāni parassapadattam (Kacc 520); attanopadāni kvaci parassapadattam / (Sadd 1031)
"In case of the set of following six (suffixes), the conjugational affix $o$ is substituted by $u$ ".
pubbacchakke vā kvaci / (MV 6.77)
"The conjugational affix $o$ is rarely substituted by $u$ in case of the set of initial six (suffixes)."

# B. 

The term parasmaipada means the suffixes, which indicate that the result of an action is in favour of someone other than the agent. Similarly, the term ātmanepada means the suffixes, which indicate that the result of an action is in favour of one's own self (an agent). Cp. P 1.3.72: svaritañitah kartrabhiprāye kriyāphale. ${ }^{1}$ Thus, both the terms appear to be self-explanatory. However, by the time of P , these terms were no longer self-explanatory. As a result, P had to form a number of rules to describe their usage. Cf. P 1.3.12 to 1.3.93.

Before P, ātmanebhāṣā / ātmanepada and parasmaibhāṣā / parasmaipada were in use side by side. Ātmanebhāṣā and parasmaibhāṣā occur in AP ${ }^{2}$ whereas ātmanepada and parasmaipada are found in the Kāśakrtsnavyākaraṇa. ${ }^{3}$ Here, it should be noted that commenting on P 6.3.7-8, Ptj also uses the terms ātmanebhāṣā and parasmaibhāṣā:
"An addition should be made of the words ātmanebhāṣā and parasmaibhāṣā". 4

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "(Ātmanepada $l$-substitutes are introduced after a verbal stem) marked with a svarita accent or $\tilde{n}$ as $i t$, if the result of the action is intended for the agent".

    2 varṇalopāgamahrasvadīrghaplutātmanebhāṣaparasmaibhāṣā apiyantyapi-yanti / (AP 3.4.7)

    3 anudāttanānubandha ātmanepadam (Kā.Vyā. 88 etc.); udāttānubandhah parṣ̄smaipadam / (Kā.Vyā. 90)

    4 ātamanebhāṣaparasmaibhāṣayor upasañkhyānam / (Mbh III.143)
Commenting on this, Kaiyaṭa says:
"The verbal roots taking the ātmanepada endings are referred to by the grammarians by the word ätmanebhāṣa and the verbal roots taking the parasmaipada endings by the word parasmaibhāṣā". ${ }^{1}$

P defines parasmaipada and ātmanepada as:
lah parasmiapadam / (P 1.4.99)
"(The technical term) parasmaipada denotes (the substitutes of) $l$-members."
tan̄ānāv ātmanepadam / (P 1.4.100)
"(The technical term) ātmanepada denotes (the substitutes of $l$-members) indicated by (the abbreviation) tan and the affixes having $\bar{a} n a$ in common".

According to P , the parasmaipada endings are generally added to a verbal root in the sense of an agent, whereas the ätmanepada endings are added in the sense of an impersonal action (bhāva) or an object (karma). Cf.:
šeṣāt kartari parasmaipadam / ${ }^{2}$ (P 1.3.78)
bhāvakarmaṇoḥ / ${ }^{3}$ (P 1.3.13)
In Kt , the rules defining the parasmaipada and the ātmanepada endings are:
atha parasmaipadāni / (Kt 3.1.1)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ātumepadinaś ca dhātavo vaiyākaranair ātmanebhāṣāśabdena vyavahriyante, parasmaipadinaḥ parasmaibhāṣāśabdena / (Pradīpa 6.3.7-8)
    2 "After the remaining verbal stems, when an agent is to be denoted, parasmaipada l-substitutes are introduced".
    3 "(Ātmanepada l-substitutes are introduced after verbal stems) when an impersonal action (bhāva) or an object (karman) is to be expressed".
"The technical term parasmaipada denotes the initial nine suffixes of every verbal case". ${ }^{1}$ (DV 3.1.1)
parāny ātmane / (Kt 3.1.2)
"The technical term ātmanepada denotes the following nine suffixes of every verbal case". ${ }^{2}$ (DV 3.1.2)

C uses tan̄āna for ātmanepada and atan for parasmaipada. For P's anudāttanita ātmanepadam (P 1.3.12) C has tan̄ānā yathāpātham (CV 1.4.46) and for P's parasmaipadānām nalatususthalathusanalvamāh (P 3.4.82) C has atanām ngalatususthalathusanalvamāh (CV 1.4.11).

# C. 

To sum up, the terms parassapada / parasmaipada and attanopada / ātmanepada are common to Kacc, Sadd, Astt and Kt. However, in Kacc, Sadd and Kt , they are restricted to the finite verbal endings, whereas in Ast, they are also extended to some primary suffixes, which are substitutes in place of the finite verbal endings. Mogg has adopted a different method to express these concepts.

## 7. purisa

A.

Purisa is a generic term used by the Pali grammarians to denote the concept of a grammatical person. It is quite conspicuous that they have borrowed this term from Sanskrit. Here, it is noteworthy that the terms majjhimapurisa and pathamapurisa in the sense of the second and the third person respectively occur at Vv-a 13.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sarvavibhaktīnām ādau navavacanāni parasmaipadasamjñāni bhavanti /
    2 sarvavibhaktīnām parāni navavacanāni ātmanepadasamjñāni bhavanti/
K and Agg have defined the three persons as:
dve dve paṭhamamajjhimuttamapurisā / (Kacc 410, Sadd 867)
"Each pair of the parassapada and the attanopada endings of every verbal case is called the third, the second and the first person respectively".

Here, it should be noted that sometimes K and Agg have used pathama, majjhima and uttama by dropping the word purisa for the third, the second and the first person respectively. Cf. nāmamhi payujjamāne pi tulyādhikaraṇe paṭhamo (Kacc 412); nāme payujjamāne pi tulyādhikaraṇe paṭhamo (Sadd 869); tumhe majjhimo (Kacc 413, Sadd 870) and amhe uttamo (Kacc 414, Sadd 871).

Although the term purisa is missing in the rules of MV, the terms paṭhama, majjhima and uttama are used at MV 6.14:
pubbaparacchakkānam ekānekesu tumhāmhasesesu dve dve majjhimuttamapaṭhamā /

Purisa, however, occurs at MVu 1.22, 6.13.1

# B. 

Puruṣa in the sense of 'a grammatical person' probably occurred for the first time in the Nir:
"Of these, the indirectly addressed stanzas are composed in all the cases of nouns but the verb of the third person only. ... Now, the directly addressed stanzas are compositions in the second person and are joined with the pronoun tvam. ... Now, the selfinvocations are compositions in the first person and are joined with the pronoun aham". ${ }^{2}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yathā dvinnam tinnam vā purisānam sahapattiyam paro (MVu 1.22); ... tvādīnām evetam majjhimapurisekuvacanānam ābhikkhaññe dvivacanam / (MVu 6.13)
    2 tatra paroksakrtāh sarvābhir nāmabhir yujyante prathamapurusais cākhyātasya / ... atha pratyaksakrtā madhyamapurusayogās tvam iti caitena
Commenting on P 1.4.101: tins trīni prathamamadhyamauttamāh, Bālamanoramā says:
"Puruṣa in the sense of the third person etc. is a well-established term in the treatises of the ancient teachers. Thus, it should be understood". ${ }^{1}$

P drops the word puruṣa and uses prathama, madhyama and uttama instead. Cf. P 1.4.101: tiñs trīni trīni prathamamadhyamottamāh /
"(The technical terms) prathama (third), madhyama (second) and uttama (first) respectively denote the three (and) three triplets of tin".

Śarva generally uses prathama, madhyama and uttama like P. Cf. Kt 3.1.3: trīni trīni prathamamadhyamottamāh $l^{2}$ However, it also uses the generic term purusa in the rule: yugapadvacane parah puruṣānām (Kt 3.1.4).

C expresses the idea of the madhyamapuruṣa and the uttamapuruṣa by madhyamatrayam and uttama. Cf. CV 1.4.146: yuṣmadi madhyamatrayam and CV 1.4.147: asmady uttamam. The idea of prathamapuruṣa is expressed by ādyāh. Cf. CV 1.4.18: luṭah ādyānāṃ ḍāraurasah /

# C. 

With respect to the usage of the generic term purisa and the terms pathama, majjhima and uttama with or without purisa, all the Pali grammarians have followed the footsteps of P and Sarva. Mogg, who generally follows C, has also deviated from C and has followed his Pali predecessors on this occasion.

[^0]
[^0]:    sarvanāmnā / ... athādhyātmikya uttamapuruṣayogāh / aham iti caitena sarvanāmnā / (Nir 7.2)
    1 prathamādiṣu puruṣasaṃjñā tu prācīnācāryaśāstrasiddheti bodhyam / (Bāla-manoramā 2160)
    2 "(The technical terms) prathama (third), madhyama (second) and uttama (first) denote the three (and) three triplets of the parasmaipada and the ātmanepada endings respectively".
# 8. sabbadhātuka, asabbadhātuka 

## A.

Sabbadhātuka is a purely grammatical term. The Pali grammarians have taken it from Sanskrit. The same is also true in the case of the term asabbadhātuka.

Following P and Śarva, K and Agg have used the neuter form sabbadhātukam: Cf. Kacc 433, Sadd 904: Hiyattanīsttamīpañcamīvattamānā sabbadhātukam /1

Defining the term sabbadhātuka, K and Agg say:
hiyattanīsttamīpañcamīvattamānā sabbadhātukam /
"The technical term sabbadhātuka denotes the finite verbal endings of hiyuttanī (imperfect), sattamī (optative), pañcamī (imperative), and vattamānā (present)". ${ }^{2}$ (Kacc 433, Sadd 904)

This has a striking similarity with DV 3.1.34. (See below)
Explaining the term further, Agg says:
"It occurs mostly in case of entire verbal roots, thus it is called sabbadhātuka. What is it? The fortyeight types of suffixes $a, u$ etc., which are collected under the four headings. Ultimately, they are the same as the four verbal cases, imperfect etc. which

1 In H. Smith's edition, the rule is given as: hīyattanīsttamīpañcamīvattamānā sabbadhātukā (Sadd 904). However, this appears to be a faulty reading, as this is the only instance where Agg has used the feminine form. Smith records that in some mss. sabbadhātukam occurs instead of sabbadhātuka. Cf. p. 821, fn m. Note that even in the subsequent commentary, Agg has used sabbadhātukam: yebhuyyena sabbāsu dhātusu vattutī ti sabbadhātukam /

2 hīyattanādayo catasso vibhattiyo sabbadhātukasaññā honti (Kacc-Vu 433); hīyattanīādikā catasso vibhattiyo sabbadhātukasaññā honti / (Sadd 904)
are called sabbadhātuka. Thus, it should be understood". ${ }^{1}$

Though the term asabbadhātuka is not defined, the term quite conspicuously applies to the cases other than those called sabbadhātuka. It is used in rules asabbadhātuke bhū (Kacc 509, Sadd 1020); ikārāgamo asabbadhātukamhi (Kacc 518) and asabbadhātuke ikārāgamo (Sadd 1030). In Pali grammars, the main function of these two terms is to distinguish between the finite verbal endings which take an augment $i$ from those which do not. Cf. Kacc 518 and Sadd 1030:
"An augment $i$ is inserted before all the finite verbal endings denoted by the term asabbadhātuka".

The terms sabbadhātuka and asabbadhātuka are missing in Mogg's grammar. Thus, for asabbadhātuke bhū2 (Kacc 509, Sadd 1020), Mogg has a āssā ādisu ${ }^{3}$ (MV 5.129).

# B. 

According to K. C. Chatterji (1964: 51), in ancient times, the vikarana was regarded as a part and parcel of the root. Therefore, those endings before which the vikarana was reserved were known as sārvadhātuka endings, because the endings were added to the entire root. ${ }^{4}$ Those, which were added to the root without vikarana,

1 yebhuyyena sabbāsu dhātusu vuttatī ti sabbadhātukam, kin tam: catūhi nāmehi sangahitam a u icc ādikam atthacattālīsavidham padam, tañ ca kho atthato catasso vibhattiyo yevā ti 'hīyyattanī-ādikā catasso vibhattiyo sabbadhātukasaññā honti' ti vuttan ti datthabham / (Sadd 904)
2 "Asa is optionally substituted by $b h \bar{u}$ before the finite verbal endings denoted by the term asabbadhātuka".

3 "The verbal root asa (in the sense of 'to be') is substituted by $b h \bar{u}$ before suffixes $a$ etc., $\bar{a}$ etc., and ssa etc.".

4 sarvadhātur eva sārvadhātukah / (Gūdhārthaprakāśikā on PR)
were known as ārdhadhātuka endings, because before these endings, only half the root i.e. a part of the root was discernible.

The earlier form of the word was sārvadhātuka, which was used by Āpiśali and which, as an adjective to vibhakti, was naturally feminine. Commenting on P 7.3.95: turustušamyamah sārvadhātuke, Kāśikā says:

Āpiśalāh turustušamyamah sārvadhātukāsu cchandasīti pathanti /

Jinendrabuddhi comments:
"Because, Āpiśali has formulated the word sārvadhātuk $\bar{a}$ in the feminine gender as a proper name". ${ }^{1}$

It seems that at the time of Āpiśali, the term was self-explanatory. However, by the time of P , it lost its significance. Consequently, we can see that from P onwards, the term is used in the neuter gender as sārvadhātukam. DT on Kt 3.1.34 says:
"The term sārvadhātukam is a popularly established proper name coined by the earlier teachers and is without an etymological tradition". ${ }^{2}$

P's rule defining the term sārvadhātuka reads: tiñśit sārvadhātukam / (P 3.4.113)
"(The technical term) sārvadhātuka denotes the $l$ substitutes (affixes) implied by the abbreviation tin and those marked with $s$ as $i t$ ".

At P 3.4.114, P uses the term ārdhadhātuka as opposed to sārvadhātuka: ārdhadhātukam śsṣah. According to this rule,
"(The technical term) ārdhadhātuka denotes the residue (of affixes introduced after a verbal stem)".

[^0]
[^0]:    1 strīlingasārvadhātukaśabdasya samjj̃ā̄tvenāpiśalinā prant̄tutvāt /
    2 sārvadhātukaṃ napuṃsakaṃ lokatah siddham pārvācāryasaṃjñā niranvayeyam/
Besides this, there are three more rules defining ārdhadhātuka:
lit ca "(The technical term ārdhadhātuka) also denotes (the $l$-substitutes of $l$-member) lit (perfect tense)." (P 3.4.115)
lini āśisi "(The technical term ārdhadhātuka also) denotes (the $l$-substitutes of $l$-member) lin when denoting benediction (precative or benedictive mood)." (P 3.4.116)
chandasy ubhayath $\bar{a}$ "In the domain of chandas, both (= sārvadhātuka and ārdhadhātuka) denote the $l$-substitutes implied by the abbreviation tin and affixes with marker $s$ as it as well as residual affixes introduced after a verbal stem." (P 3.4.117)

Śarva defines sārvadhātuka as: șadādyāh sārvadhātukam. The rule literally means that "The term sārvadhātuka denotes the initial six verbal cases." (Kt 3.1.34) The initial six verbal cases in Kt are: vartamānā (present), saptamī (optative), pañcamī (imperative), hyastanī (imperfect), adyatanī (aorist), and paroks $\bar{a}$ (perfect). But since adyatanī and paroks $\bar{a}$ can not be treated as sārvadhātuka, the commentators interpret this rule as:
"Out of six, the initial four verbal cases such as present, optative, imperative and imperfect are designated as sārvadhātuka". ${ }^{1}$

In Kt , the term asārvadhātuka is used in the place of P's ārdhadhātuka. Cf. Kt 3.4.87: aster bhūr asārvadhātuke /
C, as usual, avoids these technical terms. Instead of sārvadhātuka he uses alidā̄sīrli̇ tiñ̄sit. Cp. for instance, P 3.1.67: sārvadhātuke yak, CV 1.1.80: tiñšiti yagalidā̄sīr liñi / For ārdhadhātuka, C uses liḍāšīr liñ atinšsit. Cp. P 2.4.35: ārdhadhātuke, CV 5.4.78: liḍāšīr liñ atinšsiti/

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sannām vibhaktīnām ādyā vartamānā-saptamī-pañcamī-hyastanyaś catasro vibhaktayah sārvadhātukasaṃjñā bhavanti / (DV 3.1.34)
# C. 

From the above discussion, it is quite clear that with regard to the usage of the terms sabbadhātuka / sārvadhātuka and asabbadhātuka / ārdhadhātuka, K and Agg have followed Śarva. These terms are, however, missing in the grammars of Mogg and C. Like Śarva, K and Agg have restricted the scope of these terms to the finite verbal endings. P , on the other hand, extends it even to the primary endings.

## IV. Terms denoting other suffixes

## 1. taddhita

## A.

The term taddhita is evidently derived from tassa hitam (Skt. tasmai hitam). It stands for all the secondary suffixes. The Pali grammarians have used the same term to denote the secondary suffixes as well as the secondary derivatives, i.e. words derived by applying secondary suffixes.

In Kacc, the eighth section of the second chapter is called Taddhitakappa. Besides this, K uses the term only once in the sense of a secondary affix: taddhitasamāsakitakā nāmaṃ vā tavetūnādisu ca / ${ }^{1}$ (Kacc 603)

The twenty-forth chapter of Sadd's Suttamālā is called Taddhitakappa. According to Agg, in the Pali grammatical tradition, the term taddhita signifies the secondary suffixes $n a$ etc. which convey the sense of 'an offspring' etc. Besides this, the term also signifies the grammatical process, which is accomplished by

[^0]
[^0]:    1 taddhita-samāsa-kitakā iccevamantā saddā nāmaṃ va daṭthabbā tave-tūna-tvāna-tvādippaccuye vajjetvā/ (Kacc-Vu 603)
way of imagination. ${ }^{1}$ Thus, forms like puris $\bar{a}$, which are instances of part retaining or numerals such as vissati, catuddasa, or compounds such as adduddha (three and a half), which are derived through other imaginary derivational processes, are also brought within the category of taddhita. ${ }^{2}$ Here, Agg is following K who has dealt with the phenomenon of part retaining and compounds of numerals in his Taddhitakappa. Cf. Kacc 390; 378-389; 391-92. Further in the commentary, Agg provides a semantic analysis of the term taddhita in accordance with this twofold usage of the term:
"In this regard, this is the semantic analysis: Suffixes $n a$ etc. are called taddhita because they are beneficial; favourable to the meanings 'offspring' etc. as the understanding of the meaning of the words is dependent on suffixes. Or, they are called taddhita because they are beneficial; favourable to the groups of words Väsittha etc. as they are to be added after words denoting 'family' etc. Or, the suffixes $n a$ etc. and the grammatical operations such as part retaining, elision, substitution etc. which are to be carried out wherever required are called taddhita because they are beneficial; favourable to those nobles, who have applied themselves to listening, learning, and retaining as they fulfill the goal of such (nobles) who have entered the path of understanding the meaning". ${ }^{3}$
1 taddhitan ti apaccādiatthesu pavattānaṃ nādiipaccayānaṃ nāmam; parikappādivasena nipphādetubbassa vidhino pi nāmam / (Excursus before Sadd 751, p. 782)
2 evañ hi sati 'puriso ca puriso ca purisā' ti ca 'dasa ca dasa ca vīsati' ti ca 'catāhi adhikā dasa catuddasā' ti ca 'addhena catuttho addhuddho' ti ca ādīni paccayarahitapadāni pi taddhitapadāni ti gahetabbāni honti, nāññathā / (Excursus before Sadd 751, p. 782)
3 tatrāyaṃ vacanattho: paccayāyattattā saddatthādhigamassa tesam apaccādi-atthānaṃ hitam anukālan ti taddhitam / gottādivācakasudduto vā bhavitabbuttā tesam, Vasiṭthasaddādīnaṃ saddagaṇānaṃ hitam anukālan ti taddhitam, nādiipaccayo; atha vā atthādhigamāya patipannānaṃ tadattha-
Moreover, the words formed by this derivational process are also called taddhitas. Cf. Sadd 677: samāsataddhitākhyātakitakānam paccaya-pad'-akkharāgamā ca /

The term taddhita is missing in MV. In M's grammar, the chapter dealing with the taddhita derivations is called ņ̄̄dikanḍa, as $\underline{n} a$ is the first secondary suffix taught in this chapter. Unlike P , the Pali grammarians have not included samāsānta suffixes (compound finals) under taddhita.

# B. 

Taddhita in its technical sense occurs in the Nir where Y talks of single membered and multi-membered compounds and secondary derivatives:
"Now with regard to derivatives and compounds, whether of one or more than one member, one should explain their component parts in their respective order, having first divided (the words) into them". ${ }^{1}$

Nir gives daṇdya as an instance of ekaparvan taddhita and kakṣy $\bar{a}$ as an instance of anekaparvan taddhita. From this it is clear that Y has included feminine suffixes under taddhita. P, however, has dealt with them separately.

P's rule taddhitāh (4.1.76) is a heading rule. It teaches:
"Whatever is taught in the subsequent rules till the last rule of the fifth chapter gets the taddhita designation". ${ }^{2}$

[^0]
[^0]:    sādhakattā tesaṃ savan'uggahaṇadhāraṇābhiyuttānaṃ kulaputtānaṃ hitam anukālan ti taddhitam, nādipaccayo c' eva tattha tattha ekasesalopādesādikāttabbavidhi ca / (Excursus before Sadd 751, p. 783)
    1 atha taddhitasamāsesv ekaparvasu cānekaparvasu ca pūrvam pūrvam aparam aparam pravibhajya nirbrūyāt / (Nir 2.2)
    2 adhikāro'yam / āpañcamādhyāyaparisamāpteḥ yān ita ūrdhvam anukramiṣyāmah taddhitasamjñās te veditavyāh / (Kāśikā 4.1.76)
Here it should be noted that samāsāntas are regarded as taddhita by P .

In Kt , the sixth section of the second chapter is called taddhita. C does not use the term. For P's taddhiteṣv acām ādeh and kiti ca (P 7.2.117-8), C has kiti cāpatyādāv acām ādeh (CV 6.1.11).

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have borrowed the term taddhita from Sanskrit. In the Pali grammars, the term is used in the sense of the secondary affixes as well as the secondary derivatives. In Kacc and Sadd, part retaining and the compounds of numerals are treated as taddhitas whereas in Aṣt, the phenomenon of part retaining is dealt with in a separate section and the compounds of numerals are treated in the compound section. Following C, Mogg has avoided the use of the term taddhita as usual.

## 2. samāsanta

## A.

Samāsanta is a name given to a class of affixes that are added at the end of a compounded word. A special feature of this kind of affixes is that they become a part of a compound to which they are added.

The Pali grammarians have taught this type of suffixes in the chapter dealing with compounds. Cf. Kacc 339-340; Sadd 722723, 725; MV 3.40-3.53. Among the Pali grammarians, Mogg alone has used the term samāsanta as a technical term of grammar. Cf. MV 3.40: samāsantva and following. ${ }^{1}$ The other two grammarians have used the word samāsanta in its non-technical sense. Cf. for instance, Kacc-Vu on Kacc 339:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 pāpādīhi parā yā bhāmi tassa samāsanto a hoti / (MVu 3.41)
"The final vowel of nouns forming the final member of a compound sometimes changes to $a^{\text {" }}$.

# B. 

In P's Ast, the term samāsānta is used of those secondary suffixes, which form the final portion of a compounded word. ${ }^{2}$ In Ast.., these suffixes are taught in rules P 5.4.68 - 5.4.160, which are governed by the heading rule taddhitāh / (P 4.1.76)

Šarva uses samāsānta in its non-technical sense. Cf. for instance, Kt 2.6.41: samāsāntagatānām vā rājādīnām adantatā /
"The words räjan etc., occurring as the final member of a compound, turn into words ending in vowel $a^{\prime \prime} .^{3}$

This is the only rule in Kt dealing with this type of suffixes.
C's usage of samāsānta is similar to that of P. C deals with these suffixes in rules CV 4.4.52 - 4.4.148.

## C.

K and Agg's usage of the term samāsanta is similar to that of Šarva. Mogg, on the other hand, has followed P and C in this respect. The Pali grammarians have treated samāsantas in the compound section. P and C , on the other hand, have included them in the taddhita section.

[^0]:    1 samāsantagatānaṃ nāmānam anto saro kvaci akāro hoti /
    2 samāsāntāh / (P 5.4.68) āpādaparisamāpter ye pratyayāh vihitās te samāsāntāvayavā ekādeśāh bhavanti, tadgrahaṇena grhyante iti veditavyam /(Kāśikā 5.4.68)
    3 samāsāntagatānāṃ rājādīnām adantatā nipātyate /(DT 2.6.41)
# 3. kita 

## A.

The term kita is formed from the root kar. It is an instance of a word formed with a primary suffix becoming a generic name for that kind of suffixes. In Pali, the usage of this term is limited to the grammatical literature.

In Kacc and Sadd, a section dealing with the primary derivatives is titled Kitakappa ${ }^{1}$ and Kibbidhānakappa ${ }^{2}$ respectively. K and Agg define kit in an identical fashion as: aññe kitam /
"Others are called kita." (Kacc 548, Sadd 1132)
Commenting on this rule, the Vutti says:
"Other (verbal) suffixes are designated as kita". ${ }^{3}$
Note that the rule, which immediately precedes this rule, is te kicc $\bar{a}$ which teaches the kicca designation in both the grammars. In this context, the rule aññe kitam means that the verbal suffixes other than the gerundive suffixes ( $k i c c a$ ) are called kita. Thus, unlike P , the Pali grammarians do not treat the gerundive suffixes as a subset of primary suffixes. This view is also supported by Rūp's comment on the rule taddhitasamāsakitakā nāmaṃ va tavetūnādisu ca ${ }^{4}$ :

[^0]
[^0]:    1 buddham ñānasamuddam sabbaññūm lokahetukhinnamatim / vanditvā pubbamaham vakkhāmi susādhanaṃ kitakappam //
    (Introductory verse of the Kacc's kibbhidhānakappa, p. 252)
    2 ito param pavakkhāmi kibbidhānaṃ hitamkaram /
    kosallatthāya viññānam pālidhamme subhāsite //
    (Introductory verse of Sadd's kibbidhānakappa, p. 844)
    3 aññe paccayā kita icceva saññā honti / (Kacc-Vu 548, Sadd 1132)
    4 "Compounds and the words ending in the primary and the secondary
    affixes, except those ending in the suffixes tave, tūna, tvāna and tvā are to
    be considered as nouns."
"The inclusion of the particle $c a$ in the rule is for giving the nāma designation to the words ending in gerundival and feminine suffixes". ${ }^{1}$

It implies that the gerundives ending in the kicca suffixes are not included in the primary derivatives.

According to K and Agg, the primary suffixes are generally added in the sense of an agent. ${ }^{2}$ Cf. Kacc 626: kattari kitam and Sadd 1231: kattari kit. Note that these rules have a striking similarity with P 3.4.67: kartari krt. Cf. Kt 4.2.7: krt.

The term kita is missing in Mogg's grammar. In his grammar, the fifth chapter is called the Khādikanḍa (the chapter beginning with kha) as it opens up with the rule: tijamānehi khas $\bar{a}$ khamāvīmaṃsāsu, which teaches the suffixes kha and sa.

Besides kita, the Pali grammarians have also used the term kitaka to denote the primary affixes. The term occurs only once in the rules of the Kacc: taddhitasamāsakitakā nāmaṃ va tavetūnādisu ca / ${ }^{3}$ (Kacc 603)

Agg has used kitaka twice in his rules and in both the places the word signifies a primary derivative. Cf. Sadd 525: Kitake antato siss' u vā ${ }^{4}$ and Sadd 677: samāsataddhitākhyātakitakānam paccayapad'akkharāgamā ca. ${ }^{5}$ Besides this, he also uses the terms

1 caggahanam kiccappaccayaitthippaccayantādissa pi nämavyapadesattham / (Rüp 319)

2 Kattari iccetasmim atthe kitam paccayā honti (Kacc-Vu 626), Kattukārake kitpaccayo hoti / (Sadd 1231)
3 taddhita-samāsa-kitakā iccevamantā saddā nāmam va daṭ̣habbā tave-tūna-tvāna-tvādippaccaye vajjetvā / (Kacc-Vu 603)
4 kitake pariyāpannato antapaccayato sivacanassa ukāro hoti vā / (Sadd 525)
5 na kevalam vibhattiyo yeva atha kho samāsataddhitākhyātakitakānam paccayapad'akkharāgamā ca kvaci lopam āpajjanti / (Sadd 677)
kitanta ${ }^{1}$ and dhätumaya ${ }^{2}$ to express a primary derivative. Note that the Kacc-Vu and the Kacc-Vn also use the term kitaka in the sense of a primary derivative. Cf.: tesaṃ-gahanena samāsa-taddhita-ākhyāta-kitakappadānaṃ vibhattippaccayapada'kkharāgamānañ ca lopo hoti (Kacc-Vu 319); sabbaṃ kitakapadaṃ kitakanāmam (Kacc-Vṇ 318).

Even in the MVu, kitaka is used in the sense of a primary derivative:
kitakappayoge kattukammesu 'bahulam' sambandhavacanicchāyaṃ chattihī / (MVu 2.41)

Thus, in the Pali grammatical tradition, kitaka signifies both, a primary suffix and a primary derivative. This term is, however, without parallel in Sanskrit.

# B. 

In almost every system of the Sanskrit grammar, the name for the primary suffix is $k r t$. In the technical sense, $k r t$ occurs for the first time in the Go. Brā:
krdantam arthavat prātipadikam / (Go.Brā. 1.1.26)
Next, it is found in Nir 2.2:
"Further, Vedic primary nouns are derived from the roots of classical Sanskrit as damūnāh (devoted to the house), kṣetrasādhāh (one who divides the fields etc.)". ${ }^{3}$

1 evaṃ hi parikappam akatvā pūrentī ti purisā ti gahane tam padam isapaccayaparattā kitantam nāma bhavati / (Excursus before Sadd 751, p. 782)

2 upapade dhātumayānaṃ niccaṃ samāso / (Sadd 682)
3 athāpi bhāṣikebhyo dhātubhyo naigamāh krto bhāṣyante damūnāh kṣetrasādhā iti /
Durgasinpha, the commentator of the Nir, explains krtāh here as "The words ending in a primary suffix". ${ }^{1}$

Here, it should be noted that Y uses the term nāmakarana 'nounmaking' to denote both the primary and the secondary suffixes. ${ }^{2}$

P defines krt as: kṛd atin / (P 3.1.93)
"(The technical term) krt denotes (affixes introduced after a verbal stem) other than the finite verbal endings denoted by the abbreviation tinn".

It is believed that Sarva, the author of the Kt , did not frame rules for krtpratyayas. These were supplied by Vararuci who says in his introduction:
vṛkṣādivad amī rūḍhāh krtinā na krtāh krtāh /
Kātyāyanena te sṛṣ̄̄āh vibuddhipratibuddhaye //
However, from Kt 2.4.41: kartṛkarmanoh kṛti, we come to know that even for Śarva the name of the primary suffixes was krt .

C, as usual, has avoided the use of the technical term krt. Instead of P's kartari krt, CV's rule reads: kartari nvul-trc-acah / (CV 1.1.139)

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have used the terms kita and kitaka to denote the primary affixes. Out of these, kitaka is also used in the sense of a primary derivative.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 krtpratyayāntāh śabdāh /
    2 avater gatyarthasya aso nāmakaranaḥ "(Avasāya) is derived from (the root) av, meaning to go, with the suffix asa." (Nir 1.17); kakso gāhateh / ksa iti nāmakaranah "Kakṣah (armpit) is derived from (the root) gah (to plunge into) with the suffix ksa." (Nir 2.2)
# 4. kicca 

## A.

The word kicca literally means that which ought to be done, that which is to be performed; duty, obligation, etc. (Dhp-a I.15, Pj I 218; A II.67; Dhp 276). In the grammatical context, the term signifies gerundive suffixes. The term kicca is itself a gerundive and is derived from the root kara with the suffix ricca (Kacc 544, Sadd 1127). Mogg gives kicca as a nipātana: kicca-ghacca-bhacca-bhabba-leyyā (MV 5.31). Like kit, kicca is taken as the representative of all the gerundive suffixes.
te kicca (Kacc 547, Sadd 1131), which agrees verbatim with te krtyāh (Kt 4.2.46), teaches that the suffixes beginning with tabba upto ricca are to be known as kicca (gerundive suffixes). ${ }^{1}$ These suffixes are: tabba, anīya (Kacc 542, Sadd 1125), nya (Kacc 543, Sadd 1126), and ricca (Kacc 544, Sadd 1127). Agg teaches an additional suffix teyya (Sadd 1126) to derive the forms like ñāteyya, and ditṭheyya.

The term kicca is missing in MV. Here, the gerundive suffixes are generally expressed as tabbādi. ${ }^{2}$ Mogg deals with the gerundive suffixes in rules 5.27-5.32 in which he teaches five suffixes tabba, anīya (MV 5.27), ghyan (MV 5.28), ya (MV 5.30), and yak (MV 5.32).

The kicca suffixes are primarily added in the sense of bhāva (an impersonal action) and kamma (an object): bhāvakammesu kiccaktakkhatthā (Kacc 627, Sadd 1232), ${ }^{3}$ bhāvakammesu

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ye paccuyā tabbādayo riccantā te kiccasaññā ti daṭ̣habbā / (Kacc-Vu 547, Sadd 1131)
    2 siddhā evete tabbādayo pesātisaggapattakālesūpi gamyamānesu sāmaññena vidhānuto / (MVu 5.32)
    3 This agrees verbatim with Kt 4.6.47: bhāvakurmaṇoh krtyaktakhalarthāh / Cp. P 3.4.70: tuyor eva kṛtyaktakhalarthāh/
tabbānīyā (MV 5.27). Besides this, they also convey the sense of an order, permission and appropriate time, opportunity, ${ }^{1}$ necessity, or obligation. ${ }^{2}$ According to Mogg, these suffixes are also introduced in the sense of an immediate future with respect to an order, permission and opportunity; deserving, and the capacity of an agent to perform. ${ }^{3}$

# B. 

In Sanskrit, the term $k r t y a$ is the name of the gerundive suffixes tavya, tavyat, anīyar (P 3.1.96), yat (P 3.1.97), nyat (P 3.1.124), kyap (P 3.1.106) and kelimar (vārttika on P 3.1.96.2: kelimara upasañkhyānam).

P 3.1.95: krtyāh prāṅ nvulah teaches that "(the technical term) krtya denotes all affixes (introduced hereafter up to but) excluding nvul and trc (after a verbal stem)".

Śarva's rule defining the technical term krtya is: te krtyāh / (Kt 4.2.46)

C uses tavyādisat for krtya. Cf.: tavyādisațke'vaśyamah / (CV 5.2.90)

1 pesātisaggapattakālesu kiccā (Kacc 637, Sadd 1244); siddhā evete tabbādayo pesātisaggapattakālesūpi gamyamānesu sāmaññena vidhānato (MVu 5.32). Kacc 637, and Sadd 1244 agree verbatim with praisyātisargaprāptakālesu ca (Kt 4.5.110). Cp. P 3.3.163: praisātisargaprāptakālesu krtyāśs ca /
2 āvassakādhaminesu ṇi ca (Kacc 638, Sadd 1245). Kacc 638 and Sadd 1245 are exactly identical with āvaśyakādhamarnayor nin (Kt 4.5.111). Cp. P 3.3.170: āvaśyakādhamarnyayoh ṇiniḥ /
3 evam uddhumuhuttikepi vattamānato pesādisu siddhā eva / tathā arahe kattari sattivisiṭthe ca patīyamāne āvassakādhaminatā visiṭthe ca bhāvādo siddhā / (MVu 5.32)
# C. 

The Pali term kicca is another instance of borrowing from Sanskrit. It is common to the Kacc, the Sadd, the Astt and the Kt. It is, however, missing in the MV and the CV. K and Agg's definition of kicca agrees verbatim with the definition of Śarva.

## 5. vikarana

## A.

The term vikarana is formed from $v i+\operatorname{kar}$ (Skt. $k r$ ) meaning 'to make different, transform'. It is generally used in the grammatical literature to denote the conjugational sign. It is inserted between the root and the suffix or ending, or between the last vowel and the following cosonant of a root. In this sense, vikarana does not occur either in the Canon or in the Aṭthakathās.

K teaches thirteen conjugational signs in rules Kacc 447-454 for the eight classes of verbal roots:

1. $a$ after the roots $b h \bar{u}$ etc.
2. $a$ preceded by a nasal after the roots $r u d h$ etc.
3. ya after the roots div etc.
4. nu, na, una after the roots $s u$ etc.
5. $n \bar{a}$ after the roots $k i$ etc.
6. $p p a, n h a \bar{a}$ after the roots gaha etc.
7. o, yira after the roots tana etc.
8. ne, naya after the roots cura etc.

An additional affix $y a$ in the sense of a passive or an impersonal action is taught by Kacc 442 and Sadd 920.
The word vikarana in the sense of conjugational affixes occurs in the opening verse of the Kacc's Ākhyātakappa:
ākhyātasāgaramathajjatanītarangam
dhātuijialam vikaranāgamakālamīnam /
lopānubandharayamatthavibhāgatīram
dhīrā taranti kavino puthubuddhināvā // $1 / /$
But since, this verse is not commented upon in the Mmd and the Rūp, it is considered as a late interpolation. Apart from this, the term vikarana occurs neither in K's rules nor in the subsequent Vutti. The Vutti simply refers to these affixes as paccayas. ${ }^{1}$ An important point to be noted in this connection is that at Kacc 457 and Sadd 936: dhātuppaccayehi vibhattiyo, ${ }^{2}$ the term dhātuppaccaya is used in the sense of an affix taught with reference to a verbal root. The commentators interpret this term as denoting suffixes starting from $k h a$ up to the causal suffixes, i.e. suffixes taught in Kacc 435-440 and Sadd 906-914. ${ }^{3}$ However, in our opinion, the term may also denote the conjugational affixes as they are inserted between a verbal root and the finite verbal ending.

The mention of the term vikarana is found at the excursus before Rūp 408:
"They (dhātus) are again of seven types according to the difference in the conjugational affixes. How? Bh $\bar{u}$ etc. having the conjugational affix $a$, rudha etc. having the conjugational affix $a$ preceded by a nasal, diva etc. having the conjugational affix $y a, s u$ etc. having the conjugational affixes $n u, n \bar{a}$ and $u n \bar{a}$,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhū iccevamādito dhātuganato appaccayo hoti kuttari (Kacc-Vu 447); divādito dhātuganato yappaccayo hoti kuttari (Kacc-Vu 449) etc.

    2 "The verbal case endings are added after a verbal stem ending in suffixes $k h a$ etc. or the causal suffixes which are taught with reference to a verbal root." (Kacc 457, Sadd 936)

    3 dhātuniddiṭhehi paccayehi khādikāritantehi vibhattiyo honti / (Kacc-Vu 457, Sadd 936)
ki etc. having the conjugational affixes $n \bar{a}, p p a$, and $n h \bar{a}$, tana etc. having the conjugational affix $o$, cura etc. having the conjugational affixes ne and naya in their own sense". ${ }^{1}$

Note that Buddhappiya does not treat roots gaha etc. as a separate class as K does. Here, vikarana is a shorter term for vikaranappaccaya, which is used at Rūp 630.

Agg and Mogg use the term vikarana in the same sense at Sadd 976: vikaranassa ca nuno; MV 5.161: kvaci vikaranānam, MV 6.76: o vikaranassa parachakke. Following K, Agg also teaches thirteen conjugational affixes for eight classes of verbal roots (Sadd 925-933). Mogg, on the other hand, teaches nine conjugational affixes such as:
a. The general conjugational affix $l a$
b. Ni after the roots cur etc. with or without $l a$
c. $L a$ preceded by a nasal after the roots $r u d h$ etc.
d. Yak after the roots div etc.
e. $K a$ after the roots $t u d$ etc.
f. $K n \bar{a}$ after the roots $j i$ etc.
g. Kna after the roots $k i$ etc.
h. Kno after the roots su etc.
i. $O$ after the roots tan etc.

Besides this, MV 5.17: kyo bhāvakammesvupurokkhesu mänantatyädisu teaches the affix kya in the sense of 'an impersonal action' or 'an object'. At MV 5.85: na te känubandhanägamesu, Mogg has used the term ägama to express the conjugational affixes knä etc. Cf. MVu: nägame knädinä /

# B. 

Vikarana in the sense of a conjugational affix is found in the Pāṇinīya Ganapāṭha and the Mbh:
vikaranārtha iti cet, krtäbhihite vikarañäbhāvah (Pāṇinīya Gaṇapāṭha 3.1.67.2)
yadi dhātur viśisyate vikaranasya na präpnoti / (Mbh I.54)

P introduces a number of conjugational affixes such as śap, syan, śa, śnam etc. In Ast, the vikaranas are given under the general heading pratyayah (P 3.1.1). Thus, P regards vikaranas as pratyayas. As a result, the vikarana śnum is also regarded as a suffix, though it does not come at the end of a base.

Commenting on these affixes, Bālamanoramā says:
"The designation vikarana of affixes śap etc. that are stated after a verbal root and precede the finite verbal endings denoted by the abbreviation tin, was established among the ancient teachers". ${ }^{1}$

The word vikarana occurs many times in the rules of the $\mathrm{Kt}^{2}{ }^{2}$ Here too the vikaranas are listed under the general heading pratyayah parah (Kt 3.2.1) and are consequently regarded as suffixes.

The term vikarana is absent in the CV.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tini pare dhātor vihitānām pratyayānām śubādinām vikaranasamjñā prācīnācāryasiddhā / (Si.Kau. 2467)
    2 an-vikaranaḥ kartari (Kt 3.2.32), sandhyakṣarāntānām akāro'vikarane (Kt 3.4.20), nośs ca vikaranāad asamyogāt / (Kt 3.4.35)
# C. 

The Pali grammarians have borrowed the term vikarana from their Sanskrit counterparts. Though the term is missing in the Kacc, it is available in the Sadd and the MV. Mogg's usage of ägama for vikarana has no parallel in other grammars.

## 6. kārita

## A.

Kārita is a past participle from kāreti, the causal form of the root kar. It means 'made to do'. It is an older term denoting a causative suffix or a causal form. In Pali, the term is extant only in the grammatical literature. K , who uses the term for the first time, seems to have taken it over from the Kt .

According to K and Agg, the technical term kārita denotes the causal suffixes ne, naya, ņāpe, and nāpaya which are added after a verbal root in the sense of a causal agent. ${ }^{1}$ Explaining the term kārita, Agg says:
"'The one who makes someone act' is called kāret $\bar{a}$. Who is he? a causal agent. The causal agent (kāretā) itself is called kāritā. And the suffixes ne etc. are called kārita as they convey that sense". ${ }^{2}$

The term kārita is missing in the MV. For K and Agg's gatibuddhibhujapaṭhaharakarasayādīnaṃ kārite vā̄ (Kacc 302,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dhātāhi ṇe-naya-nāpe-nāpayā kāritāni hetvatthe (Kacc 440); ṇe-naya-nāpeṇāpaya hetvatthe dhātuto, kāritā ca te $\ell$ (Sadd 914)
    2 kāretī ti kāretā, ko so: hetubhāto kattā, kāretā eva kāritā, taddīpakattā nādayo paccayā kāritā / (Sadd 914)
    3 "The second case terminations are added when the causal forms of the verbal roots having the sense of 'motion', 'knowledge', and the roots bhuj, paṭh, har, kar, si etc. are used".
Sadd 587), following C, Mogg has gatibodhāhārasaddatthakammakabhajjādīnam payojje / ${ }^{1}$ (MV 2.4)

# B. 

In the Nir (1.7, 8, 17; 4.2; 5.23), Y uses the terms kārita, cikīrsita and carkarīta to denote various categories of verbal inflections. There, kārita signifies the causative inflection. The term is, however, missing in P's Ast. P uses $n i$, which is a causal suffix, instead of the bigger term kārita. Cf. P 1.4.52: gatibuddhipratyavasānārthaśabdakarmākarmakānām aṇi kartā sa nau/

Śarva, on the other hand, has retained the older term kārita: in kāritam dhātvarthe / (Kt 3.2.9)

C has avoided the use of the term kārita. Thus, for P's gatibuddhipratyavasānārthaśabdakarmākarmakānām ani kartā sa ṇau (P 1.4.52), C has gatibodhāhāraśabdārthānāpyānām prayojye / (CV 2.1.44)

## C.

Thus, with regard to the term kārita, K and Agg have followed Śarva. Mogg, on the other hand, has followed C.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 'The second case terminations are added in the sense of 'an instigated agent' (payojja kattā) of the verbal roots having the sense of 'motion', 'knowledge', 'eating or drinking', 'producing sound', of intransitive roots and of the verbal roots bhajj etc.".
# Terminology Denoting Parts of Speech 

## 1. nāma

## A.

The literal meaning of the term nāma is 'a name'. Sometimes, it is also used to denote 'a word' in general. Cf. Sp 223, 22-24. ${ }^{1}$ However, in the grammatical context, the word is generally used to denote nouns.

The Pali grammarians generally derive the word nāma from the root nam 'to bend'. Thus, the concluding verse of the Sadd's nāmakappa runs:
"Let the wise people bend their mind over those nominal words which bend over the meaning and make the meaning bend over them". ${ }^{2}$
Also cp. the Kacc-Vṇ on Kacc 318:
"They bend over the meanings. Thus, they are called nouns. Or, they make the meaning bend over them. Thus, they are nouns". ${ }^{3}$

Commenting on Kacc 318: nāmānaṃ samāso yuttattho, Kacc-Vṇ enumerates five types of nouns:
"Nouns are of tive types. Thus, it is said:
"Knowers of nouns declare nouns to be of five types: simple nouns, pronouns, compounds,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 vuttam pi c'etam: sikkhāpadam ti yo tattha nāmakāyo, padakāyo, niruttikāyo, vyañjanakāyo ti /
    2 namanti yāni atthesu atthe nāmenti c' attani /
    padesu, tesu nāmesu dhīrā nāmentu mänasam //
    3 atthesu numantī ti nāmāni, atha vā atthe nāmentī ti nāmāni/
secondary derivatives, and similarly, primary derivatives". ${ }^{1}$

Note that prefixes and particles are included in the category of simple nouns. ${ }^{2}$

Another word used by the Pali grammarians to denote a simple noun is suddhanāma. Cf. excursus before Sadd 751 (p. 782):
"However, some say that the word purisā, which is an instance of 'part retaining', is not a secondary derivative but rather a simple noun". ${ }^{3}$
Also cp. Kacc-Vn 63:
suttāgatānam etimāsaddānam etimāsaddasānu-
karanattā sabbanāmānukaraṇassa ca suddhanāma-
sabhāvato suddhanāme ādesavasena etimātaṃ ti vattabbam /

K and Agg have used the word nāma in the sense of 'a noun' at Kacc 318: nāmānaṃ samāso yuttattho, Sadd 199: syādayo nāme, tyādayo ākhyāte, and Sadd 675: nāmopasagganipātānaṃ yuttattho samāso. However, at Kacc 603, it appears to have been used in the sense of 'a nominal root'. Note that Mogg has also used the word nāma in this sense. Cf. MV 1.9: iyuvannā jhalā nāmassante. Also cp. MVu 1.9: nāmam pātipadikam "nāma means a nominal root".

Mogg has used the word nāma in the sense of 'a proper name'. Cf. for instance, MV 2.141; 4.9, and 4.16. In his grammar, the term denoting a noun is syādyanta. Cf. MV 3.1: syādi syādinekattham, MVu 3.1: syādyantaṃ syādyantena sahekattham hoti / However, at MV 5.12, the term nāma has been used to denote 'a noun'.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 nāmanāmaṃ sabbanāmaṃ samāsaṃ taddhitaṃ tathā / kitanāmañca nāmaññā nāmam pañcavidhaṃ vade //
    2 tattha nāmanāmaṃ nāma upasagganipātā / (Kacc-Vṇ 318)
    3 keci pana ... purisā ti katekasesapadam paccayarahitattā na taddhitapadam, suddhanāmapadaṃ yevā ti vadanti /
# B. 

The usage of the term näman in the sense of 'a noun' goes back to the time of the Go. Brā:
omkāram prcchāmah ko dhātuh, kim prātipadikam, kim nāmākhyātam / (1.1.24)
Y also uses the word in the same sense. Cf.:
"Now, what (are) the four classes of words? They are the following: noun and verb; preposition and particles." ${ }^{1}$
He defines näman as "Nouns have 'being' as their fundamental notion." ${ }^{2}$

In the grammars of P and C , nouns are generally referred to as subantas i.e. words ending in the nominal inflections. However, at P 4.3.72: dvyajrdbrāhmaṇarkprathamādhvarapuraścarunanāmākhyātāt ṭhak, näman is also used in the sense of 'a noun'.

Śarva also uses the term näman in the same sense. Cf. Kt 2.5.1: nämnāṃ samāso yuktārthah /

## C.

Thus, the term näma in the sense of 'a noun' is common to both the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammarians.

## 2. sabbanāma

## A.

Sabbanāma is a good old term denoting 'a pronoun'. It is a self-explanatory term meaning 'the name for all':

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tad yāni catvāri padajātāni nāmākhyāte copasarganipātāś ca tānīmāni bhavanti / (Nir 1.1)
    2 sattvapradhānāni nāmāni / (Nir 1.1)
"Names for all; feminine, masculine and neuter are sabbanāma." ${ }^{1}$

Note that this analysis is already met with in the Mbh where Ptj says:
"That which is a name for all is called sarvanāman 'a pronoun'." ${ }^{2}$

Also cp. DT 2.1.25:
sarveṣān nāma sarvanāma ity anvarthasamjjñay $\bar{a}$ sarvādayo grhyante /

With respect to Pali, the term sabbanāma has no canonical background. Kacc-Vn acknowledges that sabbanāma is a borrowed term: sabbanāmaṃ ti parasamaññā / (Kacc-Vṇ 164)

The term sabbanāma occurs for quite a number of times in Kacc. ${ }^{3}$ Sabbanāmikam, which is a taddhita form of the term, also occurs at Kacc 166: nāññam sabbanāmikam / Once more, the influence of Sarva is quite evident here. Cp. Kt 2.1.33: nānyat sāvanāmikam / K has not attempted any formal definition of the term. He here seems to follow the practice of Sarva.

At Sadd 269, Agg defines sabbanāma as: sabbakatarādayo sabbanämäni /
"The technical term sabbanāma applies to words sabba, katara etc.".

This definition goes close to P 1.1.27: sarvādīni sarvanämäni / Kacc-Vn on Kacc 164: sabbanämakärate paṭhamo quotes stanzas recording a number of pronouns. They are:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sabbesam itthīyumanapuṃsakānaṃ nämäni sabbanämäni / (Rüp 200)
    2 sarveṣạ̣̄ yan nāma tat sarvanāma / (Mbh I.88)
    3 sabbanāmānaṃ namhi ca (Kacc 102), tratha sattamiyā sabbanāmehi / (Kacc 251)
"Sabba, katara, katama, ubhaya, itara, aññatara, aññatama, pubba, apara, dakkhiṇa, uttara ${ }^{1}$, para, añña, ya, ta, eta, amu, ima, kim, tumha, amha, numerals eka, dvi, ti, catu, pañca, cha, satta, attha, nava, dasa, vīsa upto infinity". ${ }^{2}$

A similar but shorter list of pronouns also occurs at MVu 2.101:
sabba, katara, katama, ubhaya, itara, añña, aññatara, aññatama; pubbaparāparadakkhiṇuttarādharāni vavatthāyam asaññāyam /

Also cp. excursus between Rūp 199 and 200.
Following C, Mogg uses sabbādi for sabbanāma. ${ }^{3}$ Thus, for sabbanāmānam namhi ca (Kacc 102) and sabbanāmānam pana namhi (Sadd 270), Mogg has sabbādīnam namhi ca / (MV 2.101)

# B. 

The first occurrence of the term sarvanāman in its technical sense can be traced back to the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra (1.4.20):
sarvanāmnā striyo rājanyavaiśyau ca, na nāmnā/4
In Nir 1.7, besides sarvanāman Y uses ardhanāman probably denoting a partial pronoun:

1 Note that these pronouns (pubba, apara, dakkhiṇa and uttara) denoting directions are called disāsabbanāma by Agg: hoti disāsabbanāmānam. (Sadd 352)
2 sabbaṃ katara-katama-ubhaya-itarā pi ca /
aññatara-aññatama-pubba-apara-dakkhinā //
uttara-para-aññā ca ya-ta-eta-amu-imā /
kim-tumha-amha-ekā va dvi-ti-catu ca pañca cha /
satta atṭha nava dasa vīsādi yāva samkhyā'ti // (Kacc-Vṇ 164)
3 sabbādito sabbā (MV 2.25), sabbādito sattamyā tratthā / (MV 4.99)
4 "Women as well as kṣatriyas and vaiśyas are to be saluted by means of the name common to all i.e. pronoun and not by (means of one's proper) name".
"The word tva, being a pronoun with the sense of 'opposition', is unaccented. Some hold it to be a partial pronoun". ${ }^{1}$
At Nir 4.6, Y uses the term samkhyānāman for numerals:
"Trita was the one most eminent in wisdom. Or else the word may have been intended as a synonym of number, i.e. ekatah, dvitah, tritah, thus, the three were produced". ${ }^{2}$

P defines sarvanāman as: sarvādīni sarvanāmāni / (P 1.1.27)
"(The technical term) sarvanāman 'pronominal stem' denotes the class of nominal bases whose first member is sarva- 'all'."

The words occurring in this sarvādi group are: sarva, viśva, ubha, ubhaya, datara, datama, katara, katama, itara, anya, anyatara, tva, nema, sama, sima, pūrya, para, avara, daksina, uttara, apara, adhara, sva, antara, tyad, tad, yad, etad, idam, adas, eka, dvi, yusmad, asmad, bhavatu and kim.

Note that at P 2.3.29, P uses dikśabda for pronouns denoting directions: anyārāditarariedikśabdāñcūttarapadājāhiyukte whereas at P 2.2.26, P uses diñnāman for the same: diinnāmāny antarāle / Under P 6.4.174.4, Ptj says:
ekaśrutih svarasarvanāma, yathā napuṃsakaṃ
lingasarvanāma / (Mbh III.234)
Here sarvanāman is used in the sense of 'general'.
Sarva uses the term without defining it: sarvanämnas tu sasavo hrasvapūrvāś ca (Kt 2.1.43), and smai sarvanāmnah / (Kt 2.1.25)

C uses sarvādi: sarvādibhyah smaismatau / (CV 2.1.6)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 tva iti vinigrahārthīyaṃ sarvanāmānudāttam / ardhanāmety eke /
    2 tritus tīrnatamo medhayā babhūva / api vā saṃkhyā nāmaivābhipretaṃ syāt / ekato dvitastrita iti trayo babhūvuh /
# C. 

With respect to the usage of the term sabbanāma, K and Agg have followed P and Sarva. Agg's definition of sabbanāma seems to be motivated by P as no other source seems to be more probable. Mogg's choice of the term sabbādi is, no doubt, influenced by C.

## 3. visesana

## A.

The term visesana meaning 'distinguishing, distinction, qualification, attribute' is derived from $v i+s i s .{ }^{1}$ In the grammatical context, it signifies an adjective. In this sense, the term is used in all the three Pali grammars. Cf. visesane ca (Kacc 294); visesane pakatiädisu ca (Sadd 604) and visesanam ekatthena (MV 3.11).

Agg explains the term as:
"Visesana (a qualifier) is that by which something that ought to be distinguished is distinguished". ${ }^{2}$

The Pali grammarians have used only one term to express a qualifier. They have, however, used three different words to express the qualified. Agg has used visesitabba at Sadd 613: visesanavisesitabbānaṃ va sambandhānaṃ sambandho and visesanīya at Sadd 688: ayuttattho yuttattho vā visesunīyavisesane. Here it should be noted that visesitabbavacana occurs at Vv-a 13 in the sense of qualifying (predicative) expression. Besides this, in Pali, there are words such as visesita (Mhvs 11, 32; Pj I 18), visesiya (Vv $16^{10}$ ), visesin and visesavant. Mogg uses visessa at MVu 3.11: visesanaṃ syādyantam, visessena syādyantena samānādhikaraṇena sahekattham hoti / It seems to be formed after the Sanskrit form viśesya.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Vv $16^{10}$; Ja III.11; VI.63; Pj II 181; Vv-a 13.
    2 visesīyuti visesitabbam anenā ti visesanam / (Sadd 604)
# B. 

In the Sanskrit grammars, the term denoting an adjective is viśesaña and the term denoting that which is qualified is viśesya. Cf. viśesañam viśesyeña bahulam (P 2.1.57), viśesañānām ca ajāteḥ (P 1.2.52); viśesanae (Kt 2.4.32); viśesañam ekārthena (CV 2.2.18).

## C.

The term visesana in the sense of an adjective is common to both the Sanskrit and the Pali grammars.

## 4. abyaya

## A.

The literal meaning of the term avyaya ${ }^{1}$ is 'absence of loss or change' (D I.72). In the grammatical context, it denotes a class of indeclinables including prefixes and particles. Cf. Rüp 321:
"There, avyaya is a term denoting prefixes and particles on account of its being free from loss / change even when the gender or number varies". ${ }^{2}$

The term avyaya does not occur independently in Kacc. At Kacc 321: upasagganipātapubbako abyayībhāvo, abyaya occurs as a part of a compound abyayībhāva.

At Sadd 695, avyaya is defined as: upasagganipātā avyayā /
"The term avyaya denotes prefixes and particles".
Commenting on the rule, Agg says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Note that K uses abyaya which is a phonetic variant of avyaya.
    2 tattha abyayam iti upasagganipātānaṃ saññā lingavacanabhede pi vyayarahitattā/
"Prefixes and particles are designated as indeclinables in the sense of the absence of loss on account of their unaltered nature with respect to all the genders, cases and numbers except in the sandhi operation, compounding, and the secondary derivation". ${ }^{1}$

Agg supports his explanation by quoting a verse, which is a Pali version of a popular Sanskrit verse:
"The words, which do not decline, in all the three genders and in all the cases and numbers they are called avyayas 'indeclinables'". ${ }^{2}$
Cp. Go. Brā. 1.1.26, Mbh I. 96 and DT 2.4.4:
sadṛsaṃ triṣu lin̄geṣu sarvāsu ca vibhaktissu /
vacaneṣu ca sarveṣu yan na vyeti tad avyayam //
Avyaya is missing in the MV. Following C, Mogg uses asamkhya for avyaya. Cf. asamkhyehi sabbāsam / (MV 2.120)
"Any case ending coming after an indeclinable is elided."

MVu here paraphrases asamkhyehi with avijjamānasamkhyehi 'the one without a number'. In this connection, it is interesting to note that DV on Kt 2.4.4: avyayāc ca says: avyayam asamkhyam 'Avyaya means asamkhya'. DT comments:
"That which does not decline is called an avyaya. That which does not have a number is called asamkhya. It is a synonym (of avyaya)."3

[^0]
[^0]:    1 upasagganipātā vinā ekaccam sandhikiccam samāsakiccam taddhitakiccam ca sabbesu pi lingavibhattivacanesu avitathattā vināsābhāvena avyayasaññā honti / (Sadd 695)
    2 vyayo tīsu ca lingesu sabbāsu ca vibhattisu / yesaṃ n' atthi padānan tu, tāni vuccanti avyayā // (Sadd 695)
    3 na vyetīty avyayam / na vidyate samkhyā yasyety asamkhyàm paryāyah kathyate /
# B. 

The term avyaya in its technical sense probably occurred for the first time in the Go. Brā. (1.1.26):
sadṛśaṃ triṣu lingesu sarvāsu ca vibhaktiṣu /
vacaneṣu ca sarveṣu yan na vyeti tadavyayam //1
This is expanded in Mbh I. 96 as:
"That which does not decline is called an avyaya, then where does it not decline? Being feminine, masculine and neuter are the qualities of a substance and so also the quality of singularity, duality and plurality. With respect to these meanings, some words decline, some do not. Those which do not decline are called indeclinables". ${ }^{2}$

P does not define avyayas. He simply enumerates them in P 1.1.37: svarādinipātam avyayam ${ }^{3}$ and the following rules. According to these rules, avyaya embraces nipāta, gati, upasarga, karmapravacanīya and other indeclinables.

Śarva uses the term at Kt 2.2.64: avyayasarvanāmnah svarād antyāt pūrvo'k kah and at Kt 2.4.4: avyayāc ca.

C uses asamkhya for avyaya and sasaṃkhya for anavyaya. Cf. CV 2.2.2: asamkhyaṃ vibhaktisamīpabhāvakhyātipaścādyathā-

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "That which remains the same and does not decline in all the three genders, in all the cases and in all the numbers, is called an avyaya 'an indeclinable'".

    2 na vyetīty avyayam iti / kva punar na vyeti? strīpunnapuṃsakāni sattvaguṇā ekutvadvitvabahutvāni ca / etān arthān kecid viyanti, kecin na viyanti / ye na viyanti tad avyayam /

    3 "(The technical term) avyaya 'indeclinable' denotes members of the class headed by svar- as well as particles."
yugapatsampatsākalyārthe, CV 6.4.40: atah krkamikamsakumbhapātrakuśākarṇīu sasaṃkhyasya.

# C. 

To sum up, the term avyaya does not occur independently in the Kacc. Agg as usual seems to follow Sarva among other possible sources. Mogg seems to follow C but the influence of the DV and the DT in the selection of the term asamkhya cannot be totally ruled out.

## 5. upasagga, nipāta

## A.

Upasarga and nipāta would appear to be older terms than avyaya, since it is not mentioned in the traditional enumeration of parts of speech, viz., nāman, ākhyāta, upasarga and nipāta.

The term upasagga is derived from the root sajja with the prefix upa. In Pali, upasagga is used in its technical as well as its non-technical sense. Upasagga in its technical sense of 'a prefix' occurs at Ja II.67, 126; Sv I.245; Pj I 101; Pv-a 88; As 163. In its non-technical sense of 'attack, danger' etc. upasagga occurs at Vin I.33; A I.101; Th 2.353 etc.

The term nipāta is derived from $n i+$ pat. The literal meaning of the term is 'falling down, descending'. However, as a technical term of grammar, it denotes a particle, the grammatical term for adverbs, conjunctions and interjections (Ja V.243; Pv-a 11, 26, 40, 50). From the grammarians' point of view, prefixes and particles are a part of a broader category of indeclinables. ${ }^{1}$ They are also reckoned as two out of four parts of speech, the other two being nāma and $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$. The Pali atthakathās mention four parts of

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Cf. Sadd 695: Upasagganipāt $\bar{a}$ avyay $\bar{a}$ "The term avyaya (an indeclinable) denotes prefixes and particles".
speech (padavibhāga) viz. nāmapada, ākhyātapada, upasaggapada and nipātapada. Cf. Sv 26, 9ff (on D I 1.4).

The Pali grammarians have analysed the terms upasagga and nipāta as:
"Pa etc ${ }^{1}$ are called prefixes (upasaggas) as going close they add to the meaning. $C a$ etc. ${ }^{2}$ are called particles (nipātas) as they fall at the beginning or in the middle or at the end of a $p \bar{a} d a$ (a quarter of a stanza)". ${ }^{3}$

Note that a similar explanation is already met with in the writings of Skanda:
"Going close they add i.e. they make the meaning of nouns and verbs distinct. Thus they are called upasargas." ${ }^{4}$

In Mogg's grammar, upasaggas are called pādi (pa etc.) and nipātas are called cādi (ca etc.). Cf. MV 5.131: pādito ṭhāssa vā thaho kvaci, ${ }^{5}$ MVu 2.239: cādīyoge tumha amha saddānamādesā

1 Kacc-Vu (on Kacc 221: subbāsamāvusopasagganipātādīhi ca) provides a list of twenty upasaggas beginning with pa: pa, parā, ni, nī, u, dū, sum, vi, ava, anu, pari, adhi, abhi, pati, su, $\bar{a}$, ati, api, apa, and upa. MVu 5.131 provides almost the same list. The only difference being that MVu has the prefix $o$ instead of $n \bar{\imath}$.

2 Nipātas beginning with ca are: yathā, tathā, evam, khalu, kho, yatra, tatra, atho, atha, hi, tu, ca, vā, vo, hum, alam, eva, bho, aho, he, re, are, hare etc. (Kacc-Vu on Kacc 221)

3 upecc attham sajjantī ti upasaggā hi pādayo /
cādi pādādimajjhante nipātā nipatantī hi // (Rūp 282)
4 upetya nāmākhyātayor arthasya viśeṣaṃ srjanty utpādayantīty upasargāh / (Skanda on Nir 1.3)

5 "The verbal root ṭh $\bar{a}$ coming after the (prefixes) pa etc. is sometimes substituted by thaha".
na honti. ${ }^{1}$ The term nipāta is, however, used at MVu 1.32: yathariva tathariveti nipātovā, 2.148: bho iti āmantane nipāto and 3.17: atthisaddo vijjumānatthe nipāto /

Explaining the nature of prefixes, Rūp says:
"The behaviour of the upasaggus is threefold: some cancel the meaning of a verbal root. Others follow it whereas some others change the very meaning (of a verbal root)." ${ }^{2}$

This is a Pali version of a popular Sanskrit verse occurring in the Śākaṭāyana Dhātupāṭha:
dhātvartham bādhate kaścit kaścit tam anuvartate /
tam eva višinaṣti anya upasargagatis tridhā //
At MVu 5.131, Mogg says that the prefixes manifest a particular action: pādīhi kriyāvisesajotakehi ... Cp. kriyāviśeṣakā upasargāh / (Kātyāyana 1.3.1.7)

About nipätas, Rūp 282 says:
"That which is independent of other three types of speech ${ }^{3}$ and hence falls in the middle, and which bears the characteristic of an indeclinable, that is called the one belonging to the category of particles (nipätas)."4

1 "When the pronouns tumha and amha are syntactically connected with the particles $c a$ etc. then there occurs no substitute in their place".

2 dhātrattham bādhate koci koci tam anuvattate / tamevañño viseseti upasaggagati tidhā // (Rūp 282)

3 Particles are said to be different than the remaining three parts of speech such as nouns, verbs and prefixes: nāmākhyātopasaggavinimmuttam / (Rūp 282)

4 muttam padattayā tasmā nipatatyuntarantarā / nepātikanti taṃ vuttam yam avyayasalakkhanam //
Following the Nirukta way of classification, Rūp also classifies particles into four categories such as conjunctive, disjunctive, prohibitive and expletive. This classification is based on various non-substantival meanings conveyed by these particles. Out of the above-mentioned four categories, the expletive particles are further subdivided into two: those accomplishing the meaning and those accomplishing the number of syllables in a sentence or a stanza. Particles such as atha, khalu, bata, seyyathīdam belong to the second category of expletives. Particles accomplishing the meaning are again of two types: the one with case endings and the one without case endings. ${ }^{1}$

Though the prefixes and particles are called avyayas, according to the Pali grammarians, they are still inflected. Cf. Sadd 203, "The case terminations are added after a conventional word, an imitative word, and prefixes." ${ }^{2}$ In view of Rūp, prefixes only take the nominative singular suffix for they are not related with the concept of number and kāraka. ${ }^{3}$ However, at the final stage, these added case endings are dropped. Cf.: Kacc 221; Sadd 448; and MV 2.120. Commenting on Sadd 448, Agg points out that according to the grammarians, in case of prefixes and particles, there is no possibility of dropping of the plural suffixes as they are called asamkhya (without number). However, as per the sāsanikas, the elision of plural suffixes is still possible. ${ }^{4}$ In the same context, the Kacc-Vṇ says:

1 Cf. Rūp 282: sabbāsamāvusopasagganipātādīhi ca /
2 rāfhānukaraṇopasaggādito ca /
3 tattha upasaggānaṃ nāmākhyātavisesakattā lingasaññāyam aniyamena syādimhi sampatte tesaṃ saṃkhyākammādibhedābhāvā tehi paṭhamekavacanameva bhavati / (Rūp 282)
4 saddasatthavidā asamkhyasaddattā upasagganipātehi bahuvacanalopam na icchanti, sāsanikā pana icchanti; tathā hi sāsane asamkhyasaddato pi bahuvacanalopo icchitabbo hoti / (Sadd 448)
"After prefixes, the nominative singular suffix, whereas after particles, fourteen case endings are elided". ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

Upasarga from upa 'near' and srj 'to discharge' literally means 'discharged near', then 'addition', then 'addition to the verb' i.e. 'preposition'. Cf. Durgasimha on Nir 1.3:
"It means that they (upasargas) embrace the $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a s$ and produce a specific meaning of the same". ${ }^{2}$

Upasarga and nipāta occur in Nir 1.3 signifying two parts of speech. Y mentions twenty upasargas with their meanings in the following order:

| $\bar{a}$ | Hitherward | sam | Together |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| pra and par $\bar{a}$ | Opposite of <br> hitherward | $v i$ and <br> apa | Opposite of <br> together |
| abhi | Towards | anu | Similarity and <br> succession |
| prati | opposite of <br> towards | api | Commingling |
| ati and su | Honoured | upa | Accession |
| nir and dur | opposite of | pari | Around |

1 upasaggato hi pathamekavacanam ca nipātato pana cuddasu vibhattiyo luttā hontī ti / (Kacc-Vn 221)
2 ākhyātam upagrhyārthaviśesam ime tasyaira srjantīty arthah/
|  | honoured |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ni and ava | Downwards | adhi | Above, <br> supremacy |
| ud | Opposite of <br> downwards |  |  |

Nipāta is derived from $n i+$ pat. It is explained thus in Nir:
"Now, the particles occur in various senses, both in a comparative sense, in a conjunctive sense, and as expletives". ${ }^{1}$

At P 1.4.59, P explains upasarga as: upasargāh kriyāyoge
"(The technical term) upasarga 'preverb, preposition' denotes (the group of particles beginning with pra-) when there is a connection with an action".

Since an upasarga is primarily connected with a verb, Kātyāyana says in his vārttika: kriyāviśeṣakā upasargāh (1.3.1.7). Under P 2.1.1, Ptj says:
"Such is the nature of upasargas that where a word denoting an action (i.e. a verb) is used, they express the special character of an action". ${ }^{2}$

P does not provide any descriptive definition of nipāta. According to P 1.4.56: prāg rīśvarān nipātāh /
1 atha nipātāh uccāvacesv artheṣu nipatanti / apy upamārthe / api karmopasañgrahārthe / api padapūranāh / (Nir 1.4)
2 upasargāś ca punar evamātmakā yatra kuścit kriyāvācī śabdaḥ prayujyate tatra kriyāviśeṣam āhuh /
"(The technical term) nipāta 'particle' denotes elements specified in the subsequent rules preceding (the sūtra adhirīśvare 1.4.97)."

Śarva uses upasarga and nipāta without defining them, e.g., yamimadigadām tv anupasarge (Kt 4.2.13), odantā a i u ā nipātäh svare prakrtyā (Kt 1.3.1). Durga, the commentator, explains it thus:
"They have a firm placement (in a particular meaning). Cādis, which are not capable of conveying the meaning in their own capacity, are established as indeclinables. Further, somebody says, 'nipātas (are so called because they) are used in the sense which is not different from that of nouns and verbs". ${ }^{1}$

C uses prādi for upasarga. Cf.: kuprādayo' subvidhau nityam (CV 2.2.24). CVṛ uses cavādi for nipātas. Cf.: cavādibhir yoge yuṣmadasmador ādeśā na bhavanti / (CVṛ 6.3.22)

# C. 

K and Agg have borrowed the terms upasagga and nipāta from the Sanskrit grammars. Mogg has followed C as he has used pādi for upasagga and cādi for nipātas. From the overall similarity of the explanation and classification of upasagga and nipāta, it is quite evident that the Pali grammarians have taken a lot of help from their Sanskrit counterparts.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 niścitaḥ pāta eṣām iti nipātāh / arthābhidhāneṣu svakriyāyām asamarthāś cādayo avyayāh siddhāh / tathā cāha - nāmākhyātaprayogeṣv arthād abhinnā nipatantīti nipātāh /
# 6. kammappavacanīya 

## A.

Kammappavacanīya is a purely grammatical term. It occurs neither in the Canon nor in the subsequent Aṭthakathā literature. It is quite conspicuous that the Pali grammarians have borrowed it from the Sanskrit grammars.

K uses kammappavacanīya at Kacc 301: kammappavacanīyayutte, without defining it.

At Sadd 582, Agg defines kammappavacanīya thus:
anvādidhirādayo kammappavacanīy $\bar{a}$ /
"The prefixes anu etc. ${ }^{1}$ and the particles $d h i$ etc. ${ }^{2}$ are called kammappavacanīyas". ${ }^{3}$

Here it should be noted that the Sanskrit grammarians do not treat the particles dhik (Pali dhi) etc. as karmapravacanīyas. However, we learn from DT on Kt 2.4.22: dvitīyainena, that in the Āpiśalīya system of grammar, samay $\bar{a}$, nikaṣā and other indeclinables governing the accusative case were regarded as karmapravacanīyas. ${ }^{4}$ Further in the commentary, Agg explains the term kammappavacanīya as:
"Kammappavacanīyas are so called as an action is to be indicated by them". ${ }^{5}$

Kacc-Vn analyses the same term as:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Anu etc. include prefixes anu, pati, pari, abhi.
    2 Dhi etc. include dhi, antarā, abhito.
    3 anuādayo upasaggā dhiādayo nipātā ca kammappavacanīyasaññā honti /
    4 Āpiśalīyavyākaraṇe samayādīnām karmapravacanīyatvaṃ dṛ̣̣tam iti matam /
    5 kammam pavacanīyaṃ yesan te kammappavacanīy $\bar{a} /$
"The action is expressed by these. Thus, they are called kammappavacanīyas." ${ }^{1}$

Mogg as usual avoids this term but mentions its particular cases in MV 2.10 - 2.17.

# B. 

Karmapravacanīya is probably the longest technical term in the Sanskrit grammar. It is found in the Prātisāāhyas of the Atharva Veda:
anarthakakarmapravacanīyāny ayuktair vigraho'bhivitanvādiṣu / (CA 4.3)

It is evidently derived from karmapravacana with the secondary suffix $\bar{i} y a$ and literally means 'concerned with the setting forth of an action'. DT on Kt 2.4.23: karmapravacanīyais ca, explains karmapravacanīya thus:
"Those that have set forth an action are karmapravacanīyas with the suffix anīya added in the sense of a past agent. It is a term established by the popular usage". ${ }^{2}$

Explaining the nature of the karmapravacanīyas, the Vākya says:
"It is not indicative of an action, nor is it denotative of a relation, nor does it imply another verb. However, it distinguishes a certain relation." ${ }^{3}$

P refrains from giving any descriptive definition of karmapravacanīya. His rule P 1.4.83: karmapravacanīyāh simply

[^0]
[^0]:    1 kammam pavuccati imehī ti kammappavacanīyā / (Kacc-Vn 301)
    2 karma kriyām proktavantah karmapravacanīyāh /
    kartary atīte'bhidhānād anīyapratyayah / lokopacārāt siddheyaṃ saṃjñā /
    3 kriyāyā dyotako nāyaṁ sambandhasya na vācakaḥ /
    nāpi kriyāpadāksepī sambandhasya tu bhedakaḥ//(2.204)
says that the term karmapravacanīya applies to whatever is taught in the subsequent section (1.4.83-1.4.98).

Śarva uses karmapravacanīya in the rule karmapravacanīyais $c a$ (Kt 2.4.23) without defining it.

Although C has not used the term, he has dealt with all the particular cases of karmapravacanīyas. Cf.: CV 2.1.54-2.1.61.

# C. 

To sum up, the Pali grammarians have borrowed the term kammappavacanīya from Sanskrit. Just as Sarva, K uses the term without defining it. Agg differs from the Sanskrit grammarians on the point that he also includes the indeclinables like dhi etc. within the scope of the kammappavacanīyas. Just as C, Mogg avoids the use of this term.

## 7. $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$

## A.

$\bar{A} k h y \bar{a} t a$ literally means 'that which has been described fully', then it came to mean 'that which describes fully i.e., a finite verb'. At Sv 26, 9ff (on D I 1.4) Buddhaghosa uses the term $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a p a d a$ to denote a finite verb. However, at Vv-a 315, the term kiriyāpada, i.e. that which supplies an action, is used for a finite verb.

The third chapter of Kacc is named $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a k a p p a$. The term also occurs in the two opening verses of that chapter:
$\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a s a ̄ g a r a m a t h a j j a t a n i t a r a n ̄ g a m$
dhātujjalaṃ vikaraṇāgamakālamīnam /
lopānubandharayamatthavibhāgatīram
dhīrā taranti kavino puthubuddhināvā // I //
vicittasañkhāraparikkhitam imam
ākhyātasaddaṃ vipulam asesato /
panamya sambuddhamanantagocaram
sugocaram yaṃ vadato sunātha me // 2 //
Commenting on these, the Kacc-Vṇ says:
"There, that which expresses an action is an $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$, or a kiriyāpada (a finite verb). It expresses time, syntactic relations between a noun and a verb, person, and action and it is characterized by an action. ... As it is said thus: that which has three tenses, and three persons, that which expresses an action, and three kāraka relations, that which is without three genders, and has two numbers, that is called an $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$, a finite verb". ${ }^{1}$

However, the word itself is not used by K in any of his rules.
Agg uses the term $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$ in rules Sadd 199; 448; 676; 685; 931; 990; and 1102 in the sense of a finite verb.

The term is missing in the rules of MV. MVu, however, uses $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$ and $t y \bar{a} d y a n t a$ to express a finite verb. Cf.:
"In the sentence odano paccati 'the rice is being cooked' the kāraka relation kamma is not understood from the word odana. Then how? from the finite verb ". ${ }^{2}$
"The meaning is comprehended by it, thus it is called a pada, an inflected form ending either in the

1 tattha kiriyam ācikkhatī ti ākhyātaṃ kiriyāpadam; tañca kālakārakapurisa-
kiriyāparidīpakaṃ kiriyālakkhaṇañca ... vuttañca -
yantikālaṃ tipurisam kriyāvāci tikārakam /
attilingaṃ dvivacanaṃ tadālhyātaṃ ti vuccati //
2 odano paccatīti - odanasaddato kammatā nappatīyate, kiṃ carahi? $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a t o /(\mathrm{MVu} 2.2)$
nominal case endings si etc. or the verbal case endings $t i$ etc.". ${ }^{1}$

# B. 

In Nir 1.1 and BD 2.121, äkhyāta is defined as bhāvapradhānam i.e. 'having, becoming or action as its fundamental meaning'. The statement: tatra nāmāny äkhyātajānīti Śākatāayano nairuktasamayaśs ca² (Nir 1.12) indicates that the predecessors of Y appear to have used the word $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$ either exclusively in the sense of a root or both in the sense of roots and finite verbs. It is interesting to note that in later times, dhātu was substituted for $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$ here and we find in the Mbh:
nāma ca dhātujam āha nirukte vyākaraṇe Śakaṭasya ca tokam / (II.138)

In tribhya äkhyātebhyo jāyata iti Śākapūnīh (Nir 7.14), ākhyāta seems to have been used in the sense of roots.

The word is not used by P as a technical term in Ast though it occurs in P's rule: dvyajrtbrāhmaṇarkprathamādhvarapuraścaran̄anāmākhyātāt ṭhak (P 4.3.72) and in the Gaṇasūtra: ākhyāatam $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t e n a$ kriyāsātatye ${ }^{3}$ on P 2.1.72. In P's system, verbs are generally referred to as tinanta. Cf. suptinantam padam / ${ }^{4}$

In the Kt , the third chapter is known as $\bar{a} k h y a ̄ t a$, but the word itself does not appear to have been used by Śarva. Commentators generally explain the word thus:

1 pajjatenenatthoti padam, syādyantaṃ tyādyantaṃ ca / (MVu 2.234)
2 "With reference to this, Śākaṭāyana holds that nouns are derived from verbs. This, too, is the doctrine of the etymologists".

3 "A verb is compounded with a verb in order to express a continuous action".
4 "(The technical term) pada denotes an item terminating in (nominal ending) sup or ( $l$-substitute) tin triplet". (P 1.4.14)
"The finite verbal endings $t i$ etc., which are well described i.e. are prominently set forth, are called $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a s " .{ }^{1}$

According to this view, $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ means verbal endings.
Following P, C also uses tinanta for finite verbs.

# C. 

The terms $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ and kiriyāpada occur simultaneously in Pali Atṭhakathās in the sense of a finite verb. Out of these, the Pali grammarians have adopted $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$. MVu uses tyādyanta besides $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$.

## 8. vippakata

## A.

Vippakata which is derived from $v i+p a+k a r$ literally means 'imperfectly executed, left unfinished, interrupted' (D I.2; Vin II.172; A II. 196 etc.). In grammar, terms vippakata or vippakatavacana are used of words denoting an incomplete action. In this sense, it is only used by Agg. Cf. e.g., Sadd 678: na padānam vippakaten' uttarena samāso, ${ }^{2}$ and Sadd 1157: vattamāne vippakatavacane mān'antā. ${ }^{3}$ Such words include present participles ending in suffixes māna and nta. Note that the term is missing in other two grammars.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ākhyāyante mukhyatayā pratipādyante yāni tāni ākhyātāni tyādīni /
    2 "Nouns are not compounded with following words denoting an incomplete action".

    3 "The suffixes māna and nta are added to a verbal root in the sense of the present tense to form words denoting an incomplete action".
# B. 

In P's system, sat is the name given to the present participial suffixes -šatr and -šănac. Cf. P 3.2.127: tau sat /
"(The technical term) sat denotes those two (krt affixes šatr and šănac)".

But P has no special name for the words derived by adding these suffixes. They are generally referred to as sadantas. Sat is itself a present participle, being derived from the root as 'to be' with the suffix -šatr and is taken as the type of all the present participles. The other systems find it unnecessary to have a single name for these two suffixes and generally use šatr-šănacau, šatrānau etc. for them.

## C.

The term vippakata / vippakatavacana is unparalleled in Sanskrit.

## 9. bhāvanapumsaka

## A.

Bhāvanapuṃsaka is the term used in the Aṭthakathās to denote an adverb. It means 'a word in neuter denoting bhāva, i.e. 'an action''. Agg uses bhāvanapuṃsaka at Sadd 590. In the discussion on this rule, Agg observes:
"Here bhāvanapuṃsaka is the usage found in the dispensation (sāsana) whereas kiriyāvisesana occurs in the science of grammar ". ${ }^{1}$

The term is, however, missing in Kacc and MV. In MVu, the word denoting an adverb is kiriyāvisesana. Cf. MVu 2.28: kriyāvisesane

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ettha ca bhāvanapuṃsakaṃ ti sāsane vohāro, kiriyāvisesanam ti saddasatthe /
kammani dutiyā ... kriyāvisesanam bhū dhātussa gammamānattā / and MVu 5.63: ghañantena kriyāvisesanena siddham /

# B. 

The literal meaning of the term kriyāvisesana is 'a determinant or modifier of a verbal activity'. In grammar, it is used of an adverb. In Sanskrit, the adverbs are generally used in the neuter gender and in the accusative case in the singular number. Cp. kriyāvisesanānām karmatvaṃ napuṃsakalingatā ca/

Kriyāvisesana in the sense of 'an adverb' probably occurred for the first time in Mbh I.367:
sakriyāvisesanaṃ ceti vaktavyam / susṭhu pacati, dusṭhu pacati / 1

The term also occurs in the Kāśikā on P 2.3.33 and CVṛ 2.1.87. The term is, however, missing in the Kt .

## C.

Following the Aṭthakathā tradition, Agg uses bhāvanapumsaka to denote an adverb whereas like the Sanskrit grammarians, Mogg uses kiriyāvisesana.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "One should say: also an adverb. E.g. He cooks well, he cooks badly".
# Terminology Denoting Syntactic Relations 

## 1. kāraka

## A.

The literal meaning of the term kāraka is 'a doer'. Cf. Sn 445. However, in the grammatical context, the term signifies a syntactic relation of an action and its participants. A kāraka is that, which is characterized by a relation to an action (Kahrs 1992: 28). Cf. Sadd 547 :
kiriyābhisambandhalukkhaṇaṃ kārakam /
Though the term kāraka does not occur in any of the Kacc's rules, the sixth kanda of the second chapter is called kārakakappa. Cf. Kacc 273-275 etc.

Mogg has used the term kāraka but he has not provided any formal definition of the term. ${ }^{1}$

Agg's kārakakappa opens up with the verse
ito paraṃ sasambandham vibhattippabhavaṃ chadh $\bar{a} /$
kārakam vibhajitvāna pavakkhāmi, sunātha me //2
Here kāraka is described as originating from the cases. Agg's statement "or: it distributes / divides the kārakas [which are] kamma etc. with regard to singular and plural; hence vibhatti"3

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhāvakārakesvughan ghākā / (MV 5.44)
    2 "In what follows, I shall explain the kāraka, which has its origin in case suffixes, along with the [general] relation [denoted by a genitive case ending], dividing it [= the kāraka] into six, [so] listen to me." (Kahrs 1992:15)
    3 kammādayo va kārake ekavacanabahuvacanavasena vibhajati ti vibhatti / (Padamālā 15,4)
(Kahrs 1992: 19) presents the grammatical cases as distributors of kärakas. ${ }^{1}$ If this were accepted then the whole purpose of introducing kärakas as met with in the Pāninian grammar would be distorted. In P's system, the abstract level of käraka is introduced to account for the correct distribution of cases.

Agg defines the term kāraka as: kiriyānimittam kārakam /
"A kāraka is the cause of an action." (Sadd $547=$ Kahrs 1992:28)
The same definition is also met with at KVP on Kt 2.4.1: kārakam ca kriyānimittam and KVP on Kt 2.4.8: kārakam hi kriyānimittam / The definition of kāraka as the cause of an action comes up also in the commentary of Helārāja on Vākya 3.7.24:
"That which is the cause of an action, which is mentioned through an action word, is a kāraka."2 (Kahrs 1992:30)
Also cp. the Kāśikā:
"And the word kāraka is a synonym of nimitta (cause); kāraka, hetu (cause) - [these terms] do not convey any different sense. The cause of what? Of an action (kriyā)". ${ }^{3}$ (Kahrs 1992: 29)
Agg further explains:
"That which, in as much as it is something which has sādhana 'realising' as its real nature, [and] is, primarily or secondarily, the cause of the occurrence of an action, that thing is known as a kāraka; for primarily or secondarily it brings about

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Note that at Sadd 198, vibhatti is defined as kammādivasena ekattādivasena ca vividhā bhājiyantī ti vibhattiyo "Vibhattis are so called as they are divided in many ways by way of meanings such as 'an object' (kumma) etc. and 'singularity' (ekatta) etc.".
    2 yat tu kriyāpadopättāyāh kriyāyā nimittam tat kārakam eva / (Hel 251, 2-3)
    3 kārakaśabdaś ca nimittaparyāyah / kārakam, hetur ity anarthāntaram / kasya hetuh? kriyāyāh / (Kāśikā on P 1.4.23)
an action, hence [it is called] kāraka". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:28)
Agg here amplifies his definition by adding the words, mukyavasena vā upacāravasena vā "primarily or secondarily". This is done in view of a problem that if the term kāraka is to be understood according to the analysis karotīti kārakam "It brings about, accomplishes, hence (it is called) a kāraka", only the agent would be a kāraka proper. This problem was already discussed by Kātyāyana in vārttikas 6 and 7 on P 1.4.23 and Ptj in his Mbh. Kātyāyana and Ptj have made a distinction between the main agent and the agency ascribed to the other kārakas (vārttikas 8 and 9 on P 1.4.23 and the Bhāsya on it).

In the same rule, Agg claims that the kārakas are sixfold. They are listed as kattukammakaranasumpadānāpādān'okāsā (Sadd 547). This is the enumeration also common to Sanskrit grammars. ${ }^{2}$ However, in the Padamālā, Agg has introduced two more types of classifications. According to one classification, it is threefold: kamma, kattar, and bhāva:
"Kamma, kattar, and bhāva: thus kārakas are threefold." ${ }^{3}$
According to another enumeration, it is sevenfold adding bhāva to the above mentioned six:
"Thus, in this context, the six sādhanas have been promulgated as bhāva, kattar, kamma, karana, apādāna, and adhikarana; they are sevenfold with that sādhana which is the sampadāna". ${ }^{4}$

1 yaṃ sādhanasabhāvattā mukhyavasena vā upacāravasena vā kiriyābhiniyphattiyā nimittam, taṃ vatthu kārakam nāma bhavati; mukhyopacāravasena hi kiriyaṃ karotīti kārakam / (Sadd 547)
2 kartā karma ca karanaṃ sampradānaṃ tathaiva ca / apādānādhikaraṇam ity āhuh kārakāni ṣaṭ //
3 kammaṃ kattā ca bhāvo ca icc evaṃ kārakā tidhā / (Sadd 20,33)
4 evam ettha bhāvakattukammakarañāpādānādhikaraṇavasena cha sādhunāni pakāsitāni, tāni sampadānasādhanena sattavidhāni bhavanti /
According to Agg, the threefold kārakas viz., kattar, kamma and bhāva are available in finite verb whereas the sevenfold kārakas are related to the primary derivatives:
"Thus it has been stated, following the conventions of nirutti, that the bhāvakāraka and the two kārakas (viz.) agent and object constitute a triad of kārakas, and the verb with (its) three kārakas illustrates this". ${ }^{1}$
"This being so, through primary formations there are (these) sevenfold sādhanas in fact on every occasion, these which are (hence) also called kārakas". ${ }^{2}$

Apart from kāraka, the Pali grammarians have also used the term sädhana to denote the syntactic relation:

Buddhaṃ ñānasamuddaṃ sabbaññuṃ lokahetu-
khinnamatim /
vanditvā pubbamahaṃ vakkhāmi susādhanaṃ
kitakappam //
(Opening verses of the kibbidhānakappa of the Kacc)
Also cf. the Mmd and the Kacc-Vn on the same. Note that the chapter of Bhartṛhari's Vākya, which deals with kārakas, is called sādhanasamuddeśa.

1 evaṃ niruttinayaṃ nissāya vuttam bhāvakārakañ ca dve ca kammakattukārakānī ti kārakattayam bhavati taddīpakañ cākhyātikapadaṃ tikārakam / (Sadd 10, 19-31) Also cp. Kacc-Vn on the opening verses of the Ākhyātakappa: yantikālaṃ tipurisaṃ kriyāvāci tikārakam / attilingaṃ dvivacanaṃ tadākhyātaṃ ti vuccati //
2 icc evaṃ kitakavasena sabbatthā pi sattavidhāni sādhanāni honti, yāni kārakānī ti pi vuccanti / (Sadd 68,30-69,2) Also cp. Kacc-Vn on the opening verses of the Kibbidhānakappa: evaṃ sādhanattayasahitam ākhyātakappạ̣ niṭ̣̣hāpetvā idānī sattasādhanasahitaṃ kitakappam ārabhanto ... 'buddhaṃ ñānasamuddam ... sādhanena yuttam' ti gāthācatukkamāha /
# B. 

The word kāraka occurs for the first time in Astt. In its technical sense, it is neither found in the Nir nor in the Prātisāāhyas.

P used kārake as an adhikāra rule (P 1.4.23) without defining it. According to Ptj, it is a meaningful term. In his discussion of the rule P 1.4.23: kārake, Ptj suggests that kāraka is sādhaka 'that which accomplishes, realises' and nirvartaka 'that which brings about':
"It should be stated that that which accomplishes, that which brings about, is something to which the technical name kāraka applies". ${ }^{1}$

The term kāraka is analysed by him as karotīti kārakam / (Mbh I:324)
Though Śarva has defined different kārakas, he has not used the term kāraka in his grammar.

Following P, C also uses the term kāraka without defining it. Cf.: ghañ kārake ca / (CV 1.3.7)

## 2. kattar

## A.

The literal meaning of the word kattar is 'doer, maker' (A I.103, II.67; Ja I.378). As a technical term of grammar, it denotes a grammatical agent. In this sense, it occurs at Vv-a 97.

K defines kattar as: yo karoti sa kuttā / (Kacc 283)
"One who acts is designated as kattar (an agent)."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sādhakam nirvartakam kārakasamjñam bhavatīti vaktavyam / (Mbh I:323)
Agg amplifies K's definition thus: yo kurute yo vā jāyati, so kattā / (Sadd 548)
"The one that acts or [for example] the one that is being born, that [käraka] is the kattar "agent"." (Kahrs 1992:31)

The inclusion of yo vā jāyati in the rule seems to be inspired by Bhartṛhari's discussion at Vākya 3.7.105. ${ }^{1}$ Bhartṛhari here discusses the problem that the agent of the act of being born is a contradiction in terms if what is born is considered not to exist prior to its coming into existence. This is discussed at length by Helārāja in his commentary on the same verse.

Further in the commentary, Agg says:
"The one that has presumed predominance and performs an action such as a going or a cooking or [for example] the one that is being born, that participant of an action is called the agent". ${ }^{2}$ (Kahrs 1992:31)

Here the phrase attappadhāno hutvā (presuming predominance) is specially added to avoid the application of other kāraka designations in the case of kattar. Cp. Kacc-Vn 283:
attappadhāno hutvā kriyaṃ karotī ti kattā / iminā suttena puriso gacchatītyādisu uttakattūsu pi aññakārakasaññānivattanatthaṃ kattusaññā kātabbā / kasmā viññāyatī ti? yo karoti sa kattā ti sāmaññavasena /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 utputteḥ prāg asadbhāvo buddhyavasthāhibandhanaḥ / aviśiṣ̣̣h sutā’nyena kartā bhavati janmanaḥ //
    "Before it is produced, there is no existence. On the basis of the special intention of the speaker, it becomes, without difference from any other existing thing, the agent of the act of being born".
    2 yo attappadhāno hutvā gamanapacanādikaṃ kiriyaṃ kurute yo vā jāyati, so kārako kattā nāma bhavati/
Agg's inclusion of attappadhāno hutvā seems to be inspired by the need to include P's definition of an agent: svatantraḥ kartā ( P 1.4.54). Here it should be noted that Mbh glosses the term svatantra by pradhāna. ${ }^{1}$ Kāśikā and Nyāsa have also followed Mbh in this regard. Haradatta and Helārāja's explanation of svatantrah comes even closer to the statement of Agg:
sva ātmā tantram pradhānam asya (KāśP 583, Hel 312,2 )

Also cp. Kaiyaṭa:
svaśabda ātmavācī / sva ātmā tantram pradhānaṃ yasya sa svatantra ucyate / (MbhP II:436)

Further in the discussion, Agg remarks:
"The kāraka which is the agent has as its defining characteristic the bringing about [of something]". ${ }^{2}$ (Kahrs 1992:32)

Besides this, Agg has one more rule defining a syntactic relation kattar. Sadd 549 says: asantaṃ santaṃ vā kappīyati, tañ ca /
"That which is non-existent is considered as if it were existent; that too [is assigned to the category of an agent]". (Kahrs 1992:39)

This rule is specially formulated to extend the kattar designation to unreal illusive objects, e.g., sasavisānaṃ tiṭthati (Horn of a hare exists), udumbarapuppham vikasati (an udumbara flower blossoms). Though such objects do not have any actual existence, they play the role of a grammatical agent on the level of verbal usage. This rule is absent in the Kacc. It seems to be based on an

[^0]
[^0]:    1 svatantro'sau brāhmaṇa ity ucyate svapradhāna iti gamyate "(for example, when) it is said 'that Brāhmaṇa is independent', (the meaning) 'having himself as the predominant one' is understood." (Mbh I:338)
    2 abhinipphädanalukkhaṇaṃ kattukārakam/
important verse of the Vākya expressing a fundamental view on kārakas in general:
sādhanavyavahāraś ca buddhyavasthānibandhanaḥ /
sann asan vā'rtharāpeṣu bhedo buddhyā prakalpyate //1
(Vākya 3.7.3)
Mogg uses the term kattar at MV 2.18: kattukaraṇesu tatiyā, 5.33: kattari ltuṇakā etc. without defining it.

# Types of kattar 

At Sadd 548, Agg puts forward a threefold classification of an agent into a pure agent, a causal agent and a kammakatt $\bar{a}$ :
"The one that performs an action all by himself is called the pure agent, as for example: 'the man walks the road' ... The one that instigates another to action is called the causal agent ... 'Yajñadatta makes Devadatta move'". ${ }^{2}$ (Kahrs 1992:32)

Kacc 284 defines the causal agent as: yo kāreti sa hetu
"The one who makes the other act is designated as hetu (cause) as well as kattar (an agent)".
Agg amplifies the same definition as: yo kāreti yo vā upatṭhāpayati, so hetu / (Sadd 550)
"The one that causes [someone else] to act or [for example] the one that generates, that [kāraka] is the hetu [causal agent]." (Kahrs 1992:41)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "Also the practice of [referring to] the means [of an action] is dependent on [the speaker's] frame of mind. Difference in the form of things, whether it is existent or non-existent, is conceived by the mind". (Kahrs 1992:39)
    2 yo sayam eva kiriyaṃ karoti, so suddhakattā nāma, taṃ yathā: puriso muggam gacchati ... yo aññam kummani yojeti, so hetukattā nāma, ... Yaññadatto Devudattam gamayati /
Also cp. Kacc-Vn 284:
aññabyāpāram pațicca gamanādikaṃ kriyaṃ hinoti pavattatī ti hetu/

Here, it should be noted that Mogg uses the word payojjakattar to denote the agent instigated by a causal agent. Cf. MVu 2.4.

A kammakattar is explained by Agg as:
"But even the one occurring as the object, with reference to the action of another, is accomplished easily by itself, as it were; it is called kammakattar ... 'the mat is made by itself'". ${ }^{1}$ (Sadd $548=$ Kahrs 1992:32)

Agg is the only Pali grammarian who speaks of this agent (kammakattar). Further in the text, Agg comments that the teachers are in favour of the fivefold classification of an agent including two more categories of abhihitakatt $\bar{a}$ (the agent specified by a finite verb) and anabhihitakatt $\bar{a}$ (the agent not specified by a finite verb). Abhihita and anabhihita kattar are only two different modes of expression and they in any way do not form two distinct categories of agent.

# B. 

The Sanskrit term kartr is an older term going back to the RV. In its technical sense, it appears to occur first in the Aṣt. P 1.4.54: svantantraḥ kartā defines kartr as
"(The technical term) kartr (agent) denotes (that kāraka) which is independent (in relation to others)".

Commenting on this, the Kāsikā says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yo pana parassa kiriyaṃ pațicca kammabhūto pi sukarattā sayam eva sijjhanto viya hoti, so kammakattā nāma ... sayam eva kaṭo kariyati /
"Independent means 'who [by the speaker] is spoken of as predominant'". ${ }^{1}$

Śarva's rule defining kartr is: yah karoti sa kartā / (Kt 2.4.14)
"One who acts is designated as kartr (an agent)."
This is exactly identical with Kacc 283.
The Sanskrit grammatical tradition also speaks of two more types of agents: a causal agent and a karmakartr. P defines the causal agent as: tatprayojako hetuśs ca / (P 1.4.55)
"(The technical term) hetu and (the technical term kartr) denote the instigator of that agent."
Śarva's rule in this regard is kārayati yah sa hetuś ca / (Kt 2.4.15)
"The one who makes the other act is designated as hetu (cause) as well as kartr (an agent)."

Here too the rules of the Kacc and the Kt are identical. Also cp. the DV and the Kacc-Vu:
tam eva kartāraṃ yah kārayati sa hetusamjño
bhavati, cakārāt kartrsaṃjñaś ca / (DV 2.4.15)
yo kattāraṃ kāreti so hetusañño hoti kattā ca /
(Kacc-Vu 284)
P uses the term karmakartr at P 3.1.62: acah karmakartari and the karmakartr construction is taught by him in the rule 3.1.87: karmavat karmaṇa tulyakriyah, which states that an agent that acts like an object is treated as an object. It is interesting to note that the examples provided by Agg for the kammakattar construction occur already in Mbh on P 3.1.87.

# 3. kamma 

## A.

The literal meaning of the word kamma is 'doing, deed'. As a technical term of grammar, it denotes a grammatical object. Here it should be noted that in the Aṭthakathās, the term upayoga is used for kamma. The literal meaning of the word upayoga is 'connection, combination; employment, application'. In its technical sense of a grammatical object, upayoga is used at Ja V. 214.

K defines kamma as: yaṃ karoti taṃ kammam / (Kacc 282)
"What one does that (käraka) is the kamma."
This is a recast of yat kriyate tat karma / (Kt 2.4.13) The Kacc-Vu explains the rule thus:
"What one does or what one sees, or what one hears that (käraka) is the kamma (object)". ${ }^{1}$

Sadd 551 combines Kacc 282 and the Vutti thereupon: yaṃ kurute yaṃ vā passati, taṃ kammam /
"What one does or [for example] what one sees, that [käraka] is the kamma 'object'." (Kahrs 1992:43)
Explaining it further, Agg says:
"It is done (karīyate), it is attained through the action, thus [it is called] an object (kamma). The käraka, which is the object, has as its defining characteristic the reaching [something] through an action". ${ }^{2}$

This again is an attempt to incorporate P's definition of karman: kartur īpsitatamaṃ karma / (P 1.4.49)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yaṃ vā karoti, yaṃ vā passati, yaṃ vā suṇāti taṃ kārakaṃ kammasaññaṃ hoti /
    2 karīyate taṃ kiriyāya pāpunīyate ti kammam / kiriyāpattilakkhaṇaṃ kammakārakam /
"(The technical term) karman denotes what the agent most desires to reach (through his action)."

Kāśikā explains the rule as:
"That kāraka, which is most desired to be connected with the action of an agent, is called karman". ${ }^{1}$

Mogg uses the term kamma at kamme dutiyā (MV 2.2), tassa bhāvakammesu ttatāttatanyaneyyaniyaniya (MV 4.59), kyo bhāvakammesvaparokkhesu mānantatyādisu (MV 5.17) etc. without defining it. However, at MVu 2.2, it is defined as: karīyati kattukriyāyābhisambandhīyatīti kammam /
"Kamma is that which is done / that which is connected with the action of an agent".

# Types of kamma 

Agg provides the threefold and the sevenfold classification of kamma. According to the first classification, the kamma kāraka is classified into three:

1. nibbattanīya (the object which is to be produced)
2. vikaranīya (the object which is to be modified)
3. pāpanīya (the object which is to be attained)

According to another classification, the kamma kāraka is of seven types:
a. icchitakamma (the wanted object)
b. anicchitakamma (the object which is unwanted)
c. nevicchitanānicchitakamma (the object which is neither wanted nor unwanted)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 kartuh kriyayā yad āptum īṣtatamaṃ tat kārakaṃ karmasaṃjñam bhavati /
    2 kriyayā pūrvakālabhāvinyā yad aprāptam prāpyate tat sādhanaṃ karma /
    3 kartuh kriyayā yat kriyate yad vyāpyate tat karma /
d. akathitakamma (the object which is not expressed) and kathitakamma (the object which is already expressed)
e. kattukamma (the agent-object)
f. abhihitakamma (the object which has been specified by verbal affixes)
g. anabhihitakamma (the object which is not so specified) ${ }^{1}$

According to E. Kahrs (1992:46), the source of this classification is Bhartṛhari's Vākya 3.7.45-46:
nirvartyaṃ ca vikāryaṃ ca prāpyaṃ ceti tridhā matam /
tatrepsitatamaṃ karma caturdhā'nyat tu kalpitam // audāsīnyena yat prāpyaṃ yac ca kartur anīpsitam / samjñāntarair anākhyātam yad yac cāpy anyapūrvakam // ${ }^{2}$

1 E. Kahrs (1992:52) has suggested a different counting where icchita, anicchita and nevicchitanānicchitakamma forms the forth category in addition to nibbattanīya, vikaraṇīya and pāpanīya. Kathita and akathita kamma forms the fifth category, kattukamma the sixth and abhihita and anabhihita kamma the seventh. For details see Kahrs (1992:42 ff). We, however, object this counting as it is not in accordance with the spirit and letter of the text which runs as follows: tam tividham nibbattanīyādivasena, sattavidham api kecit icchanti icchitādivasena "It is of three kinds: in as much as it is to be produced etc.; others teach that it is also sevenfold in as much as it is wanted etc.". This clearly shows that the sevenfold classification begins with icchitakamma and not with nibbattanīya. Putting abhihita and anabhihita kamma into one category also goes against Agg's usual style in which they form two different categories. Cp. for instance the classification of kattar.

2 "Among them [= the kārakas] the object, being what is most desired, is considered to be of three kinds, as it is to be produced, modified or attained. Furthermore, it has been imagined as fourfold: that which is to be attained through indifference and that which is not desired by the agent, that which has not been designated by another technical name [= another kāraka category] and that which previously had another [kāraka designation]." (Kahrs 1992:46)
According to Agg, ratham karoti, sukham janayati etc. are examples of nibbattanīya kamma. About vikaranīya kamma he says that it is of two types:
a. pariccattakārana (the one that has left its material cause behind)
b. apariccattakārana (the one that has not left its material cause behind)

Among these, the one which has come about as a result of destruction of the cause as in the case of 'he makes wood (into) charcoal' etc. is called 'that which has left (its) cause behind' (pariccattakārana). The one where a different designation is noticed as a result of the birth of a different property (pertaining to the object) only when that which existed as a cause is met with in the objects is called 'the one that has not left (its) cause behind' (apariccattakārana) as in the case of 'he makes gold (into) a bracelet or a ring'. The object to be attained (pāpanīya) is that in which no difference is made by the action in (sentences) other than the mere attainment as in case of 'he enters the abode'. Note that this explanation of nibbattanīya, vikaranīya and pāpanīya kamma is based on Vākya 3.7.49-51:
yad asaj jāyate sad vā janmanā yat prakāśyate /
tan nirvartyam vikāryam ca karma dvedh $\bar{a}$
vyavasthitam //
prakrtyucchedasambhūtaṃ kiṃ cit
kāsthā̄dibhasmavat /
kiṃ cid guṇāntarotpattyā suvarṇādivikāravat //
kriyākrta viśeṣānạ̣̄ siddhir yatra na gamyate /
darśanād anumānād vā tat prāpyam iti kathyate //1

1 "That [previously] non-existing [object] which is being born or that existing [object] which becomes manifest through its birth, that is the nirvartya, and the vikārya is established as of two kinds: One [kind of vikāryakarman] is that which results from destruction of the material cause, as ashes from wood etc., [and another is] the one [that results] from the arising of other properties, as the modification of gold etc. [into such things as jewellery]. That [object] upon
E. Kahrs points out that Agg here has missed the primary explanation of nirvartya and vikārya karman as it occurs in the Vākya 3.7.47-48. ${ }^{1}$ This raises the doubt that Bhartṛhari's Vākya might not be the direct source of Agg's explanation. The likely source of this explanation is the DT, for its explanation of nirvartya and vikārya is also based on the Vākya 3.7.49-50 and it does not consider Vākya 3.7.47-48.

# B. 

Karman in its original sense of 'act, action' goes back to the RV. It is used in the Nir as also in some rules of P in its earlier sense. From meaning 'an action', karman came to mean 'the object towards which the action is directed' and in this sense, it appears first in Aṣṭ: kartur īpsitatamaṃ karma / (P 1.4.49) '
"(The technical term) karman denotes what the agent most desires to reach (through his action)."

Karman is also found in the Kt. There it is defined as: yat kriyate tat karma / (Kt 2.4.13)
"What is done (by one) is karman."
The word $\bar{a} p y a$ in J's definition (kartrāpyaṃ karma 1.2.145) appears to have caught the fancy of C who uses $\bar{a} p y a$ or vyāpya for karman. For P's bhāvakarmaṇoh (P 1.3.13), C generally uses
which the establishment of differences that has come about through the action is understood neither by observation nor by inference, that [object] is called prāpya 'to be attained'. (Kahrs 1992:49, 50)
1 satī vā'vidyamānā vā prakṛtih parināminī / yasya nāšrīyate tasya nirvartyativum pracakṣate // prakrtes tu vivakṣāyāṃ vikāryaṃ kaiś cid anyathā / nirvartyaṃ ca vikāryaṃ ca karma śāstre pradarsītam //
"The property of being produced is said to belong to that whose material cause which undergoes transformation - whether it is existent or not - is not taken into consideration [for the statement]. But when the speaker intends [to express] the material cause, then it [is called] vikārya; karman as nirvartya and vikārya has been defined differently in the Śāstra".
bhāvāpyayoh (CV V1.1.78, CV 5.3.73). In the later portion of the CV, however, karman makes its appearance only once in the rule abhāvakarmanor ano ye (CV 5.3.168). C sometimes uses āpya and sometimes vyāpya: veh śabdāpyāt (CV 1.4.80), avyāpyāt (CV 1.4.81), kartr̥sthamūrtāpyāt (CV 1.4.83).

# Types of karman 

In the Pāninian tradition, the classification of karman into nirvartya, vikārya and prāpya goes back to the Vārttikakara:
karmani nirvartyamānavikriyamāne ced vedādhyayanādīnām upasaṃkhyānam / (Vt. 1 on P 3.2.1: karmany an /)

The other categories of īpsita, anīpsita, udāsina, and akathita are drawn from P's rules 1.4.49-51. The category of akathitakarma is designated as saṃjñāntarair anākhyātam (Vākya 3.7.46) by Bhartṛhari:
"That which has not been designated by another technical term (= another kāraka category)". (Kahrs 1992: 46)

The kattukamma category given by Agg is, however, missing in the Pāninian tradition. Similarly, the anyapūrvaka "that which previously had another (kāraka designation)" category is absent in Sadd.

## 4. karana

## A.

The literal meaning of the word karana is 'doing, making, causing, producing'. ${ }^{1}$ As a technical term of grammar denoting the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 S IV.331; V.97; It 83; A V.23; A II. 22.
instrumental case, it occurs at Pv-a 33, 35; Vv-a 25, 53, 304; Ja III.98, V.444; As 48.

K defines karana as: yena vā karīyate tam karanam /
"Or that by means of which one acts that (käraka) is called karana 'instrument'." (Kacc 281)

Elaborating upon this, the Vutti says:
"That by means of which one acts or that by means of which one sees, or that by means of which one hears, that is (the kāraka) karana 'instrument'". ${ }^{1}$

This definition of Kacc is already met with in Kt 2.4.12. (See below)
Sadd 552 is a combination of Kacc 281 and the Vutti thereupon. Sadd reads: yena kurute yena vā passati, tam pi karanam /
"That by means of which one acts or [for example] that by means of which one sees, that too is [the kāraka] karana 'instrument'." (Kahrs 1992:58)

Agg explains it further as:
"Something is done with it, [or] one accomplishes an action with it, [that is,] with a thing being an implement for the agent, thus [it is called] instrument (karana)."2 (Kahrs 1992:59)

After explaining K's definition, Agg tries to link it with P's definition: sādhakatamaṃ karanam / (P 1.4.42)
"The most effective means [is called] the instrument."

According to Agg,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yena vā kayirati, yena vā passati, yena vā sunāti tam kārakum. karanasaññam hoti /

    2 kariyati kiriyam janeti anena kuttuno upakaranabhūtena vatthunā ti karanam /
"And with regard to this, although the property of being a means of [accomplishing] an action pertains to all kārakas, [this] statement, having specified 'that by means of which' etc., is intended for the understanding of only the most effective means among the means which work as implements for the agent. The kāraka which is the instrument is characterized as the implement of the action". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:59)

This is the meaning of the superlative suffix -tamap in P's rule. Commenting on P 1.4.42, the Kāśikā says:
"Karana is that which is the most instrumental factor and which is utmost helpful in accomplishing an action". ${ }^{2}$

Note that this issue is first raised in Mbh on P 1.4.42.
Mogg uses karana at MV 2.18: kattukaranesu tatiyā, MVu 5.27: bahulādhikārā karañādisu pi bhavanti without defining it.

# Types of karana 

Agg provides a twofold classification of karana into ajjhattika and bāhira. This classification has its parallel in DT and KVP on Kt 2.4.12. Cp.:
tam duvidham ajjhattikabāhiravasena / (Sadd 552)
tac ca karanaṃ dvividham bāhyam ābhyantaraṃ ca /
(DT, KVP 2.4.12)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ettha ca, sati pi subbakārakānaṃ kiriyāsādhakatte, 'yena kurute' ti ādi visesetvā vacanaṃ kattūpakaraṇabhütesu sādhanesu sādhakatamass' eva gahanattham / kiriyāsumbhāralakkhaṇaṃ karaṇakārakam /

    2 kriyāsiddhau yat prakrstopakārakam vivakṣitaṃ tat sādhakatamaṃ kārakaṃ karanasamjñam bhavati/
The terms ajjhattika and bāhira are familiar from the Buddhist literature, particularly, in the context of skandha-, āyatana-, and dhātu- analysis.

# B. 

Karana in the sense of 'an act, a deed' is found in RV. As a technical term denoting an instrumental case, it is used in every system of grammar except Mu , which uses $d h a$.

As said above, P defines karana as sādhakatamaṃ karanam / (P 1.4.42)

Śarva defines karana as: yena kriyate tat karanam / (Kt 2.4.12)
"That by means of which one acts that (käraka) is called karana 'instrument'."

C uses the term karana at karaṇe (CV 2.1.63) without defining it.

## 5. sampadāna

## A.

Sampadāna has no canonical status. In the Aṭthakathās, it is only used as a technical term of grammar denoting the dative relation. ${ }^{1}$ Agg explains the term sampadāna as:
"In the proper (samm $\bar{a}=$ sam) way (pakāreṇa $=p a$ ) one gives to that one, thus [it is called] sampadāna, [that is,] the one who receives". ${ }^{2}$ (Kahrs 1992:61)

Mogg also paraphrases the term as yassa sammā padīyate ... (MVu 2.26) Also cp. Kacc-Vṇ 278: sammā dīyate assā ti sampadānam and Rüp 581: sammā pakāreṇa dadāti assā ti sampadānam / A similar

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Ja V. 214 (upyogatthe), 237 (karaṇatthe).
    2- summā pakāreṇa assa dadātī ti sampadānam paṭiggāhako / (Sadd 553)
semantic analysis of the term sampradāna occurs at the Nyāsa on the Kāśikāvṛtti: samyak prakarṣena dīyate / (KāśN I:546)
"Properly, excellently it is given." (Kahrs 1992:62)
K defines sampadāna as: yassa dätukāmo rocate dhārayate vā taṃ sampadānam / (Kacc 278)
"The one to whom (an agent) has a desire to give, or to whom (something) is pleasing, or to whom one owes that (käraka is called) sampadāna."

This again is a recast of yasmai ditsā rocate dhārayate vā tat sampradānam / (Kt 2.4.10) Note that K has rendered dits $\bar{a}$ as dätukāmo.

Agg alters K's definition by replacing rocate by ruccati and dropping dhārayate from the main rule. Sadd 553 reads: yassa dātukāmo yassa vā ruccati, taṃ sampadānam /
"[That kāraka] to whom [the agent] has a desire to give, or [for example] [that kāraka] to whom [something] is pleasing, [is called] sampadāna 'recipient'." (Kahrs 1992:61)

He, however, amplifies this definition by bringing in two options:
yassa vā dātukāmo yassa vā ruccati yassa vā
khamati yassa vā dhārayate, taṃ kārakaṃ
sampadānasaññaṃ hoti /
According to Agg,
"The [kāraka] which is the sampadāna is characterized by receiving". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:62)

Mogg uses the term sampadāna at MV 2.26: catutthī sampadāne without defining it.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 pañiggahaṇalakkhaṇuṃ sampadānakārakum/
# Types of sampadāna 

Agg classifies sampadāna into three: anirākarana (nonrejecting), ajjhesanā (requesting) and anumati (approval). This threefold division of the sampadāna goes back to Vākya 3.7.129:
"That element in [the act of] forsaking which is the goal to be attained by the object [of the action of giving, i.e. the gift,] attains the property of being the sampradāna [either] from not refusing (anirākaran̄̄t) the agent [of giving], or from urging (preran $\bar{a} t$ ) [the giver] or from giving consent (anumateh)". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:63)

Apart from the replacement of the term prerana $\bar{a}$ with the synonymous term ajjhesan $\bar{a}$, the classification is the same. A similar classification also occurs at DT and KVP on Kt 2.4.10:
"Sampradāna is one who allows, one who does not refuse, one who prompts, one who is the cause of giving away, that which is connected with the object of the act of giving". ${ }^{2}$

## B.

The word sampradāna as a technical term occurs for the first time in the Ast. In the VP, it is used in the sense of 'handing down by tradition' and in the Kauṣitakī Upaniṣad, it means 'a gift'. In the next stage, it meant 'the person to whom the gift is made' and is the name of the dative case in all the systems of grammar except Mu where it is replaced by bha.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 anirākaran̄āt kartus tyāgāngaṃ karmaṇepsītam / preran̄ānumatibhyāṃ ca labhate sampradānatām //
    2 anumantranirākartr prerakaṃ tyāgakāraṇam / vyāpyenāptaṃ dadātes tu sampradānam prakīrtitam //
P defines sampradāna as: karmaṇā yam abhipraiti sa sampradānam / (P 1.4.32)
"(The technical term) sampradāna (käraka) denotes one whom the agent intends as a goal or recipient through the object of the action (of giving)."
Bhāsyakāra here suggests the addition of the word kriyā: kriyāgrahanam api kartavyam / (Mbh I.330)

Śarva defines sampradāna as: yasmai ditsā rocate dhārayate $v \bar{a}$ tat sampradānam / (Kt 2.4.10)
"The one to whom (an agent) has a desire to give, or to whom (something) is pleasing, or to whom one owes that (käraka is called) sampradāna."

C uses sampradāna at CV 2.1.73: sampradāne caturthī without defining it.

# 6. apādāna 

## A.

Apādāna is derived from apa $+\bar{a}+d \bar{a}$ 'to take off or away'. This term has no canonical status. As a technical term of grammar denoting the ablative relation, it probably occurred for the first time in the Kacc. As mentioned before, in the Atṭhakathās, the term used to denote the ablative relation is nissakka. ${ }^{1}$ It literally means 'going out'.

K defines apādāna as: yasmād apeti bhayam ādatte vā tad apādānam / (Kacc 273)
"That from which something moves away or there is a fear, or someone takes, that (käraka) is an apādāna."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Ja V.498; Vv-a 152, 154, 180, 311; Pv-a 147, 221.
This is exactly identical with Kt 2.4.8. The similarity with KaccVu and DV is also noticeable. Cp.:
yasmā vā apeti, yasmā vā bhayaṃ jāyate, yasmā vā ādatte, taṃ kārakam apādānasaññaṃ hoti / (KaccVu 272)
yasmād apaiti, yasmād bhayam bhavati, yasmād ādatte vā, tat kārakam apādānasaṃjñam bhavati / (DV 2.4.8)

Agg alters K's definition as: yato apeti yato vā āgacchati, tad apādānam / (Sadd 555)
"That from which something moves away, or [for example] that from which something comes, that [kāraka] is the apādāna." (Kahrs 1992:127)

According to Agg, apādāna is a meaningful conventional term. He analyses apādāna as:
"'Moving away (apecca) from it something takes (ādadāti)', thus [it is called] apādāna. That is to say, moving away from it, [that is,] from some thing, physically or mentally, one attains something else". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:127)

Cp. Rūp 581: apecca etasmā ādadātī ti apādānam /
Following C, Mogg uses avadhi for apādāna at MV 2.28: pañcamyavadhism $\bar{a}$ / Note that under MV 5.48: ano, Mogg derives the term apādāna as one of the kārakas.

# Types of apādāna 

Agg provides various classifications of the apādāna kāraka:
"Now, this apādāna is of two kinds, according to whether the moving away is preceded by physical

[^0]
[^0]:    1 apecca ito ādadātī ti apādānam, ito vatthuto kāyavasena cittavasena vā apagantvā aññam ganhātī ti attho / (Sadd 555)
contact or whether it is preceded by mental contact; likewise according to whether the starting point is moving or whether the starting point is not moving. Or rather it is of three kinds, according to whether the starting point is moving, whether the starting point is not moving, or whether the starting point is not only moving or the starting point is not not moving; likewise according to where [the movement away] has been directly stated, where it is comprised, or where it has to be inferred". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:127)

The traces of the first two classifications can be found at DT 2.4.8:
"Separation does not take place only in case of a physical contact. What then? It takes place even in the case of a mental contact. And there upon, the cessation of contact is caused by separation of a mobile object from a stationary object so also of a static object from a mobile object. This nature of kāraka (apādāna) has separation common to both". ${ }^{2}$

The threefold classification of apādāna into niddiṭthavisaya, upättavisaya and anumeyyavisaya goes back to Vākya 3.7.136:
"The apādāna is said to be of three kinds: sometimes [it is the one] where the moving away is directly expressed, likewise where the moving away

1 tam pana apādānaṃ duvidhaṃ kāyasamyogapubbakacittasaṃyogapubbakāpagamavasena, tathā calāvadhiniccalāvadhivasena; atha vā pana tividham calāvadhiniccalāvadhinevacalāvadhinaniccalāvadhivasena, tathā niddhiṭthavisayaupättavisaya-anumeyyavisayavasena / (Sadd 555)
2 na hi kāyaprāptāv evāpāyah, kiṃ tarhi cittaprāptāv api, tataś ca samyoganivṛttir yathaiva hi calasyācalato viślesah, evam acalasyāpi calatah, so'yam ubhayoḥ samānaviśleṣakārakabhāvah/
is included, and also where the action [of moving away] is implied". ${ }^{1}$ (Kahrs 1992:128-129)

# B. 

The term apādāna appears to have been coined by grammarians for the purpose of their science and is used rarely, if at all, in literature. It is found for the first time in the Ast. It occurs in all the other systems of grammar except the Mu, which uses $j a$.

P defines apādāna as: dhruvam apāye'pādānam / (P 1.4.24)
"(The technical term) apādāna denotes (that kāraka) which functions as a stable point with respect to a movement away from itself, i.e., a point of departure."

Śarva defines apādāna as: yato'paiti bhayam ādatte vā tad apādānam / (Kt 2.4.8)
"That from which something moves away or there is a fear, or someone receives, that (kāraka) is an apādāna."

C uses avadhi for apādāna at CV 2.1.81: avadheh pañcamī/

## 7. okāsa

## A.

The literal meaning of the term okāsa is 'open space' (D I.34, Vism 184). As a technical term of grammar denoting the locative relation, it probably occurred for the first time in the Kacc. Note that in the Atṭhakathās, the term bhumma is used for the locative

[^0]
[^0]:    1 nirdistavissayam kim cid upāttavissayam tathā / apekṣitakriyam ceti tridhā'pādānam ucyate //
relation. ${ }^{1}$ Bhumma (Vedic bhūmya) is a secondary derivative from bhümi meaning 'belonging to the earth, earthly' and thus nearer to the sense conveyed by the English term locative.

K and Agg define okāsa as: yo'dhāro tamokāsam
"That which is the support [in time and space], that [kāraka] is the okāsa." (Kacc 280, Sadd 572 = Kahrs 1992:191)

This definition is modelled on Kt 2.4.11, the major difference being that K and, following him, Agg have used the term okāsa instead of the older term adhikarana. Explaining the definition further, Agg says:
"That which is the support (ädhāra), in the sense of that which is a supporter (ädhäraka) of actions such as sitting down or cooking which are inherent in the agent or the object, that kāraka is something to which the technical name okāsa applies". ${ }^{2}$ (Kahrs 1992:191)

This explanation has its bearing on the discussion in Vākya 3.7.148 regarding how adhikarana can be called a kāraka. The relevant verse in the Vākya is as follows:
kartṛkarmavyavahitām asākṣād dhārayat kriyām /
upakurvat kriyāsiddhau śāstre'dhikaraṇaṃ smṛtam //3
Note that the same issue is discussed at DT 2.4.11. According to Agg, $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r a$ is called okāsa because it actually is an occasion (where something happens) in the sense of support of these actions.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Pj I 106, 111, 224; Pj II 140, 210, 321, 433; Pv-a 33.
    2 yo kattukammasamaretānaṃ nisajjayacanädikiriyānam ādhārakatṭhena ādhāro, taṃ kārakam okāsasaññam hoti /
    3 "That which [both] indirectly supports the action separated [from it] by the agent or the object, [and] assists in accomplishing the action is called adhikarana in the science of grammar." (Kahrs 1992:195)
Following C, Mogg uses ādhāra instead of okāsa: sattamyādhāre (MV 2.34), and gamanatthākammakādhāre ca (MV 5.59). MVu 2.34 paraphrases the term $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r e$ as:
kriyādhārabhūtakattukammānaṃ dhāranena yo kriyāyādhāro tasmin /

Besides this, adhikarana is also found at MVu 2.2:
adhisithāsānam payogedhikaraṇe kammavacani-
cchā, ... akkhesu dibbatīti - kammakaranādhikaranavacanicch $\bar{a} /$

Agg also uses the term adhikarana at Sadd 1134: kuttukaranādhikaranesu ca / Note that at Kacc 550: kattukaranappadesesu ca, an additional term padesa is also used for okāsa.

# Types of okāsa 

Kacc-Vu 280, Sadd 572 and MVu 1.14 provide a fourfold classification of $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r a$ into byāpika (pervading), opasilesika (caused by a close contact), vesayika (belonging to a particular domain) and sāmīpika (caused by nearness). Tilesu telam is an example of the byāpika $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r a$, āsane upavittho sangho is of opasilesika ādhāra, bhūmisu manussā caranti of vesayika ādhāra and vane hatthino caranti of sāmīpika ādhāra. Cf. a verse quoted by Ananda Kausalyayana in his edition of the MV (1965: 5):
vyāpiko tiladadhyādi kaṭo opasilesiko/
sāmīpiko tu gangādi, ākāso visayo mato //
Sanskrit sources generally give the threefold classification of adhikarana leaving out sāmīpya. Ptj says:
"The adhikarana is indeed of three kinds, vyāpaka, aupaślesika, [and] vaisayika."1 (Mbh on P 6.1.72)

The same classification also occurs at the Padamanjarī, the Nyāsa, the Si. Kau. on P 2.3.36 and its commentaries, the Bālamanoramā

[^0]
[^0]:    1 adhikaranaṃ nāma triprakāraṃ vyāpakam aupaśleșikaṃ vaiṣayikum iti /
and the Tattvabodhinī. The Prakriyākaumudī of Rāmacandra gives this fourfold classification (PK 80):
aupaślesikah sāmīpiko viṣayo vyāpta ity ādhāraśs
caturdhā /
The Rūpāvatāra (162,12-13) of the pre-Aggavamsa Sinhalese Buddhist Dharmakirti also proposes a similar fourfold classification. The only difference being that instead of sāmīpya, Dharmakīti uses the term pratyāsatti:
"This $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r a$ 'support' is of four kinds, by being divided into aupaslesika, vaisayika, vyāpaka, and pratyāsatti". ${ }^{1}$

He adds (162,17-18): pratyāsattih sāmīpyam - gangāyām ghoṣah /
"Pratyāsatti, that is to say, sāmīpya 'nearness', [as in] 'a cow-shed on the Gang $\bar{a}$ '".

However, the most likely source of Agg's classification seems to be DT. Commenting on Kt 2.4.11, DT says:
sa ādhāraś caturvidhah - aupaślesikah, abhivyāpakah, vaisayikah, sāmīpikaś ceti /

# B. 

The term okāsa is unparalled in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit grammarians generally use the term adhikarana to denote the locative relation. Adhikarana is derived from adhi $+k r$ meaning literally 'the act of placing at the head', then 'receptacle, thing, sense'. In its technical sense, it occurs for the first time in the Aṣt.

P defines adhikarana as: $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r o$ 'dhikaranam / (P 1.4.45)
"(The technical term) adhikarana denotes the locus or substratum."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sa ādhārah aupaślesikavaiṣayikavyāpakapratyāsattibhedatvāt caturvidhah/
Śarva defines adhikarana as: ya ādhāras tad adhikaranam /
"That which is the support (in time and space), that (käraka) is the adhikarana." (Kt 2.4.11)

C uses $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r a$ in the place of adhikarana at CV 2.1.88: saptamy $\bar{a} d h \bar{a} r e$ without defining it.

# 8. sāmi / sambandha 

## A.

After defining different kārakas, K and Agg go on defining the term sämi, which is a generic term for all the syntactic relations expressed by the genitive case.

The literal meaning of the word sämi is 'owner, ruler, lord, master'. ${ }^{1}$ However, in the grammatical context, it signifies an owner-owned relationship.

K defines sämi as: yassa vā pariggaho taṃ sämi / (Kacc 285)
"Or, the one who has possession is a possessor."
The use of $s \bar{a} m i$ to denote the genitive has a counterpart in the discussion in Mbh on P 2.3.50, where the expression svämitva is used of the genitive relation räjñah puruşah. Sarva uses the term svämy $\bar{a} d i$ at Kt 2.4.19 to denote the genitive relation.

Agg amplifies K's definition as: yassa sam yassa vā pati, taṃ sämi/ (Sadd 575)
"The one who possesses wealth or that which has a master is called a possessor."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Vin I.303, 307; Sn 83; Mhv 37.
Thus, the term sāmi here stands for the owner-owned relationship including two relata, possessor and possession. In the commentary Agg says:
"The term sāmi denotes that which has wealth, or that which has a master, that which has an owner, that which forms a group, or that which has a part. Here too, the particle $v \bar{a}$ has a sense of optionality. Therefore, even other meanings are to be included in it". ${ }^{1}$

Thus, the term sāmi here represents various nominal relations expressed by the genitive.

According to the orthodox school, sāmi is not a kāraka relation, as it is not related to an action:
kiriyābhisambandhābhāvā n'esā kārakatā sambhavati/

However, according to Agg (Sadd 575), in cases like pitussa sarati, pitussa icchati etc. sāmi can be treated as a kāraka relation as in these cases a genitive is related to an action.

At Sadd 614: sambandhadvayādhāre, Agg uses the term sambandha in the same sense as that of sāmi. According to this rule,
"The sixth case is employed in sense of a twofold substrata of a nominal relation".

He defines sambandha at Sadd 613 thus:
visesanavisesitabbānaṃ vā sambandhānaṃ sambandho /
"Or the relation between a qualifier and a qualified is called a nominal relation (sambandha)."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 yassa atthajātassa dhanaṃ yassa vā pati yassa vā sāmi, yassa vā samāho yassa vā avayavo, tam atthajātaṃ sāmisaññaṃ hoti, idhā pi vāsaddo vikappanattho, tena aññe pi atthā yojetabbā/
This explanation can also be traced back to Vākya via DT 2.4.19:
"Since the words convey general meaning they are not able to convey specific meaning in the absence of a context. Further, the nominative is added to the qualified to convey the sense of the mere stem as it is the closest one, hence the genitive case is added to a qualifier, because the genitive alone can express the relation between the two. Thus it is said:
'The relation between a qualified and a qualifier is intended to be very close and mutual. Although the relation rests on both (a qualifier and a qualified), the genitive is added only after an adjective'". ${ }^{1}$

Following C, Mogg uses the term sambandha instead of sāmi. MV 2.41 reads: chattthī sambandhe /
"The sixth case is employed after a noun in the sense of a nominal relation".

This is identical with CV 2.1.95: saṣthī sambandhe / Commenting on MV 2.41, the MVu says:
"The sixth case is employed in the sense of a nominal relation (sambandha) which is born out of an action and its participants and which is the cause of a state: 'this belongs to it'". ${ }^{2}$

Thus, a nominal relation is a result of an action and its participants. Note that the same idea is also conveyed by Agg. Cp. Sadd 610:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 sāmānyavācakā hi śabdāh prakaranam antareṇa viśeṣe vartitum notsahante iti / paratas tu bhedyād antarañgatvāl ling̃ārthamātre prathamā astīti bhedakāt saṣthī bhavati / tayaivobhayagatasambandhasyoktatvāt / taduktum ca - bhedyabhedakayoh ślistah sambandho'nyo'nyam isyate / dviṣtho yady api sambandhah saṣthyutpattis tu bhedakāt // (Vākya 3.7.156)

    2 kriyākārakasañjāto assedambhāvahetuko sambandho nāma, tasmiṃ chattthī vibhattī hoti /
"Or, the sixth case endings are employed in the sense, which results out of an action and its participants and which is a cause of the state: 'that belongs to it'". ${ }^{1}$

These portions of MV and Sadd have their basis in the Vākya 3.7.157² and DT 2.4.19's explanation of the word sambandha: asyedam = bhāvarūpasvasvāmyādilakṣaṇah sambandha iti /

# B. 

In P's Aṣt, the term denoting a genitive relation is śeṣa: ṣaṣthī śese / (P 4.2.92)
"The sixth sup triplet is introduced (after a nominal stem) to denote residual relationships."

Commenting on the word śeṣa, the Kāśikā says:
"Śesa is the relation such as that between the owned and the owner etc. which is other than the meaning of the stem and different from the object etc.". ${ }^{3}$

Śarva uses svāmyādi to denote the genitive relations:
śeṣāh karmakaraṇasampradānāpādānasvāmyādyadhikaraṇeṣu / (Kt 2.4.19)
"The remaining (case endings from the second upto the seventh) are employed in the sense of karma, karana, sampradāna, apādāna, svāmyādi (the

1 kiriyākārakajāte 'assedam' iti bhāvahetumhi /
2 sambandhah kārakebhyo'nyah kriyākārakapūrvakah / śrutāyām aśrutāyām vā kriyāyām sa pratīyate //
Note that DT 2.4.19 quotes the same verse in its explanation of the word sambandha.

3 karmādibhyo'nyah prātipadikārthavyatirekah svassvāmibhāvasambandhādih śeṣah/
genitive relations such as owner-owned etc.) and adhikarana."

C uses the term sambandha to denote a genitive relation: ṣasthī sambandhe / (CV 2.1.95)
"The sixth case is employed after a noun in the sense of a nominal relation."

# C. 

In the matter of syntax, K has followed Śarva. Agg's statement that 'kärakas have their origin in case suffixes' destroys the whole purpose behind introducing this abstract level. In the Sadd's Padamālā, Agg's inclusion of bhāva as one of the kārakas is unique in itself and is without parallel in Sanskrit. Though Agg has generally accepted K's definitions, he has also tried to incorporate additional information from various sources. Among his sources, the most probable source appears to be the DT. However, Agg's indebtedness to the Mbh, Bhartṛhari's Vākya and Helārāja's commentary on it cannot be completely ruled out. Mogg on the other hand has closely followed C and has abstained from defining any kāraka relation.
# Terminology Denoting Complex Formations 

## 1. vutti

## A.

The term vutti literally meaning 'mode of being or acting, conduct, practice, usage, livelihood, habit'1 is used by the grammarians to denote complex formations such as compounds, primary and secondary derivatives etc. Note that the Sanskrit tradition talks of five types of complex formations (yrtis). They are samāsa, taddhita, krdanta, ekaśeṣa and sanādyanta.

The term occurs only in MV and Sadd. At MV 3.69: sabbādayo vuttimatte, Mogg seems to use the term to express the complex formations like compounds and secondary derivatives. Cf. MVu 3.69:
"The feminine pronouns take the form similar to that of the masculine only in the case of complex formations, e.g., tassa mukham tammukham; tassam tatra; tāya tato; tassam velāyam tad $\bar{a}^{n} .^{2}$

At MVu 5.4: tumsmā lopo vīcchāyam te, it is also used of the desideratives. ${ }^{3}$ In the section dealing with compounds, Mogg has used the word several times as opposed to vākya (sentence). Cf. for instance, MVu 3.10:

1 S I.100, Sn 81, Ja VI.224, etc.
2 itthivācakā sabbādayo vuttimatte pumeva honti; tassa mukham tammukham; tassam tatra; tāya tato; tassam velāyam tadā/
3 katham kūlam pipatisatīti? yathā kūlam patitumicchatīti vākyam hoti; evam vuttipi hessati "How to explain the form kūlam pipatisati? As we have the sentence 'the bank is about to fall', in the same way, we can have the vutti (complex formation)".
vuttidevopapadasamāse - kumbhakāro; sapāko; tantavāyo; varāharo / ntamānaktavantāhi vākyameva; dhammam sunanto, dhammam sunamāno, odanam bhuktvā ... kvaci vuttiyeva; urago, pādapo / kvaci vākyameva; pharasunā chinnavā; dassanena pahātabbā/
Here it should be noted that Mogg has not used the term vutti in the context of primary derivatives. Apart from this, the treatment of ekasesa, which is considered to be one of the five vrttis by the Sanskrit grammarians, is absent in the MV.

Though the term vutti occurs at Sadd $157^{1}, 159^{2}$ and $164^{3}$, in all these places, it denotes a metrical composition but at Sadd 864: vicitrā taddhitavutti, it is used in the sense of a complex formation.

# B. 

In the Sanskrit tradition, vrtti is defined as parārthābhidhānam vrttih / ${ }^{4}$ (Mbh I.364). Commenting on this, Kaiyata says in the Pradīpa:
"Vrtti is that where the meaning of a word is expressed by another word". 5

Vrtti in the sense of complex formations occurs several times in the CVṭ. Cf.: CVṭ 2.2.16:
kvacid vrttir eva, kumbhakārah, śvapacah / ... iha
vrttir eva - pādābhyām hriyate pādahārakah /
vannaniyamo chando, garulahuniyamo vutti /
2 vuttānurakkhanattham viparītatā/
3 vuttirakkhane māgame /
4 "Expressing the meaning other than that of the constituents is called vrtti".
5 parasya sabdasya yo'rthas tasyābhidhānam sabdōntareṇa yatra sa vrttir ity arthah/
yathā kūlam patitum icchatīti vākyam bhavaty evaṃ vrttir api bhavisyati / (CVṛ 1.1.22)

# C. 

Thus, the term vutti in the sense of a complex formation is common to both the traditions.

## 2. samāsa

## A.

The literal meaning of the word samāsa is 'putting together'. Rüp explains the term samāsa as:
"That which is put together is called samāsa. It means that which is abridged". ${ }^{1}$

Elaborating on the term samāsa, Agg says:
"There, samāsa means 'putting together', i.e. an abridgement of words. Or, samāsa is putting together by way of words or meanings, either by eliding the case endings or without eliding them. Samāsa means a compounded word as the words are put together to form a single word. Compounding is characterised by coming together of many words into one". ${ }^{2}$

1 samassate ti samāso, sañhhipiyatī ti attho /
2 tattha samāso ti samasanaṃ samāso padasañkhepo, atha vā samasiyati saddavasena vā atthavasena vā vibhattilopuṃ katvā vā akatvā vā ekapadattakaraṇena sañhhipiyatī ti samāso samassitapadam / nānāpadānam ekapadattupagamanaṃ samāsalakkhamam /

Note that samasanaṃ samāso also occurs at DT 2.1.5: samasanaṃ samāsaḥ/
Further in the commentary, Agg points out that
"According to some, 'distinct meanings turning into one meaning' is a characteristic of compounding". ${ }^{1}$

Note that this is the view expressed in the MVu 3.1:
"Distinct meanings becoming one is called compounding". ${ }^{2}$

Cp. also the CVr 2.2.1:
"Distinct meanings becoming one, is called compounding". ${ }^{3}$

Note that a similar explanation also occurs at DT 2.1.5:
prthagarthānām ekārthībhāvah samāso bhavati /
K defines samāsa as: nāmānaṃ samāso yuttattho / (Kacc 318)
"A technical term samāsa denotes a connected meaning of nominals."

This is exactly identical with Kt 2.5.1: nāmnāṃ samāso yuktārthah / Commenting on Kacc 318, the Kacc-Vu says:
"Samāsa denotes conjoining of the meanings of nouns". ${ }^{4}$

Commenting on the word yuttattha, Rūp says:
"'Connected meaning' means having conjoined, coagulated, or connected meaning". ${ }^{5}$

Agg amplifies K's definition as: nämopasagganipātānaṃ yuttattho samāso / (Sadd 675)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 keci pana 'bhinnatthānam ekatthabhāvo samāsalakhanan' ti vadanti /
    2 bhinnatthänamekatthībhāvo samāso ti vuccate /
    3 prthagarthānām ekārthībhāvah samāsa ity ucyate /
    4 tesaṃ nāmānam payuijapadatthānaṃ yo yuttattho so samāsasañño hoti /
    5 yutto sangato sambandho va attho yassa soyaṃ yuttattho /
"Samāsa denotes a connected meaning of nouns, prefixes and particles."

Though Mogg uses the term samāsa in the rule pyo vā tvāssa samāse (MV 5.164), the usual term denoting a compound in his grammar is ekattha ${ }^{1}$ (a word having a single / unified meaning). At MV 3.1, Mogg defines a compound as: syādi syādīnekattham /
"A word ending in a nominal case ending combines with another word ending in a nominal case ending to form a compound (i.e. a word with a unified meaning)."

A similar definition is met with at CV 2.2.1: sup supaikārtham /

# B. 

Samāsa is derived from the root as 'to throw' preceded by the prefix sam 'together' with the suffix ghañ. Sam-as occurs at AV VI.89.3, ŚB X. 3 etc. in the sense of 'put together, add, combine'. Samāsa is used in its grammatical sense in Nir 2.2:
"Now with regard to words formed with the secondary suffixes and compounds whether of one or more than one member, one should explain their component parts in their respective order, having first divided the words into them". ${ }^{2}$

BD not only uses samāsa but mentions its six varieties also (II.105-106):

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ekatthatāyam (MV 2.121), syādi syādinekattham (MV 3.1), chatthīyekatthe kvaci napumsakattam hotekattañca (MVu 3.22), itthiyambhāsita pumitthi pumevekatthe (MV 3.67).

    2 atha taddhitasamāseṣv ekaparvasu cānekaparvasu ca pūrvam pūrvam aparaparam pravibhajya nirbrūyāt /
"Dvigu, dvandva, avyayībhāva, and karmadhāraya, the fifth bahuvrīhi and the sixth called tatpuruṣa are the (compounds)". ${ }^{1}$

P does not define samāsa but samarthah padavidhih ${ }^{2}$ (P 2.1.1)) is generally taken to be the definition of the term. P's rule prāk kadārāt samāsah (P 2.1.3) teaches that
"(The technical term) samāsa (a compound) denotes (all items resulting from the application of subsequent rules in this section) prior to (the sūtra kadāāāh karmadhāraye 2.2.38)".

Śarva defines samāsa as: nāmnāṃ samāso yuktārthah /
"A technical term samāsa denotes a syntactic connection of nominals." (Kt 2.5.1)

C uses ekārtham, which is abbreviated from ekārthībhāva, for samāsa. He, however, uses the term samāsa in cārthasamāsamanojñādibhyah (CV 4.1.149), osṭhotvoḥ samāse vā (CV 5.1.97), iko'sasthāne hrasvaś cāsamāse (CV 5.1.132) etc. C's rule defining a compound is: sup supā ekārtham / (CV 2.2.1)
"A word ending in a nominal case ending combines with another word ending in a nominal case ending to form a compound (i.e. a word with a unified meaning)."

# Types of Compounds 

Both, the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammarians, have classified the compounds into various types. In BD, we come across six types of compounds. They are dvigu, dvandva,

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dvigur dvandvo'vyayībhāvah karmadhāraya eva ca / pañcamas tu bahuvrīhih ṣaṣthas tatpuruṣah smrtah //
    2 "An operation on padas (takes effect) only when they are semantically and syntactically connected."
ayayibhāva, karmadhāraya, bahuvrīhi and tatpuruṣa. ${ }^{1}$ VP also provides a fourfold classification leaving out karmadhāraya and dvigu. ${ }^{2}$ This fourfold classification is generally adopted by all the grammars. Karmadhāraya and dvigu are generally treated as the subcategories of the tatpuruṣa compound.

Among the Pali grammarians, Agg has introduced a number of classifications of compounds based on their function, nature, designation and sub-categories:
"And that compound is twofold according to its function: a compound with elided case endings and a compound with unelided case endings. Similarly, twofold according to its nature: an obligatory and a non-obligatory (optional) compound. (It is) sixfold, according to its designations: avyayibhāva, kammadhāraya, digu, tappurisa, bahubbīhi and dvunda. And, (it is) twnenty-seven or twentyeightfold according to its subcategories". ${ }^{3}$

Let us now consider the six-fold classification of compounds in detail.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dvigur dvandvo'vyayibhāvah karmadhāraya eva ca / pañcamas tu bahuvrīhih ṣaṣthas tatpuruṣah smṛtah // (BD 2.105)
    2 catusprakārāh samāsāh avyayibhāvatatpuruṣadvandvabahuvrīhayah / "Compounds are of four types: avyayibhāva, tatpuruṣa, dvandva and bahuvrīhi." (Uvaṭa on VP 1.27)
    3 so ca samāso kiccavasena luttasamāso uluttasamāso ti duvidho, tathā sabhāvato niccasamāso uniccasamāso ti duvidho, saññāvasena avyayibhāvo kammadhārayo digu tappuriso bahubbīhi dvando cā ti chabbidho, pabhedavasena .attavisatividho atthavīsatividho bhavati / (Excurcus bet. Sadd 692 - 693)
# 3. avyayībhāva 

## A.

The name avyayibhāva is so apt that most systems of grammar have accepted it. In Pali, the usage of this term is restricted to the grammatical literature. Abyayibhāva / avyayībhāva ${ }^{1}$ denoting a type of compound probably occurred for the first time in Kacc 77, 154,222 etc. In Sadd, it is explained as:
"It brings out; it clarifies; it manifests the meaning of indeclinables, thus it is called an avyayibhāva". ${ }^{2}$

According to another analysis, a non-indeclinable turns into an indeclinable, thus it is called an avyayibhāva. ${ }^{3}$

K defines abyayibhāva as: upasagganipātapubbako abyayībhāvo / (Kacc 321)
"Abyayībhāva denotes a compound having a prefix or an indeclinable as its first member."

Agg improves upon K's definition by using the term avyaya, which is a wider category, representing both the prefixes and the particles (upasagga and nipāta): avyayapubbako avyayībhāvo /
"Avyayībhāva denotes a compound having an indeclinable as its first member." (Sadd 696)

Explaining it further, he says:
"A compound in which an indeclinable has a leading role or a compound in which an

[^0]
[^0]:    1 K uses abyayibhāva whereas Agg has avyayībhāva.
    2 avyayānam attham bhāveti vibhāveti pakāsetī ti avyayībhāvo / (Sadd 696) Cp. abyayānam attham vibhāvayatī ti abyayībhāvo / (Rüp 315)
    3 anabyayam abyayam bhavatī ti vā abyayībhāvo / (Rüp 315)
indeclinable is predominant that compound is an avyayibhāva". ${ }^{1}$

The same is also reflected in a statement:
"The meaning of the first member is predominant in these types of compounds". ${ }^{2}$

Sadd 697: tamsadiso ca extends the scope of this compound even to such compounded words, which behave like an avyayibhāva compound but do not contain an indeclinable:
"Because of an identical behaviour, a compound which is similar to an avyayibhāva compound is called an avyayibhāva compound." ${ }^{3}$

Following C, Mogg uses asamkhyattha for avyayibhāva: asamkkhyehi cāngulyānaññāsaṃkhyatthesu / (MV 3.44) Note that in Mogg's grammar, avyaya is expressed by asamkhya. However, at MV 2.122: pubbasmā mādito, an avyayibhāva is referred to as a compound that precedes an amädi compound. ${ }^{4}$ Here it should be noted that in Mogg's grammar, an avyayibhāva is taught before the tappurisa.

# B. 

Avyayibhāva is one of the bigger technical terms used by P. Commenting on the term Kāsikā says that it is a bigger selfexplanatory term indicating the predominance of a first member in

[^0]
[^0]:    1 avyayapurecaro avyayappadhāno sa. tāso avyayibhāvusamāso hoti / (Sadd 696)

    2 pubbapadatthappadhāno hi abyayibhāvo / (Rūp 315, Sadd 696)
    3 taggatikattā tena avyayibhā̃usamāsena sadiso ca samāso avyayībhāvasañño hoti / (Sadd 697)

    4 Note that in Mogg's grammar, the term denoting a tappurisa compound is amädi.
an avyayibhāva compound. ${ }^{1}$ According to DT 2.5.14, the term avyayibhāva is derived by adding the suffix cvi in the sense of abhütatadbhāva, to the word avyaya followed by the root $b h \bar{u}$ with an additional suffix $\underline{n} a .^{2}$

P abstains from any descriptive definition of an avyayibhāva. P 2.1.5: avyayibhāvah is a heading rule. What it claims is that
"(The technical term) avyayibhāva denotes all items derived by the application of subsequent rules." ${ }^{3}$

Śarva's definition of an avyayibhāva compound, which is in a verse form, runs as follows: pūrvam vācyam bhavet yasya so'vyayibhāva ucyate / (Kt 2.5.14)
"That of which the meaning of the first member becomes manifest that compound is called an avyayibhāva."

C uses asamkhyārtha for an avyayibhāva: śaradā̄dibhya'saṃkhyārthe (CV 4.4.90). It may be mentioned in this connexion that C uses asamkhya for P's avyaya.

# 4. tappurisa 

## A.

The term tappurisa is taken as the type of compounds known by that name. The term is itself a tappurisa compound and is analysed as tassa puriso tappuriso. Compounds similar to this are also called as tappurisa. As the word tappurisa goes beyond the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 anvarthasaṃjñā ceyam mahatī pūrvapadārthaprādhānyam avyayībhāvasya darśayati / (Kāśikā 2.1.5)
    2 anavyayam avyayam bhavatīti bhavo napratyayaś cvāv asyettvam /
    3 yān ita ūrdhvam anukramiṣyāmah, avyayībhāvasaṃjñās te veditavyāh / (Kāśikā 2.1.5)
qualifying adjective i.e., differs from the case of the qualifying adjective, ${ }^{1}$ similarly, all the compounds of this type go beyond the qualifying term. Therefore, it is called a tappurisa. ${ }^{2}$

As a technical term of grammar, it does not have a canonical status and occurs first at Kacc 335. At Kacc 329, K defines tappurisa as amädayo parapadehi. Commenting on this, the Vutti says:
"When nouns ending in suffixes am etc. are compounded with the following nouns, that compound is called a tappurisa compound". ${ }^{3}$

Agg has also accepted K's definition. Sadd 704 states: amädayo samasiyanti parapadehi, so tappuriso /
"When nouns ending in suffixes am etc. are compounded with a following noun, that compound is called a tappurisa compound".

According to Agg, in this type of compounds, the meaning of a second member is predominant. ${ }^{4}$

Mogg has not used the term tappurisa. In his grammar, tappurisa is expressed as amädi ekattha. Cf. MV 2.122 and 3.10.

1 This is no doubt a peculiar description of a tappurisa compound. It focusses on the basic difference between tappurisa and kammadhāraya types of compounds. Kammadhāraya, which is considered as a sub-category of the tappurisa types of compounds, differs from it as both the members of this type of compounds are in the same case and refer to one and the same object, e.g., nīlain kamalam, nilakamalam (a blue lotus). However, in case of the tappurisa type of compounds, the case of a qualifying adjective always differs from that of the qualified noun, e.g., rañño puriso räjapuriso (a royal officer).

2 tassa puriso tappuriso, tappurisasadisattā ayam pi samāso tappuriso ti vuccati, yathā hi tappurisasaddo gunam ativatto, tathā sukalo p'-uyum samāso gunam ativatto, tasmā tappuriso ti vuccati / (Sadd 704)
3 te amädayo nämehi parapadehi yadā sumassante tadā so samāso tappurisasañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 329)
4 uttarapadatthappadhāno hi tappuriso / (Sadd 704)
However, at MV 3.44: asamkhyehi cāngulyānaññasamkhyatthesu, tappurisa is expressed as anaññāsamkhyattha (except in a bahubbīhi and an avyayibhāva). Cp. asamkhyāc cānguler ananyāsamkhyārthe (CV 4.4.74). Mogg's rule defining this type of compound is amādi / (MV 3.10)
"A noun ending in the nominal case ending am etc. is compounded with another noun ending in the nominal case ending $s i$ etc."

Agg recognises three main varieties of the tappurisa compounds. They are suddhatappurisa (pure tappurisa), kammadhāraya (Skt. karmadhāraya) and digu (Skt. dvigu). ${ }^{1}$ Kacc 328 (ubhe tappurisā) and Sadd 707 (te ca ubho), teach:
"The compounds digu and kammadhāraya are called tappurisa". ${ }^{2}$

Agg further classifies tappurisa into seven types on the basis of the seven vibhattis:
vitthārato pana paṭhamātappuriso dutīyātappuriso cha cā ti satta tappurisā bhavanti / (Sadd 707)

# B. 

As in case of an avyayibhāva, P defines tatpuruṣa by way of enumeration and does not involve in any sort of descriptive definition. P's rule: tatpuruṣah (P 2.1.22), is a heading rule. It teaches that
"(The technical term) tatpuruṣa (applies to the compounds formed by subsequent rules)."
Commenting on this rule, the Kāsikā says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 suddhatappuriso kammadhārayatappuriso digutappuriso ti tayo tappurisā / (Sadd 707)
    2 ubhe digukammadhārayasamāsā tappurisasaññā honti / (Kacc-Vu 328)
"It is a bigger technical term coined by the earlier teachers. Its acceptance is for the sake of including even its hyponyms (i.e. sub-varieties such as karmadhāraya, and dvigu). Tatpuruṣa is a compound having the predominance of the meaning of the final member". ${ }^{1}$

Sarva defines a tatpuruṣa compound as:
"When case endings from the second onwards are compounded with a following noun, that compound is to be known as a tatpuruṣa compound." ${ }^{2}$

C generally expresses tatpuruṣa by ananyāsaṃkhya i.e., except in a bahuvrīhi and an avyayībhāva. Cf. asamkhyāc cānguler ananyāsaṃkhyārthe (CV 4.4.74). C's rule defining this type of compounds is kārakam bahulam (CV 2.2.16). Note that due to this wording, the later authors such as Subhūti ${ }^{3}$ etc. refer to the tatpuruṣa as a kārakasamāsa.

As said before, the Sanskrit grammarians generally treat karmadhāraya and dvigu as the sub-categories of tatpuruṣa. Cf.: tatpuruṣah samānādhikaraṇah karmadhārayah ${ }^{4}$ (P 1.2.42), dviguś $c a^{5}$ (P 2.1.23); tatpuruṣāv ubhau ${ }^{6}$ (Kt 2.5.7).

3 sup supaikārtham (CV 2.2.1) iti samāsah / kārakasamāsah / (Subhūticandra on Amarakośa 1.1.52)
4 "(The technical term) karmadhāraya denotes a tatpuruṣa compound formed from coordinate padas".

5 "(The technical term tatpuruṣa samāsa) also denotes (the compound) named dvigu".

6 "Both the dvigu and the karmadhāraya compounds are to be known as the tatpuruṣa compound".
# 5. kammadhāraya 

## A.

The term kammadhāraya is met with only in the grammatical literature beginning with Kacc. It is analysed as:
"It bears two things just as a kamma. Thus, it is a kammadhāraya. As the kamma bears both the action as well as its purpose, because when the kamma exists, there is a possibility of an action and its purpose. Similarly, this compound bears two names conveying the same meaning. When this type of compound is there, it is possible to have two nouns having the same meaning. Thus, it is said that 'it bears two just as a kamma, thus, it is a kammadhāraya'". ${ }^{1}$

K defines kammadhāraya as: dvipade tulyādhikaraṇe kammadhārayo / (Kacc 326)
"When two coordinate words (denoting the same substratum) ${ }^{2}$ are compounded, that compound is called kammadhāraya." ${ }^{3}$

Agg accepts K's definition. Sadd 702 states:

1 kammam iva dvayaṃ dhāretī ti kammadhārayo, yathā kammaṃ kiriyaṃ ca payojanaṃ ca dvayaṃ dhārayati, kamme sati kiriyāya payojanassa ca sambhavato, tathā ayaṃ samāso ekassa atthassa dve nāmāni dhārayati asmiṃ samāse sati ekatthajotakassa nāmadvayassa sambhavato iti kammam iva dvayaṃ dhārayatī ti kammadhārayo ti vuccati / (Sadd 702; Rüp 324)
2 tulyam samānam adhikaranam attho yassa padadvayassa tam tulyādhikaraṇam / (Rüp 324)
3 dve padāni tulyādhikaraṇāni yadā samassante tadā so samāṣo kammadhārayasañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 326)
dve padāni samasīyanti tulyādhikaraṇāni, so kammadhārayo /
"When two coordinate words (denoting the same substratum) are compounded, that compound is called kammadhāraya."

Following C, Mogg has not used any special name for this type of compound. However, visesanamekatthena ${ }^{1}$ (MV 3.11) is his rule defining a kammadhāraya type of compounds. This rule has a striking similarity with CV 2.2.18: viśeṣaṇam ekārthena /

Agg provides a nine-fold classification of the kammadhāraya compound. The nine types of the kammadhāraya are: visesanapubbapado (the one having an adjective as its first member), visesanuttarapado (the one having an adjective as its final member), visesanobhayapado (the one in which both the members are adjectives), upamänuttarapado (having the means of comparison as its second member), sambhāvunā-pubbapado (having the word denoting an idea as its first member) ${ }^{2}$, avadhāranapubbapado (having the determinate object as its first member), nanipātapubbapado (having the particle na as its first member), kupubbapado (having the indeclinable $k u$ as its first member), and pādipubbapado (having the prefixes pa etc. as its first member).

# B. 

Abhirāma Vidyālañkāra in the Sañkṣiptasāraṭippaṇī says:
"Karmadhāraya is so called as it bears the karma i.e. a connection with an action." ${ }^{3}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Note that the word ekattha here is equivalent to samānādhikarana / tulyādhikarana: visesanaṃ syādyantam, visessena syādyantena samānādhikaranena sahekattham hoti / (MVu 3.11)
    2 For instance, dhammo ti buddhi dhammabuddhi.
    3 karma kriyānvayaṃ dhārayatīti karmadhārayah /
P defines karmadhāraya as: tatpuruṣah samānādhikaraṇah karmadhārayah / (P 1.2.42)
"(The technical term) karmadhāraya denotes a tatpuruṣa compound formed from coordinate padas."

At Kt 2.5.5, Śarva defines karmadhāraya as:
pade tulyādhikaraṇe vijñeyah karmadhārayah /
"A compound in which both the words have the same meaning, ${ }^{1}$ that compound is to be known as a karmadhāraya." ${ }^{2}$

# 6. digu 

## A.

Digu is another term, like tappurisa, representing a class of compounds similar to it. It is a sub-category of the kummadhāraya type of compounds. Agg and Buddhappiya, the author of Rūp analyse the word digu as an instance of a digu compound: dve gāvo digu / (Sadd 703)
"Digu = a collection of two cows."
Compounds similar to the compound digu are also called by the same name. As the word digu has a numeral at its initial position and as it is a neuter singular, similarly compounds of this type also have a numeral at the initial position and they are generally neuter in gender and singular in number. Therefore, on

[^0]
[^0]:    1 avyutpanna iha tulyaśabdah ekuparyāyah / adhikaranam artha ucyate / (DV 2.5.5)
    2 yatra samāse dve pade tulyādhikaraṇe bhavatah, sah karmadhārayo vijñeyah / (DV 2.5.5)
account of being similar to the word digu, such compounds are also called digu. ${ }^{1}$ Cp. Rüp 333:
"Or, it is called digu as it is understood; comprehended by way of two characteristics, viz., a numeral at an initial position and a neuter gender with a singular number". ${ }^{2}$

K and Agg define digu as: samkhyāpubbo digu /
"A kammadhāraya compound having a numeral in an initial position is called a digu compound."3 (Kacc 327, Sadd 703)

Following C, Mogg uses the term samkhyādi for digu: samkhyādi (MV 3.21). Cp. CV 2.2.76: saṃkhyādiḥ samāhāre /

# B. 

As said earlier, dvigu is a generic term for those karmadhārayas in which the first member is a numeral. The Prakriyāsarvasva explains the term thus:
dvayor gāvor bhavādir hi dvigur yatraiva sa dviguḥ /
"Where there is an existence of two cows or bullocks that is dvigu and the same is the name taken for the compound".

P's definition of dvigu runs as follows: saṃkhyāpūrvo dviguḥ /

[^0]
[^0]:    1 digusadisattā ayaṃ samāso digū ti vuccati, yathā hi digusaddo samkhyāpubbo c' eva hoti napuṃsakekavacano ca, evam eva ayam pi samāso saṃkhyāpubbo c' eva hoti yebhuyyena napuṃsakekavacano ca, tasmā digusadisattā digū ti vuccati / (Sadd 703)
    2 atha vā saṃkhyāpubbantanapuṃsakekattasañkhātehi dvīhi lakkhaṇehi gato avagato ti digū ti vuccati; dvīhi vā lakkhaṇehi gacchati pavattatī ti pi digu / 3 saṃkhyāpubbo kammadhārayasamāso digusañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 327)
"(The technical term) dvigu denotes (a compound) whose first member is a number word." (P 2.1.52)

Śarva defines a dvigu compound as: saṃkhyāpūrvo dvigur iti jñeyah / (Kt 2.5.6)
"A karmadhāraya compound having a numeral at an initial position is to be known as dvigu."

# 7. bahubbīhi 

## A.

Bahubbīhi is another generic term used for similar type of compounds. Agg analyses the term bahubbīhi as: bahavo vihayo assā ti bahubbīhi /1 (Sadd 708). Further, he adds:
"On account of being similar to the term bahubbīhi, such a type of compound is also called bahubbīhi. Just as the term bahubbīhi is used with respect to someone having that attribute, similarly, all such compounds are used with respect to someone possessing that attribute. Therefore, on account of being similar to the term bahubbīhi, such a compound is called bahubbīhi". ${ }^{2}$

In a bahubbīhi compound, the meaning other than that of its constituents is predominant. ${ }^{3}$

K defines bahubbīhi as: aññapadatthesu bahubbīhi / (Kacc 330)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "The one having lots of grain."
    2 bahubbīhisadisattā ayam pi samāso bahubbīh̄̄ ti vuccati; yathā hi bahubbīhisaddo gunini thito, tathā sakalo p' ayam samāso gunini thito, tena bahubbīhisadisattā bahubbīh̄̄ ti vuccati / (Sadd 708)
    3 aññapadatthappadhāno hi bahubbīhi / (Sadd 708)
"When nouns are compounded in such a way that they convey the sense other than themselves, that compound is called bahubbīhi." ${ }^{1}$

Sadd 708: bahubbīh'aññapadatthe echoes the same thought.
Following C, Mogg uses the term aññattha to express a bahubbīhi. Cf.: MV 3.31, 3.44, 3.49 etc. Mogg's rule defining this type of compound is: vānekaññatthe / (MV 3.17)
"More than one nominal ending in a nominal case ending si etc. are compounded in the sense of another word."

This has a striking similarity with CV 2.2.46: anekam anyārthe /
Kacc-Vu 330 on aññapadatthesu bahubbīhi, talks of two types of a bahubbīhi: tulyādhikaraṇa bahubbīhi and bhinnādhikaraṇa bahubbīhi, which is equivalent to the samānādhikaraṇa and the vyadhikaraṇa bahuvrīhi of the Sanskrit grammarians. At Sadd 708, Agg talks of two more categories of a bahubbīhi: tagguṇasaṃviññāna and atagguṇasaṃviññāna, which are parallel to the tadguṇasaṃvijñāna and the atadguṇasaṃvijñāna bahurvrīhi of the Sanskrit grammarians. Apart from this, Agg also talks of nine additional varieties of this compound. They are: the one having two members (dvipado), the one of which the members are used in different cases (bhinnādhikaraṇo), having three members (tipado), having a negative particle $n a$ as its first member (nanipāta-pubbapado), having saha as its first member (sahapubbapado), having a word of comparison as its first member (upamāna-pubbapado), the one in which both the members are numerals (saṃkhyobhayapado), the one conveying the sense of the sub-directions (disantarālattho), and the one marked by an exchange (vyatihāralakkhaṇo). Apart from these, Agg also speaks

[^0]
[^0]:    1 aññesam padānam atthesu nāmāni yadā samassunte tadā so samāso bahubbihisañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 330)
of some more categories of a bahubbīhi such as bāhirattho, abāhirattho, dukkaramaggo and durājānamaggo, which are unparalleled in the Sanskrit tradition.

# B. 

The Prakriyāsarvasva says:
"That compound of which the dissolution is of the type of 'bahavo vrīhayo'sya' is called by that name". ${ }^{1}$

P's basic rule defining bahuvrīhi is: śeṣo bahuvrīhih /
"(The technical term) bahuvrīhi denotes residual (compounds)." (P 2.2.23)
Commenting on the word śeṣa, Kāśikā says:
"What is rest? Where no other compound is taught". ${ }^{2}$
This rule is followed by P 2.2.24: anekam anyapadārthe, which teaches that:
"Two or more (nominal padas can combine with each other) to denote something distinct (from what is implied by the constituent padas) (to form a bahuvrīhi)".

Śarva defines a bahuvrīhi as:
syātạ̣̄ yadi pade dve tu yadi vā syur bahūny api /
tāny anyasya padasyārthe bahuvrīhih // (Kt 2.5.9)
"If there would be two padas or even if there would be many, (when they are compounded) in the sense of another word, it is called a bahuvrīhi."

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bahavo vrīhayo'syeti yatra syāt sa tathocyate /
    2 kuśs ca śeṣah? yatrānyah samāso noktaḥ / (Kāśikā 2.2.23)
# 8. dvanda 

## A.

Dvanda (Skt. dvandva) is the reduplication of dva (dvarn dvam) and means 'two by two', 'two and two', hence 'a pair'. It is another generic term representing its class. It is a dvanda compound of numerals dve and $d v e$ :
dve ca dve cā ti dvando /
According to an alternate explanation, dvanda is so called because it conveys the sense of 'a pair'. ${ }^{1}$ According to Rüp 342, dvanda is a meaningful term and it applies to such compounds, which are similar in nature to the word dvanda. ${ }^{2}$

K defines dvanda as: nāmānaṃ samuccayo dvando / (Kacc 331)
"A collection of nouns is called dvanda."
The Vutti explains it as:
"A collection of nouns having the same case is called dvanda". ${ }^{3}$

Agg improves upon K's definition by incorporating the KaccVu. Sadd 709 runs: nānānāmānam ekavibhattikānaṃ samuccayo dvando /
"A collection of many nouns having the same case is called dvanda".

Explaining it further, Agg says:

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dvandattho vā dvando / (Rüp 342)
    2 dvandasadisattā ayaṃ samāso pi anvatthasaññāyaṃ dvando ti vuccati /
    3 nāmānamekavibhattikānaṃ yo samuccayo so dvandasañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 331)
"Here, two words are combined into one, thus it is called dvanda. In this compound, the meaning of both the terms is predominant". ${ }^{1}$

Following C, Mogg uses the expression cattha to express dvanda. Cf. MV 3.46, 3.64. Mogg's rule defining the dvanda compound is catthe / (MV 3.19)
"More than one nominal ending in the nominal case endings si etc. are compounded to convey the sense of the conjunctive particle $c a$."

Cp. CV 2.2.48: cārthe /

# B. 

P defines dvandva as: cārthe dvandvah / (P 2.2.29)
"(An unrestricted number of nominal padas combine with one another) to form a dvandva (compound and a part of the meaning is that expressed by) the particle $c a$ ('and')."

Śarva explains dvandva as:
dvandvah samuccayo nämnor bahūnāṃ vā'pi yo bhavet / (Kt 2.5.11)
"Dvandva is a collection of two or many nouns."

## C.

To conclude, the terminology used by K and Agg to denote a compound and its various categories, is similar to that of P and Sarva whereas the terminology adopted by Mogg is similar to that of C. With regard to the definition, K and Agg appear to follow Sarva whereas Mogg follows P and C. Agg's classification of

[^0]
[^0]:    1 dve dve padāni ekato samodhānum ettha gucchantī ti dvando, so ubhayapadatthapudhāno / (Sadd 709)
various types of compounds reminds us of the sumāsacakra type of literature.

# 9. ekasesa 

## A.

Ekasesa is a grammarians' term denoting a grammatical operation in which many identical forms are reduced to a single one. The literal meaning of the term ekasesa is 'having a single remainder'. K and Agg have taught such an operation with regard to identical forms. Cf.: sarūpānamekasesvasakim (Kacc 390)1; bavhatthānapanicchāyaṃ sarūpānam ekaseso ${ }^{2}$ (Sadd 820). Note that commenting on Kacc 390, Rüp 68 talks of virūpekasesa 'ekasesa of un-identical forms'. Agg, however, has shown his reluctance for the ekasesa of the un-identical forms at Sadd 821: matantare virūpekaseso. Sadd 737: bahubbihimhi ca sarūpānam ekaseso teaches ekasesa of the identical words in the bahubbīhi and the dvanda compounds.

Mogg on the other hand has not dealt with the phenomenon of ekasesa and thus there was no opportunity for using the term.

## B.

P has used the term ekaśesa to denote the same phenomenon of part retaining. His rule sarūpānām ekaśeso ekavibhaktau (P 1.2.64) teaches ekaśesa of identical forms whereas rules P 1.2.65 - 1.2.73 teach ekaśesa of un-identical forms.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "When there is a multiple use of an identical expression, only one of them remains".
    2 "When there is a wish to express the plurality of the meaning, then only one of the many identical expressions remains".
Śarva and C do not deal with this phenomenon. Therefore, the term ekaśesa is missing in these two grammars. Cf. DT on Kt 2.4.17 and CV $\underline{r}$ on CV 2.2.87.

# C. 

To conclude, K and Agg seem to follow P with respect to the ekasesa of identical forms. They, however, differ from P on the issue of the ekasesa of un-identical forms (virüpekasesa). Following Sarva and C, Mogg has omitted the treatment of ekasesa.
# Terminology Denoting Various Grammatical Concepts 

## 1. linga (Grammatical gender)

## A.

The generic term denoting a grammatical gender is linga, in both the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. It basically meant 'a characteristic, an attribute, a mark'. ${ }^{1}$ From this, on the one hand, linga came to mean 'a mark of sex', ${ }^{2}$ on the other hand it came to signify 'a grammatical gender'. ${ }^{3}$

The Pali grammarians have accepted the term linga to denote a grammatical gender. ${ }^{4}$ Agg has tried to explain the concept of the gender with the help of a quotation from the Niruttimanjūusā:
tathā hi ayaṁ niruttiman̄jūsāyaṁ vutto : kim pan etaṁ lingaṁ nāma: keci tāva vadanti
thanakesavatī itthī, massuvā puriso siyā /
ubhinnam antaram etam itarobhayamuttako ti //
... apare vadanti : na lingaṁ nāma paramatthato
kiñci atthi, lokasaṁketarūḷho pana vohāro lingaṁ
nāmā ti / ${ }^{5}$ (Sadd 221, 25)
1 M I.360; S V.278; Sn 601
2 Vin III. 35 (purisa-); Ja V. 197 (-saṇthāna); Pj I 110 (-itthī).
3 Pj II 397; Pv-a 7, 33, 58, 87, 157 (-vipallāsa).
4 Kacc 322; Sadd 144, 277, 307 etc.; MVu 4.69.
5 "Thus, this is what is said in the Niruttimanjūsā: What does this gender (linga) mean? Some people say: one with breasts and long hair is a female and the one having a beard is a male. This is the difference between the two. The rest (neuter) is neither of the two.
This is also the view held by the Sanskrit grammarians from Ptj onwards. Cp. Mbh II. 196:
stanakeśavatī strī syāl lomaśah puruṣah smṛtah /
ubhayor antaram yac ca tad tadabhāve napumsakam // ${ }^{1}$
There are three grammatical genders in Pali as well as in Sanskrit. They are expressed as: itthilinga / strilinga (feminine); pullinga (masculine); and napumsakalinga ${ }^{2}$ (neuter). However, in most of the cases, the Pali grammarians have favoured the use of the shorter terms, pum, ${ }^{3}$ itthi ${ }^{4}$ and napumsaka. ${ }^{5}$ Note that at MVu 3.22, Mogg has used napumsakattam to express neuter gender.

The three grammatical genders are defined by Agg at Sadd 193-195. Sadd 193 defines pullinga as: visadam pullingam /
"The word with clear characteristics is called a masculine gender". ${ }^{6}$
At Sadd 194, itthilinga is defined as: avisadam itthilingam /
"The word without clear characteristics is called a feminine gender".

Sadd 195 defines napuṃsakalinga as:
$n^{\prime}$ eva visadam nāvisadam napuṃsakalingam /

Others say: In reality, there exists nothing like a gender. It is merely a usage based on popular conventions".

1 "The one having breasts and long hair is a female, the one having hairs is reckoned as a male and when this distinction of the two is absent, then that is a neuter".

2 At Pv-a 266 it is used of the neuter gender.
3 Kacc 31, 333; Sadd 208, 280; MV 2.77, 3.67.
4 Kacc 131, 333; Sadd 206, 1140; MV 1.10, 3.26.
5 Kacc 85, 125; Sadd 208, 240; MV 2.68, 3.9.
6 visadam vacanam pullingaṃ nāma bhavati/
"The word with neither clear nor unclear characteristics is called a neuter gender".

The Sanskrit grammarians are generally of the opinion that the grammatical gender is not anything absolute, it is simply established by the popular conventions and that alone is a way to learn it. Thus, Ptj says:
"These terms such as strī, pumān, napumsaka, are established by the popular convention. When after observing the world, it is determined that this is feminine, this is masculine and this is neuter, then it is said: this is feminine, this is masculine and this is netuer."1 (Mbh II.195-196)

Cp. Kt 1.1.23: lokopacārād grahaṇasiddhih /

# B. 

To sum up, the term linga in the sense of a grammatical gender is common to both the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammatical tradition and same is also the case with the terms itthilinga / itthī, pullinga / pum and napumsakalinga / napuṃsaka. Agg is the only Pali grammarian who has provided the definitions for all the three genders.

## A.

The word bhāva is derived from the root $b h \bar{u}$ and literally means 'being, becoming, condition, nature' etc. In grammar, the word is used in two distinct senses that of an action and a state or an abstract condition. For instance, in rules such as $k \bar{c} l a b h \bar{a} \bar{v} e s u c a$
1 lokata ete śabdāh prasiddhāh strī pumān napuṃsakam iti / yal loke drș̣̣vaitad avasīyata iyaṃ stry ayam pumān idaṃ napuṃsakam iti sā strī sa pumāṃs tan napuṃsakam iti /
(Kacc 315, Sadd 644); yabbhāvo bhāvalakkhanam (MV 2.36) etc. $b h \bar{a} v a$ denotes an action. So read the commentaries:
"Bhāva denotes an action."1
"Bhāva denotes an action which is also said to be the meaning of a verbal root." ${ }^{2}$

The same idea is amplified at Kacc-Vn on Kacc 655:
"Bhāva is the pure meaning of a verbal root unmingled with any kāraka." ${ }^{3}$

In view of the Pali grammarians, bhāva in the sense of an action is also one of the kārakas. Note that in the same context, Agg uses the term bhāvasādhana at Sadd 626: bhāvasādhanādiyoge. In this connection, it would be interesting to consider the two passages of the Padamālā of the Sadd:
"Kamma, kattar, and bhāva: thus kārakas are threefold". 4
"Thus, in this context, the six sādhanas have been promulgated as bhāva, kattar, kamma, karana, apādāna, and adhikarana; they are sevenfold with that sādhana which is the sumpadāna". ${ }^{5}$

Bhāva denotes a state or an abstract condition in rules nyattatā bhāve tu (Kacc 362); nya-tta-ttana-vya-tā bhāve (Sadd 780); and tassa bhāvakammesu ttatättanaṇyaṇeyyaṇiyaṇiyā (MV 4.59) etc. Explaining the usage of the term bhāva here, Mogg says:

1 bhāvo nāma kiriyā / (Rūp 312)
2 bhāvo nāma kiriyā/sa dhārvattho ti pi vuccati / (Sadd 644)
3 bhāvo ti suddho, kārakehi asammisso dhā̄vattho /
4 kammaṃ kattā ca bhāvo ca icc evaṃ kārakā tidhā / (Padamālā 20,33)
5 evam ettha bhāvakattukammakarañāpādānādhikaraṇavasena cha sādhanāni pakāsitāni, tāni sumpadānasādhanena sattavidhāni bhavanti / (Padamālā 68,30-69,2)
"The abstract nouns are formed out of it. Thus, it is called bhāva. It is the cause of manifestation of the word". ${ }^{1}$

Further, the Vutti extends:
"The state of a blue cloth is called nīlattam. The quality blueness is the bhāva, the state of the blue quality is nillattam. Nīlatā is the universal of the blue quality. Cow-ness or cow-hood is a universal of cow. Pācakattam, dandittam, visānittam, rājapurisattam etc. is a state of an association with an action. Devadattattam, candattam, suriyattam is a universal of that particular condition. $\bar{A} k a \bar{s} s a t t a m$, abhāvattam etc. is the universal of the superimposed distinctions". ${ }^{2}$

This has a striking similarity with the explanation of bhāva occurring at CVr and DV:
sabdasya pravṛttinimittam / bhavato'smād abhidhānapratyayāv iti bhāvah / suhklasya patasya bhāvah suhklatvaṃ suklateti guṇo bhāvah / suhklasya gunasya bhāvah suhklatvaṃ suhklateti suhklagunajātih / gotvaṃ goteti gojātih / pācakatvam, danditvam, visā̄nitvam, rājapurusatvam iti kriyādisambandhitvam / devadattatvam, candratvam, sūryatvam iti tadavasthāvisesasāmānyam / ākāsatvam abhāvatvam ity upacāritabhedasāmānyam / (CVṛ 4.1.136)

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhavanti etasmā buddhisaddāti bhāvo, saddassa pavattinimittam / (MVu 4.59)

    2 nīlassa patassa bhāvo nīlattam, nīlatāti guṇo bhāvo nīlassa gunassa bhāvo nīlattam nīlatāti nīlagunajāti; gottam gotāti gojāti / pācakattam dandittam visānittam rājapurisattanti kriyādisambandhittam / devadattattam candattam suriyattanti tadavatthāvisesasāmaññam / ākāsattam abhāvattanti upacāritabhedasāmaññam /
sabdasya pravrttinimittam bhāvah / bhāve'bhidheye tatvau bhavatah / suuklasya patasya bhāvah suuklatā, suuklatvam iti suuklagunabhāvah / suuklasya gunasya bhāvah suuklatā, suuklatvam iti suuklagunajātih / gotā, gotvam iti gojātih / pācakatvam, danditvam, vişănitvam, rājapuruṣatvam, kriyādisambandhitvam / devadattatvam, candratvam, sūryatvam ity avasthābhedāt / ākāśatvam iti pradeśabhedāt / (DT 2.6.13)

# B. 

Bhāva is an older term going back to the time of Upaniṣads. In Nir, Y says:
"The verb has 'becoming' as its fundamental notion." ${ }^{1}$

Here bhāva denotes an action, which can be divided into parts. In most systems of the Sanskrit grammar, bhāva denotes two meanings: an action and a state or an abstract condition. At P 2.3.37: yasya ca bhāvena bhāvalaksañam, bhāva occurs in the sense of an action. Cf. Kāśikā on P 2.3.37: bhāvah kriyā / Note that a parallel rule in C's grammar reads: yatkriyā kriyācihnam / (CV 2.1.90)

Commenting on the rule kālabhāvayoh saptamī (Kt 2.4.34), DT remarks:
"Bhāva is an action. Vyāpāra is its synonym". ${ }^{2}$
P uses bhāva in the sense of a state or an abstract condition at P 5.1.119: tasya bhāvas tvatalau. Cf. Kāśikā on the same rule:
"That on account of which a particular expression and understanding comes into being, is bhāva. By

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhāvapradhānam ākhyātam / (Nir 1.1)
    2 bhāvah kriyā (bhavana) vyāpāra iti paryāyah / (DT 2.4.34)
the word bhāva is conveyed the reason for the use of a certain word". ${ }^{1}$

Also cp. CVṛ on CV 4.1.136: tasya bhāvas tvatalau:
bhavato'smād abhidhānapratyayāv iti bhāvah / sabdasya pravrttinimittam /
Also cp. DT on Kt 2.6.13: tatvau bhāve:
bhavato yasmāt buddhiśabdau sa bhāva iha grhyate / yasmād gotvāder viśeṣanatvād viśeṣye gavādau gaur ityevamādikah śabdo gotvād gor ākārānugatā ca buddhih gavāder ity āha - śabdasya pravrttinimittam bhāva iti /

# C. 

The term bhāva is commonly used by both the Pali as well as the Sanskrit grammarians. From the parallelisms shown in the above discussion, it is quite clear that in the usage and the explanation of the term bhāva, the Pali grammarians have closely followed the Sanskrit grammarians.

## 3. Technical Terminology Denoting the Past, the Present, and the Future

## A.

Kāla, literally 'time' is a generic term denoting the concept of the tense. The Pali grammarians have used this term in its technical as well as non-technical sense. For instance, in the rule kāladdhānam accantasaṃyoge (Kacc 300, Sadd 581, MV 2.3), it is used in the sense of time, whereas in rules: kāle vattamānātīte ṇvādayo (Kacc 652); and linga-vibhatti-vacana-kāla-puris'-

[^0]
[^0]:    1 bhavato'smād abhidhānapratyayāv iti bhāvah / śabdasya pravrttinimittam bhāvaśabdenocyate /
akkharānaṃ vipallāso (Sadd 672), it is used in the sense of tense. Mogg has not used the term kāla in its technical sense.

As for the Sanskrit grammars, there are many instances of the non-technical usage of the term kāla in different grammatical schools. Cf. for instance, kālādhvanor atyantasaṃyoge (P 2.3.5); kālabhāvayoh saptamī (Kt 2.4.34) and kālāt (CV 4.1.92). The term in its technical sense is, however, missing in Ast and CV. It is believed that the la of the word kāla has led P to use the ten technical terms lat, lit, lut, lṛt, let, lot, luñ, lin, luñ, and lṛn. C has followed P in this regard. Sarva uses the term kāla in its technical sense at Kt 3.1.21: kriyāsamabhihāre sarvakāleṣu madhyamaikavacanam pañcamyāh /

In Pali, the terms denoting the past, the present and the future tenses are atīta / bhūta, vattamāna / paccuppanna and anāgata / bhavissat. Note that the terms atīta (past, gone by), paccuppanna (existing, present) and anāgata (not arrived, future) come from the Pali Buddhist literature. When these three are referred together, the general order of the terms is atīt-anāgata-paccuppanna. Cf. D III.100; S II.26, 110, 252; III.19, 47, 187; A I.264; It 53; Nidd 22.

K and Agg use the term atīta to denote the past tense. Cf. kāle vattamānātīte ṇvādayo (Kacc 652) ${ }^{1}$ and vattamānātītesu nuu-yu-tā̄ (Sadd 1288). The term is, however, missing in MV. Mogg uses bhūta to denote the past tense at MV 5.55: kattari bhūte ktavantu ktāvī, ${ }^{3}$ and MV 6.4: bhūte $i$ um o ttha im mha a u se vham a mhe. ${ }^{4}$

[^0]
[^0]:    1 "Suffixes nu etc. are added after a verbal root to denote the present or the past tense".

    2 "Suffixes nu, yu and $t \bar{a}$ are added after a verbal root to denote the present or the past tense".

    3 "The suffixes ktavantu and ktāvī are added to a verbal root referring to a past action in the sense of an agent".

    4 "The suffixes $i$, um etc. are added to a verbal root referring to the past action".
The Pali grammarians have identified three types of past tenses, which are past imperfect, aorist and past perfect. Past imperfect is expressed as hiyoppabhuti atīta or anajjatana bhūta (general past tense excluding the current day). ${ }^{1}$ Aorist is expressed as ajjapabhuti atīta / bhūta (general past tense including the current day). ${ }^{2}$ Past perfect is expressed as apaccakkha atīta or parokkha bhūta (general past time beyond the perception of the speaker). ${ }^{3}$

K and Agg use the term paccuppanna to denote the present tense. Cf. vattamānā paccuppanne (Kacc 416) and paccuppanne kāle vattamānā ${ }^{4}$ (Sadd 872). The term is missing in MV. At MV 5.64: nto kattari vattamāne ${ }^{5}$ and MV 6.1: vattamāne ti anti si tha mi ma te ante se vhe e mhe ${ }^{6}$, Mogg uses the term vattamāna for the present tense. Here, it should be noted that K and Agg also use the term vattamāna to denote the present tense. Cf. vattamāne mänantā̄ (Kacc 567); vattamāne vippakatavacane män'antā8

1 hiyoppabhuti atīte kāle paccakkhe vā apaccakkhe vā hīyattunī vibhatti hoti / (Kacc-Vu 420); paccakkhe vā hiyyo pabhuti hīyyattanī / (Sadd 886); avijjamānajjatane bhūte'the vattamānato kriyatthā a ādayo honti / (MVu 6.5)
ajjappabhuti atīte kāle paccakkhe vā apaccakkhe vā sumīpe ajjatanī vibhatti hoti / (Kacc-Vu 421, Sadd 887); bhūte i um o ttha im mha a u se vham a mhe / (MV 6.4)
apaccakkhe atīte kāle parokkhā vibhatti hoti / (Kacc-Vu 419); apaccakkhe'tīte parokkhā / (Sadd 885); parokkhe a u e ttha a mha ttha re ttho vho i mhe / (MV 6.6)
"The finite verbal endings denoted by the term vattamānā are added to a verbal root referring to the present action".

5 "The suffix nto is added after a verbal root referring to the present action in the sense of an agent".

6 "Suffixes $t i$, anti etc. are added after a verbal root to refer to the present action".

7 "Suffixes māna and nta are added after a verbal root to refer to the present action".

8 "Suffixes māna and nta are added after a verbal root to refer to the present and an incomplete-action".
(Sadd 1157). In MVu 6.1, the present is explained as äraddhäparisamatta. This has a striking similarity with Rüp 630, ${ }^{1}$ Kt 3.1.11² and Kāśikā 3.2.123. ${ }^{3}$

All the three Pali grammarians have used the term anägata to denote the future tense. Cf. anägate bhavissanti (Kacc 423, 892)4 and te ssapubbänägate ${ }^{5}$ (MV 5.67). Besides these, the Pali grammarians have also used the term bhavissanta to express the future tense. Cf. bhavissati gamädīhi nighinam ${ }^{6}$ (Kacc 653); bhavissati käle ņi ghin gamädito ${ }^{7}$ (Sadd 1289) and bhavissati ssati ssanti ssasi ssatha ssāmi ssāma ssate ssante ssase ssavhe ssam ssāmhe ${ }^{8}$ (MV 6.2). MVu 6.2 explains the future as: bhavissati anäraddhe atthe / ${ }^{9}$

As per the Sanskrit tradition, P and C use bhüta to denote the past tense. Cf. bhūte / (P 3.2.84, CV 1.2.62)
"(When an action refers to) the general past."

1 äraddho uparisamatto attho vattamäno / "Present is that which has commenced but yet an incomplete action."

2 prārabdhäparisamäptakriyālakṣaṇh sampratīty ucyate /
3 ärabdho'parisamäptaś ca vartamānah /
4 "The finite verbal endings denoted by the term bhavissanti are added after a verbal root to denote a future tense."

5 "Those suffixes nta and mäna preceded by ssa are added after a verbal root to denote a future tense".

6 "The suffixes $n i$ and ghinam are added after the verbal roots gamu etc. to denote a future tense".

7 Same as above.
8 "The suffixes ssati ssanti etc. are added after a verbal root to denote a future tense".

9 "In the sense of a future action, which is yet to commence".
In Ast and CV , the terms denoting three types of the past tense are: anadyatana bhūta ${ }^{1}$ for the imperfect past, bhūta ${ }^{2}$ for aorist and parokṣa bhūta ${ }^{3}$ for the past perfect.

Śarva uses bhūta and atīta to express the past tense. Cf. smenätīte (Kt 3.1.12), bhūtakaraṇavatyaś ca (Kt 3.1.14).

P and C use vartamāna to denote the present tense. Cf. vartamāne lat / (P 3.2.123, CV 1.2.82)
"When an action refers to the present time, $l$ substitutes of lat 'present tense' are introduced (after a verbal stem)."
Commenting on P's rule, the Kāśikā says:
ārabdho'parisamāptaś ca vartamānah /4
Śarva uses sumprati to express the present tense. Cf. sumprati vartamānā/5 (Kt 3.1.11)

In Aṣt and CV, the term denoting the future tense is bhavisyat. Cf. bhavisyati gamyādayah / (P 3.3.3)
"(The class of expressions) beginning with 'intends to go' are introduced when the action refers to the general future."

1 anadyatane lañ / "(When an action refers to a general past tense) excluding the current day (the $l$-substitutes of lañ 'imperfect tense' are introduced (after a verbal stem)." (P 3.2.111, CV 1.2.77)
2 luñ / "(When an action refers to a general past tense the $l$-substitutes of) luñ 'aorist' are introduced (after a verbal stem)." (P 3.2.110, CV 1.2.76)
3 parokse lit / "(When an action refers to a general past time excluding the current day) and beyond the perception of the speaker, $l$-substitutes of lit are introduced (after a verbal stem)." (P 3.2.115, CV 1.2.81)
4 "The present time is that which has commenced but yet to finish".
5 "Verbal case endings denoted by the term vartamānā are added after a verbal root referring to a present action".
bhavisyati lṛt / (CV 1.3.2)
"When the action refers to the general future time, ( $l$-substitutes of) lṛt are introduced (after a verbal stem)."

Śarva also uses bhavisyat to denote the future. Cf.: bhavisyati bhavisyanty āsīhśvastanyah / ${ }^{1}$ (Kt 3.1.15)

# B. 

The technical terminology used by the Pali grammarians to denote tenses is of two types: the terms such as bhūta, vattamāna and bhavissanta have their parallels in the Sanskrit grammars whereas the terms such as atīta, anāgata and paccuppanna, seem to be taken over from the Pali literature.

1 "The verbal case endings denoted by the terms bhavisyantī, āsīh and śvastanī are added after a verbal root referring a future action."
# Miscellaneous Terms 

## 1. abbhāsa

## A.

Abbhāsa (Skt. Abhyāsa) is derived from the root as preceded by abhi meaning 'to throw towards, repeat' and means 'repetition'. ${ }^{1}$ It seems that this meaning was lost to the Pali commentators. Note that the Kacc-Vn explains the term abbhāsa as: atirekaṃ katvā bhāsīyatī ti abbhāso / (Kacc-Vṇ 461)
"It is uttered exceedingly. Thus, it is called abbhāsa."

Abbhāsa has no history in the Pali literature. It is quite conspicuous that the Pali grammarians have borrowed it from their Sanskrit counterparts.

K and Agg define abbhāsa in an identical fashion as: pubbobbhāso / (Kacc 461, Sadd 940)
"The technical term abbhāsa denotes the initial portion of the reduplicated root." ${ }^{2}$

This definition of K and Agg agrees verbatim with the definition of P and Kt. Cf. pürvo'bhyāsah (P 6.1.4, Kt 3.3.4). Following the footsteps of C, Mogg uses dvitte pubbo for abbhāsa. Thus, for abbhāse vattamānassa sarassa rasso hoti (Kacc-Vu 462), MVu has dvitte pubbassa saro rasso hoti. (MVu 5.74)

## B.

As said before, in Sanskrit, the literal meaning of the term abhyāsa is 'repetition'. In this sense, it is also used in the Ast's

1 anabhyāsam eke / (ĀŚS 3.1.11)
2 dvebhūtassa dhātussa yo pubbo so abbhāsasañño hoti / (Kacc-Vu 461, Sadd 940)
rule mithyopapadāt kṛño'bhyāse (P 1.3.71). Commenting on the term abhyāsa, the Kāsikā says:
"Abhyāsa means doing again and again, i.e. repetition". ${ }^{1}$

From this, it easily passes on to its technical sense of 'reduplication', which is first found in the Nir:
"Kakṣah (armpit) is derived from (the root) gāh (to
plunge into) with the suffix ksa, or from khy $\bar{a}$ (to
make known) with redundant reduplication."
In the Aṣt, the term abhyāsa is restricted to the initial reduplicated portion of the root: pürvo'bhyāsah (P 6.1.4). Śarva uses the term in exactly the same sense. Cf. Kt 3.3.4: pürvo'bhyāsah / For abhyāsa, C uses dvitve pūrvah. Cf. dvitve pūrvasyāsame (CV 5.3.84) corresponding to P's abhyāsasyāsavame (P 6.4.78).

# C. 

The usage of the term abbhāsa is limited to the Pali grammatical literature. The Pali grammarians have borrowed this term from Sanskrit. In this case, K and Agg have followed P and Sarva. Mogg, on the other hand, has followed C and has avoided its use.

## 2. upapada

## A.

Upapada literally means 'near a word, a word standing near (another word), a word preceding or following'. In this connection, it should be noted that this term is also borrowed from the Sanskrit grammars. K and Agg have used the term in its literal sense of

[^0]
[^0]:    1 abhyāsah punah punah karanam, āuṛttih /
    2 kakṣo gāhateh, ksa iti nāmakaranaḥ, khyāter vā'narthako'bhyāsah / (Nir 2.2)
'near a word'. ${ }^{1}$ This would be clear from Agg's explanation of the rule Sadd 682: upapade dhātumayānaṃ niccaṃ samāso. The commentary runs as follows:
"The primary derivatives that are standing near to another noun are always compounded with it". ${ }^{2}$

Though the term is missing in the rules of MV, it is used at MVu 3.10: vuttidevopapadasamāse. Besides this, the Pali grammarians have also made use of the word yoga instead of upapada. Cf. e.g., māyoge subbakāle ca (Kacc 422), matantare māyoge hiyyattan'-ajjatanī-pañcamiyo subbakāle (Sadd 891), māyoge ī ā ādi (MV 6.13).

# B. 

P has used the term upapada in its general as well as special sense. At P 1.3.71: mithyopapadāt krño'bhyāse, upapada is used in the sense of 'near a word' whereas in upapadam atin (P 2.2.19), it denotes a word in the locative in the rules of the Ast. In this sense, upapada is defined as: tatropapadaṃ saptamisstham / (P 3.1.92)
"There, the technical term upapada denotes a form ending in the seventh sup triplet."

In the expression upapadavibhakti, upapada denotes a syntactically connected individual noun and the expression upapadavibhakti means case endings governed by syntactically connected nouns.

Śarva follows P and defines upapada as: saptamyuktam upapadam / (Kt 4.2.2)

1 Kacc 79, Kacc 389; Sadd 190, Sadd 682.
2 upapade thitānaṃ dhātumayānam padānam pubbapadehi suha niccaṃ samāso hoti /
"Upapada denotes a word in the locative [in the Kt's rules]."

Later grammarians generally avoid this word of four syllables, replacing it by yoga, yukta, etc.

# C. 

The Pali grammarians have used the term upapada in a more general sense compared to P and Sarva. Besides upapada, they have also used yoga to the same effect.
# Observations 

1. The Pali Atṭhakathās are full of occasional grammatical discussions. In course of these discussions, they have used a limited grammatical terminology. Though this terminology is limited, it shows traces of an indigenous Pali grammatical terminology different from that of Sanskrit. Few of these terms have also made their entry into the Pali grammars.
2. There are 52 terms, which are common to all the three Pali grammarians. There are 50 terms, which are common only to K and Agg. There are 6 terms, which are common only to Agg and Mogg.
3. There are 36 instances where Mogg uses a different term than the other two Pali grammarians. There are 15 terms in Agg's Sadd, and 3 in Mogg's MV, which are without their corresponding terms in the other two grammars.
4. Out of 102 terms used by $\mathrm{K}, 61$ are common to Aṣt, 83 to Kt and 32 to CV.
5. Out of 127 terms used by Agg, 67 are common to Aṣt, 86 to Kt and 34 to CV.
6. Out of 100 terms used by Mogg, 45 are common to Aṣt, 46 to Kt and 56 to CV.
7. Vuddhi (Skt. vriddhi) is the only term used by the Pali grammarians, which is similar in shape but different in sense as compared to the Sanskrit grammars. In Pali, it denotes the phonemes $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$ whereas in Sanskrit, it denotes vowels $\bar{a}$, ai, au, $\bar{a} r$ and $\bar{a} l$. With regard to the term savanna (Skt. savarna), the Pali grammarians' usage of the term matches with that of Kt and not with that of P .
8. On a number of occasions, the Pali grammarians have used more than one technical term to convey the same idea, e.g.,
Mogg uses sumāsa and ekattha for a compound, Agg uses linga and pätipadika for a stem, and K uses okāsa and padesa for the adhikarana kāraka. Apart from these, sometimes they have used a single term to convey two distinct ideas, e.g., in Kacc and Sadd, the term linga is sometimes used to denote a nominal stem whereas elsewhere it is used in the sense of a grammatical gender and in MV, ägama, which is generally used for the augments, is once used to denote the conjugational affixes. On some occasions, instead of a technical term, they have made use of the idea itself for which the technical term is used, e.g., in some rules they have used the technical term ga, which stands for a vocative singular suffix whereas in another rule they have used the term älapanekavacana itself. Such an inconsistency in use of the technical terms is definitely confusing for a student.
9. There are 15 terms in Kacc that are without parallel in the three Sanskrit grammars. They are: anāga:a, asabbadhātuka, -älapana, okāsa, kälätipatti, ga, gha, jha, niggahīta, pa, paccuppanna, la, vikāra, viparita and visamyoga. However, out of these, the terms such as vikāra, viparita, asabbadhātuka and kälätipatti do occur in older works on the Sanskrit philology. The terms such as anägata, paccuppanna and älapana seem to have originated in the canonical literature. The term niggahita probably comes from a source common to the Atṭhakathās and Kacc. The remaining seven terms, which include the five monosyllabic terms, okāsa, which denotes the locative case and visamyoga appear to be K's own innovations.
10. K and Agg have defined few terms, which actually do not serve any practical purpose in their grammars.
11. The terms pubba and para (Skt. pürva and para), which are not considered as technical terms by the other grammarians, are treated as technical terms by Agg.
12. Taking hint from Kt and Kacc, Agg has formulated two special terms viz. paranayana and viyoga to denote two distinct
grammatical operations of conjoining and disjoining the syllables in the context of a sandhi.
13. Agg has included a considerable number of terms from the Pali Atṭhakathās and the other traditional sources. These basically include the phonetic terminology such as sithila, dhanita, aphuttha and phuttha etc., the case terminology such as paccattavacana and upayogavacana etc. and the term denoting an adverb viz., bhāvanapumsaka.
14. As many as 71 terms from P's Ast, which are also common to Kt with the sole exception of ekasesa, have got their way into the Pali grammars. Out of these,
a. There are 38 terms, which have their parallels in all the three Pali grammars. (See table 1).
b. There are 23 terms, which have their parallels only in Kacc, and Sadd. (See table 2).
c. There are three terms, which have their parallel only in Sadd and MV such as adhikaraṇa, kāraka and laghu / lahu.
d. There are three terms, which are only found in Sadd, viz. payatana / prayatna, vacana, and prātipadika / pātipadika.
e. There are four terms, which are only found in MV, viz. bhūta, parokṣabhūta / parokkhabhūta, vartamāna / vattamāna, anadyatanabhūta / anajjatanabhūta.
15. There are 86 terms in Kt , which have their parallels in the Pali grammars. Out of these,
a. There are 44 terms, which have their parallel in all the three Pali grammars. (See table 3).
b. There are 39 terms, which have their parallel only in Kacc and Sadd. (See table 4).
c. There are two terms, vikarana and laghu, which have their parallels only in Sadd and MV.
d. The term sandhi is only found in Sadd.
16. There are 68 terms of CV, which have their parallel in the Pali grammars. Out of these
a. 30 terms have their parallel in all the three Pali grammars. (See table 5).
b. There are only two terms, which are common only to Kacc and Sadd. They are ekavacana and bahuvacana.
c. Two terms kāraka and laghu have their parallel only in Sadd and MV.
d. 24 terms have their parallels only in MV. (See table 6).

# Conclusions 

1. The Pali Aṭthakathās of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta and Dhammapāla show the existence of a limited indigenous Pali grammatical terminology different from that of Sanskrit.
2. Near-about $80 \%$ of technical terms used by the Pali grammarians are taken over from the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. K's grammar actually presupposes the knowledge of the Sanskrit grammatical terminology. However, there are a few terms, which are taken over from the Aṭthakathās as well as from the canonical and the non-canonical literature.
3. K's original contribution to the grammatical terminology is restricted to the five monosyllabic arbitrary terms such as jha, la, pa, gha and ga and the terms denoting the locative viz. okāsa, and simplification viz. visaṃyoga. Agg and Mogg, however, have not made any new contribution in this field.
4. The fact that unlike some of the Sanskrit grammars such as Harināmāmrta, the Pali grammarians did not use any such term, which is so to say related to their philosophy, shows the secular character of their grammatical terminology.

# Chapter Three 

## Comparative Analysis of the Technique of the Pali and the Sanskrit Grammarians

Aim and Nature

As is proposed in the first chapter, the emergence of an indigenous Pali grammar was probably prompted by a need to prepare a textbook for the monastic community to teach the broad features of Pali in the simplest possible way. Sarva's Kt was the best model of such a type of grammar before the compilers of the Kacc. Thus, the Kacc was composed in such a way as would meet the requirements of its students. The rules were arranged according to their topics. A section dealing with sandhi is given at the beginning. The technical terms used in a particular chapter are generally given at its beginning. Each section is composed in such a way as would form an independent unit. Thus, if students are interested in learning only a particular section such as nominal inflection or compounds or verbal inflection, they do not have to go through the complete text as in the case of the students of the Ast or the CV. Later grammarians such as Agg and Mogg have also followed the same pattern in their treatises. Thus, the nature of the Pali grammars is more like a guiding manual.

The basic aim of the Ast is to recapitulate essentials of the Sanskrit grammar and to present them in the most succinct form in order to facilitate memorization rather than to teach Sanskrit grammar in a simple, easy manner. The rules of the Ast are interdependent in such a way that any rule of the Ast presupposes knowledge of the rest of the Ast. This interdependence of the sütras in the Ast makes impossible a gradual understanding of the Ast. Thus, the form of the Ast is not that of a students' textbook on the Sanskrit grammar but that of a highly sophisticated digest
meant for those alone who are proficient not only in Sanskrit language but also in its grammar.

# Arrangement 

The Pali grammarians have followed the traditional topic-wise arrangement of the rules as used in the Kt. All the three grammars begin with a list of alphabets followed by a section on the technical terms and the operational rules. The rest of their grammar can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with the nominal derivatives whereas the second part deals with the verbal derivatives. The sequence of topics followed in the Kacc and the Sadd is exactly identical with that of the Kt. ${ }^{1}$

Although Mogg has accepted the basic structure of the Kacc, he has introduced some changes in the sequence of some subtopics. In his grammar, sections dealing with kārakas and vibhattis are shifted before the section on the nominal inflection. This appears to be a more logical arrangement. The section on primary derivatives is shifted before the verbal inflection. It seems that the change in the sequence of the section dealing with the primary derivatives and the one dealing with the verbal derivatives is prompted by the arrangement of the Aṣt and the CV. ${ }^{2}$ Thus, the Pali grammarians have arranged their texts according to the various grammatical categories such as compounds, primary derivatives, secondary derivatives etc.

As is said before, grammars of P and C are governed by the two main principles of anuvrtti and vipratisedha. These grammarians have also followed the topic-wise arrangement wherever it does not violate these two principles. Modern scholars have classified these grammars into two main sections viz. analytical and synthetic. The analytical part, which forms the core

[^0]:    1 Refer the schemes of these grammars given in the first chapter.
    2 For details, cp. the schemes of these grammars.
of these grammars, analyses the language into some basic elements such as morphemes. In the synthetic part, there are rules, which are helpful in deriving words from morphemes and sentences from words. Thus, P and C have laid more emphasis on the derivational procedure.

# The Manner of Description: General and Particular Rules 

It is quite well known that P has adopted the technique of generalization and particularization to compose his grammar. He developed it to such perfection that he could describe a large number of linguistic facts in the shortest possible manner. Cf. kiñcit sāmānyaviśesaval laksanam pravartyamin yenālpena yatnena mahato mahatah śabdaughān pratipadyeran (Mbh I.6). This most scientific method of the language description was later adopted by all the systems of grammar.

The Pali grammarians have also described all the grammatical phenomena in terms of generalization and particularization. Cp. e.g., vā nappacce (Kacc 346) and nāyana-nāna vacchādito (Kacc 347). Out of these, vā napacce is a general rule. It teaches: "the suffix $n a$ is to be added after any noun in the sense of 'an offspring'". Kacc 347 is a particular rule. It teaches: "the suffixes $n \bar{a} y a n a$ and $n \bar{a} n a$ are to be added after the words from the class of nouns beginning with vaccha".

There is no doubt that the Pali grammarians have borrowed this scheme of general (utsarga) and particular (apavāda) rules from their Sanskrit counterparts. However, it should be mentioned that while describing compounds and syntactic relations, they have formulated rules describing the general facts rather than the particular cases. On the other hand, while describing the morphophonemic changes, K and Agg have formulated separate rules for individual cases even when generalizations were possible, e.g., the morphophonemic changes taught in rules Kacc 579-581 were explained by Mogg using one general rule viz. MV 5.95.
Thus, although the Pali grammarians have followed the same manner of description, by way of general and particular rules, their level of generalizations is not as high as that of P .

# The Sūtra Style 

The sūtra style of composition represents a genre belonging to the ancient Indian literature. A sūtra is a short but precise statement capable of expressing the complete meaning in a condensed form.

A Pāṇinian sūtra is regarded as a perfect model of the sūtra type of composition. Brevity leading to the most condensed formation is the soul of P's sūtra style. Secondly, as already stated by Faddegon, P's grammar, like other sūtra works, is composed for scholars and teachers thoroughly acquainted with the subject and not for students who do not know anything. Lastly, the sūtras being basically meant for memorization, they are given as a continuous text (saṃhitāpāṭha).

The Pali grammarians have also adopted the sūtra style of composition in their grammars. L. N. Tiwari (1962: 443-451) has shown that around 215 rules of the Kt and around 300 of the Ast (including the overlap with the Kt ) are reproduced in the Kacc with necessary alterations. Still, there are more than half of the Kacc's rules that are without parallel in Sanskrit and therefore, can be treated as original ones. Here it should be noted that although a number of rules from the Kacc correspond to the rules of the Ast, it generally follows the descriptive style of the Kt .

Like the Kt , many of the rules of the Kacc are not composed in a compressed sūtra style of P . At the same time, K has not followed the kārikā style of composition found in the samāsa and the taddhita section of the Kt. Cp.:
syātām yadi pade dve tu yadi vā syur bahūny api /
tāny anyasya padasyārthe bahuvrīhih //(Kt 2.5.9).
aññapadatthesu bahubbīhi (Kacc 330).
vibhaktisamjinā vijñeyā vakṣyante'tah paraṃ tu ye... (Kt 2.6.24).
tvādayo vibhattisaññāyo (Kacc 249).
Agg's Sadd, which is basically modeled on the Kacc and the Kacc-Vu, is more elaborate and prolific. In the Sadd, we come across two types of rules viz. the rules that are composed in a sūtra style and the rules that are composed in the commentarial style using the sentence format. Cp. e.g., yam ivanṇo na vā "the phoneme $i$ rarely transforms into $y$ before a vowel" (Sadd 51), and kvaci sare vyañjane vā odantānaṃ nāmānam akārantattam pakati (Sadd 163).

In the matter of rule formation, Mogg follows the pattern of P and C's grammars. Many of C's rules are even reproduced verbatim by Mogg. However, the influence of the Kacc and the Kt on the sections dealing with the technical terms, sandhi, and nominal inflections is beyond doubt. Although Mogg has not made use of the pratyāhāras, he has used other technical devices of P and C such as use of the indicatory letters, etc. He has also adopted the Pāninian technique of compressing more than one statement into a single rule with a greater efficiency than K and Agg, e.g., tavaggavaraṇānaṃ ye cavaggabayaña (MV 1.48).

In the Kacc, words are arranged in such a way that there would not be any possibility for such a sandhi, which could make the meaning ambiguous. Agg has a tendency of making the statements still clearer by supplying additional expressions. Mogg on the other hand, composes rules in such a way that would lead to more condensed expressions. This can be well illustrated by a rule from each of these grammars teaching the technical term gha for all the feminine nouns ending in the phoneme $\bar{a}: \bar{a}$ gho (Kacc 60), ākāro gho (Sadd 207), and gha (MV 1.11). Thus, the clarity of expression is the soul of K and Agg's sūtra style. On the other hand, Mogg has given an equal importance to brevity as well as clarity.
To sum up, it can be said that on account of following the more traditional unsophisticated way of the sūtra formation, the suttas of the Pali grammarians have not become as compressed as P's. Consequently, they are simpler and less cryptic than those of P .

# Rule Formations 

As any other sūtra of grammar, the suttas of the Pali grammar are constituted by a subject, a predicate and a condition in the form of a preceding or a following item or a reference to meaning. Each rule is a sentence with a single clause. The basic format of such rules is ' X is Y in the environment Z ', e.g., harassa (Subject) gim (predicate) se (environment) "gim is substituted in the place of the latter form of the duplicated root hara before the suffix sa" (Kacc 476). The general method followed by K and Agg in the formulation of grammatical rules is that the morphophonemic changes are taught by means of an accusative and the general formulae of such rules is 'X-nom. is substituted by Y-acc'. Cf. for example, ivanṇo yanna vā "the phoneme $i$ rarely transforms into $y$ before a vowel" (Kacc 21), sarā sare lopam "a vowel is elided before a vowel" (Kacc 12); yam ivanṇo na vā "the phoneme $i$ rarely transforms into $y$ before a vowel" (Sadd 51), and sarā lopam papponti sare "vowels are elided before vowels" (Sadd 30). In case of other rules of substitution, these formulas are changed to ' X gen. is substituted by Y-nom'. Cf. for instance: kvaci pati patissa "Sometimes pati is substituted by pati before a vowel or a consonant" (Kacc 48), kvaci sare vyañjane vā pati patissa "Sometimes pati is substituted by pati before a vowel or a consonant" (Sadd 137), ghapato ca yonam lopo "The suffix yo of the nominative and the accusative is elided after nominal stems denoted by gha, pa, jha and la" (Kacc 118), ghapato ca yonam lutti "The elision of the suffix yo of the nominative and the accusative takes place after nominal stems denoted by gha, pa, jha and la" (Sadd 293). It seems that this dual format was adopted from the Kt. Cp.: ivanṇo yam asavarne na ca paro lopyah "The phoneme $i$ is substituted by $y$ - before a non-homophonous phoneme and the
following phoneme is not to be elided" (Kt 1.2.8), vam uvarnah "The phoneme $u$ is substituted by $v$ - before a non-homophonous phoneme and the following phoneme is not to be elided" etc. ( Kt 1.2.9) ('X-nom. is replaced by Y-acc.'); hrasvo'mbārthānām "The final phoneme of the nominal stems meaning 'the mother' and those designated as śraddh $\bar{a}$ is elided before the vocative singular suffix (sambuddhi)" (Kt 2.1.40), kates ca jassasor luk "The suffixes jas and śas are elided after the numeral kati and those ending in sa and na" ('X-Gen. is replaced by Y-Nom.') (Kt 2.1.76). However, in some cases, such changes are taught even by juxtaposing the two elements, e.g. thā tiṭtho "The verbal root th $\bar{a}$ is optionally substituted by tiṭtha" (Kacc 470). In a few cases, the substituend and the substituendum are simply juxtaposed in the nominative, e.g., abbho abhi" abhi is substituted by abbh before a vowel" (Kacc 44).

In the MV, we come across two tendencies in the formulation of rules. As in the Aṣt and the CV, the substitution of an entire item or its final element is taught by means of a genitive. The formula of such rules is 'X-gen. is substituted by Y-nom.', e.g., yuvannāname o luttā "After an elided vowel, the phonemes $i$ and $u$ are optionally substituted by $e$ and $o$ respectively" (MV 1.29), and yo nam ni "After a nominal stem ending in the phoneme $a$, the suffix yo of the nominative and the accusative is substituted by $n i$ in the case of a neuter gender" (MV 2.114). However, in the first chapter, there are four rules where this formula has been changed to 'X-nom. is substituted by Y-nom.'. Cp. for instance: saro lopo sare sare "a vowel is to be elided before a vowel" (MV 1.26), paro kvaci "A vowel is sometimes elided after a vowel" (MV 1.27) and na dve $v \bar{a}$ "Sometimes both preceding and following vowels are not elided" (MV 1.28). Note that lopo is continued in 1.27 and 1.28 by ellipsis. MVu explains these rules by resorting to the passive construction. Cp. for instance: sare saro lopanīyo hoti (MVu 1.26), saramhā paro saro kvaci lopanīyo hoti (MVu 1.27) and pubbaparasarā dvepi vā kvaci na lupyante (MVu 1.28). lopo "Sometimes, the nasal is elided" (MV 1.39) teaches elision of a niggahīta. Niggahītam (nt. nom. sg.) is continued in this rule by
ellipsis. MVu, however, explains this rule by transforming niggahītam into niggahītassa (gen. sg.): niggahītassa Iopo hoti vā kvaci.

Like most of the rules of the Ast, each rule of the Pali grammarians is a simple sentence containing one statement, e.g. harassa gim se "gim is substituted in the place of the latter form of the duplicated root hara before the suffix sa" (Kacc 476); sadassa sīdo "Sometimes, the verbal root sada is substituted by sīda" (Sadd 1213) and hanassa ghäto nānubandhe "hana is substiuted by ghäta before the suffix having an indicatory letter na" (MV 5.99). However, occasionally, as P does, many statements are compressed into one statement when the items contained in the statements are of a homogeneous nature, e.g., mahadabhehi mmayhajjabbhaddhā ca "After the verbal roots ending in ma, ha, $d a$ and $b h a$, the initial phoneme of the suffixes tūna etc. is optionally substituted by $m m a$, yha, jja, bbha and ddha and the final phoneme of the verbal root is elided" (Kacc 602), ma-ha-da-bhehi mma-yha-jja-bbha-ddhā ca "After the verbal roots ending in $m a, h a, d a$ and $b h a$, the initial phoneme of the suffixes tūna etc. is optionally substituted by $m m a$, yha, jja, bbha and ddha and the final phoneme of the verbal root is elided" (Sadd 1205), tavaggavaranānan̉ ye cavaggabayan̄a "The phonemes of the $t$ class, $v, r$ and $n$ are substituted respectively by the phonemes of the $c$ - class, $b, y$ and $\bar{n}$ before the phoneme $y^{\prime \prime}$ (MV 1.48). Cp. iko yan aci (P 6.1.77), which contains four statements: ' $i$ becomes $y$ ' etc. In this rule, four statements are compressed into one single statement. The number of compressed statements used by K and Agg is, however, smaller than those used by Mogg. Thus, some phonetic changes, which are taught by K and Agg in a number of rules, are put together by Mogg in one or two rules in a more compressed form, for instance, the changes taught by Kacc 19, 44, 45, 271, 443, 445, etc., Sadd 46, 104-110 are taught by MV 1.48, 1.49. On two occasions, Mogg has divided a single rule of the Kacc into two in order to indicate a special status of the concerned item, e.g., K's rule sabbato nvutvävī vā (Kacc 529), which teaches three suffixes, $n v u, t u$ and $\bar{a} v \bar{\imath}$, in the sense of an agent, is divided
by Mogg in two rules: kattari Itunakā (MV 5.33) and $\bar{a} v \bar{\imath}$ (MV 5.34). Mogg's intention behind this division is to indicate the limited scope of the suffix $\bar{a} v \bar{\imath}$ as compared to the other two. ${ }^{1}$

# Nominal Style 

The suttas of the Pali grammars are mostly composed in the nominal style. In this type of composition, the helping verb is either missing or is to be supplied from outside, e.g., saro lopo sare sare "a vowel is to be elided before a vowel" (MV 1.26). In this case, Mogg has used a nominal form lopo instead of lupyate. The corresponding rule of the Kacc is sarā sare lopam "a vowel is elided before a vowel" (Kacc 12). Here, one has to supply a helping verb papponti to get a complete sentence:
sarā kho sabbe pi sare pare lopam pappont? (Kacc-Vu 12).
Among the Pali grammarians, Mogg is a meticulous follower of this style with the sole exception of MV 4.120: dissataññepi paccay $\bar{a} .{ }^{3} \mathrm{~K}$ and Agg have, however, made occasional use of a finite verbal form ${ }^{4}$ e.g., viyojaye, naye, sijihanti, thapeyya, papponti, nipaccate, etc. Such grammatical aphorisms are more like a statement than a traditional sutta.

The nominal style is the prominent feature of P's rules. The only finite verb found in P's metalanguage is drs̆yate / drs̆yante. C has followed P in this respect. Though Sarva also follows the nominal style in rule formations, on a number of occasions, his rules appear like sentences as they involve some helping verb, e.g., sadyaādyā nipātyante (Kt 2.6.37), idamkimbhyāṃ thamuh kāryah (Kt 2.6.39) etc.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 appavisayatāñāpanattham bhinnayogakaranam (MVu 5.34).
    2 "All vowels preceding another vowel attain elision".
    3 "A vowel preceding another vowel is elided".
    4 Cf. e.g., Kacc 10, 11, 393; Sadd 28-30, 830, 849 etc.
To sum up, although the Pali grammarians have generally followed the nominal style in the formulation of rules, K and Agg have used more number of verbal forms than Mogg. Thus, in this regard, their style is more like Sarva than that of P .

# Meta-language 

The metalinguistic use of an ablative, a genitive and a locative, which originated in P's grammar, is retained in the Pali grammars. Here too, the genitive indicates the actual place for the grammatical operation, e.g., harassa gim se "gim is substituted in the place of the latter form of the duplicated root hara before the suffix sa" (Kacc 476), jiharānam gim "gim is substituted in the place of the latter form of the duplicated roots $j i$ and hara (before the suffix sa)" (MV 5.102). Note that sometimes the nominative also performs the same function in the Kacc and the Sadd, e.g., ivanno yam na vā "the phoneme $i$ rarely transforms into $y$ before a vowel" (Kacc 21). A locative denotes operations applying to what precedes, e.g., sarā sare lopam "a vowel is elided before a vowel" (Kacc 12), sarā lopam papponti sare "vowels are elided before vowels" (Sadd 30), saro lopo sare "a vowel is to be elided before a vowel" (MV 1.26) and an ablative denotes operations that apply to what follows, e.g., karato ririyo "an affix ririya is introduced after the verbal root kar" (Kacc 556), karā ririyo "the suffix ririya is added after the verbal root kar" (MV 5.51). Apart from this, a locative is also used to express the meaning condition of a particular grammatical operation, e.g. vā nappacce "the suffix $n a$ is optionally added to a noun in the sense of 'his or her offspring'" (Kacc 346), no vāpacce "the suffix $n a$ is optionally added to a noun in the sense of 'his or her offspring'" (MV 4.1). In this connection, it should be noted that in the Ast's taddhita section, the meaning items are often given in a nominative, but in rules such as tasya pūraṇe dat (P 5.2.48), it is mentioned in a locative. The Pali grammarians have also followed a similar trend in this regard.
The Pāninian practice of mentioning the syntactically adjacent word (upapada) in a locative is also followed by K and Agg, e.g. dhā̄uyā kammādimhi no "an affix na is introduced after a verbal root co-occurring with a noun denoting a direct obejct" (Kacc 526); kammādimhi dhātuto no "an affix na is introduced after a verbal root co-occurring with a noun denoting a direct object" (Sadd 1106). Cp. karmany an (P 3.2.1). However, this practice is not consistently followed by them, as in īsadussūhi kha bhāvakammesu "an affix kha is introduced after any verbal root occurring after the words isa, $d u$ or $s u$ in the sense of an impersonal action or any syntactic relation known as kāraka" (Kacc 562) and isa-du-suto kho bhāvakammesu "an affix kha is introduced after any verbal root occurring after the words isa, $d u$ or $s u$ in the sense of an impersonal action or any syntactic relation known as kāraka" (Sadd 1147), an upapada is mentioned in an ablative. Cp.: īṣad-dusṣu kṛcchrākṛcchārtheṣu khal (P 3.3.126). In Mogg's grammar, an upapada is not mentioned with a locative. It is simply treated as any other preceding word and is thus mentioned in the ablative, e.g. kamm $\bar{a}$ "an affix $k u$ is introduced after the verbal root $t \bar{a}$ occurring after a noun denoting a direct object" (MV 5.40). Mogg here seems to follow C who also mentions the upapada in an ablative. Cf. vyāpyād an (CV 1.2.1). ${ }^{1}$ Here it should be noted that sometimes the Pali grammarians have used the word yoge "in association with" to indicate an upapada. Cf. māyoge sabbakāle ca "the verbal case terminations of simple past or aorist are introduced after a verbal root denoting an action belonging to any tense when there is a syntactic association with the preventive particle $m \bar{a}$ " (Kacc 422); māyogaṭthāne tā pāyena ca "the verbal case terminations of simple past or aorist are usually introduced after a verbal root denoting an action belonging to any tense when there is a syntactic association with the preventive particle $m \bar{a}$ " (Sadd 888); māyoge $\bar{\imath} \bar{a} \bar{a} d \bar{d}$ "the verbal case

[^0]
[^0]:    1 This is C's rule for P's karmany an.
terminations $I$ etc. or $\bar{a}$ etc. of simple past or aorist are introduced after a verbal root when there is a syntactic association with the preventive particle $m \bar{a}$ " (MV 6.13). Cp. māni luñ "(The $I$ substitutes of) luñ (Aorist) are introduced [after a verbal stem] cooccurring with the preventive particle mān" (P 3.3.175). The Pali grammarians' usage of the instrumental is rather conventional than technical. It is generally used in its ordinary sense of 'with', e.g., dhātunāmānamupasaggayogādisvapi ca "When there is a syntactic relation with a verbal root or a noun as well as with the prefix etc. that kāraka is called apādāna" (Kacc 274), vajjanatthāpapariyoge "When there is a syntactic relation with apa and pari, conveying the sense of avoiding that kāraka is called apādāna" (Sadd 560), apaparīhi vajjane "The ablative case terminations are introduced after a noun when it is syntactically related with apa and pari conveying the sense of avoiding" (MV 2.29), anunā "the accusative case terminations are introduced after a nominal stem when there is a syntactic association with a particle anu indicating 'characteristic', 'statement of fact', 'division' and 'distributive function'" (MV 2.12).

Although K and Agg follow the meta-linguistic usage of the cases, they have not formulated rules specifying the function of each of these cases. Mogg on the other hand has explained it in rules: sattamiyam pubbassa "a grammatical operation taught with the word in locative applies to what precedes" (MV 1.14), ${ }^{1}$ pañcamiyam parassa "a grammatical operation taught with the word in ablative applies to what follows" (MV 1.15) ${ }^{2}$ and chatthiyantassa "a grammatical operation taught with the word in genitive applies to its final phoneme" (MV 1.17). ${ }^{3}$ Mogg is very consistent in the use of these cases. K and Agg on the other hand are not so meticulous in this regard.

1 Cp. P 1.1.66, CV 1.1.7.
2 Cp. P 1.1.67, CV 1.1.8.
3 Cp. P 1.1.49, CV 1.1.10.
# Other Technical Devices 

The main aim of any good grammar should be to explain in the most precise and brief manner as many linguistic facts as possible about that particular language. In order to achieve this goal, the grammarians have adopted several technical devices such as the use of the principle of ellipsis, section headings, use of indicatory letters etc. Some of the important technical devices adopted by the Pali grammarians are studied in the following section from a comparative point of view.

## Ellipsis

The principle of ellipsis is the common feature of both the ordinary as well as the scientific language. Its functioning consists in the completion of an incomplete sentence with the help of relevant words borrowed from the earlier context.

The principle of ellipsis is the most prominent feature of the Pāṇinian sūtra style. Even though some other sūtra works also follow the principle of ellipsis, the most methodical and accurate implementation of the conventions of ellipsis is found for the first time in the Aṣt.

The Pali grammarians have followed the principle of ellipsis within each section of their grammar as in the Aṣt. However, the precision and accuracy with which it is used in P's Ast, is lacking in the Kacc. Though Agg has tried to remove some of these lapses by supplying additional words, still there are a number of occasions where the principle of ellipsis is violated. In such cases, it is difficult to understand the exact meaning of a particular rule without the help of the commentary. For instance, sarā pakati byañjane (Kacc 23) teaches a non-sandhi in the case of a vowel followed by a consonant. In the next rule sare kvaci, which teaches the non-sandhi of a vowel followed by another vowel, the word byañjane is discontinued by the word sare. However, in dīgham
(Kacc 25), which teaches the lengthening of a vowel in front of a consonant, instead of continuing the word sare, the word byañjane is continued from Kacc 23. Agg improves upon Kacc 25 by adding the word byañjane. The parallel rule is Sadd reads: sarā byañjane dîgham. In the matter of using the principle of ellipsis, Mogg is more accurate than the other two Pali grammarians.

# Section Headings (Adhikāra) 

There has been a convention in Sanskrit grammar to give section headings at the beginning of each section. The section heading is traditionally known as an adhikāra. It sets forth the main topic of that section. It also serves as a separating line between the two sections. In this connection, it should be noted that the text of the Aṣt was originally handed down in a form of a continuous text and in such cases it was difficult to separate one topic from the other. Besides, adhikāra is an effective means of economy. It avoids repetition as the context denoted by it is automatically continued in all the subsequent rules of that section.

Just as the Sanskrit grammarians, the Pali grammarians have made use of the governing rules (adhikārasuttas) as section headings. Cf. e.g., Kacc 521, 53, 56, 415; Sadd 253, 309, 849; MV $1.58,5.14,5.106$. In the MV, the scope of most of these rules is defined in the commentary. Cf. ayamadhikāro yāva sāsassa sisve (5.117) ti (MVu 5.106).

In Pali grammars, the number of such heading rules is smaller compared to that of the Aṣt. Some of the section headings of the Aṣt, such as samhitäyām etc. are totally discarded by the Pali grammarians. Some of the other section headings such as pratyayah, paraś ca, ńyāp prātipadikāt, dhātoh etc. are incorporated by them into the main body of rules, e.g. dhātulirigehi

[^0]
[^0]:    1 According to Kacc-Vn 52, this is a governing rule having a lion's gait: sihagatikādhikāro'yam.
parāppaccayā (Kacc 434), dhātulingānukaraṇehi paccayā (Sadd 905). In Pali grammars, the section headings are not marked with any indicatory sign. Thus, one has to depend on the commentary to know whether a particular rule is a section heading or not.

P has used around 55 section headings throughout the Aṣt. The scope of some of these section headings is mentioned by him in the actual text ${ }^{1}$ whereas in case of some other rules, it is delimited by the subsequent section headings. ${ }^{2}$ However, in case of the remaining rules, it is decided by the commentators. ${ }^{3}$

In P's grammar, a section heading is marked by a svarita accent. ${ }^{4}$ This device of marking a section heading is, however, not used by the later grammarians like Sarva and C.

# Technical Terminology 

The type of technical terminology used by the Pali grammarians can be classified as self-explanatory and artificial or indigenous and borrowed. For instance, the terms such as sabbanäma, paccaya, etc. are self-explanatory whereas terms such as jha, la etc. are artificial. Terms such as niggahīta, sithila etc. are indigenous whereas the terms such as ghosa, aghosa are borrowed.

1 Cf. e.g., prāk kad̄ārāt samāsah (P 2.1.3). "(The technical term) samāsa 'compound' denotes (all items resulting from the application of subsequent rules in this section) prior to (the sūtra: kad̄ārāh karmadhāraye 2.2.38)".
2 avyayībhāvah "(The technical term avyayībhāva (compound) denotes all items derived by the application of subsequent rules (up to 21) (P 2.1.5).
tatpuruṣah "(The technical term) tatpuruṣa (compound) (denotes compounds formed by subsequent rules in the section beginning here and ending with 2.2.23)" (P 2.1.22).

3 pratyayah (P 3.1.1). Cf. āpañcamādhyāyaparisamāpter yān ita ūrdhvam anukramiṣyāmah pratyayasaṁjnās te veditavyāh (Kāśikā 3.1.1).
4 svaritenādhikārah (P 1.3.11) : "Elements which are to serve as governing rules or section headings valid in the subsequent rules are marked with the svarita accent".
Apart from this, there are technical terms which are sample terms representing their own class such as tappurisa, bahubbīhi etc. The method of using such sample terms is very old. Many such terms can be found in the grammars of P and Sarva.

The Pali grammarians seem to be more in favour of those technical terms, which are well established and self-explanatory. Thus, they have used more familiar technical terms such as akkhara, sara, vyañjana etc. instead of their abbreviations such as al, ac and hal respectively as used by P and C . The use of the five artificial, monosyllabic technical terms to denote four inflectional classes of nominals and the vocative singular is, however, an exception. These terms have no parallel in any Sanskrit grammar. Similarly, other terms such as sithila, dhanita, sambaddha, vavatthita, niggahīta, etc., which are taken over from the Atṭhakathā literature, have no parallel in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. Out of these, the terms sithila, dhanita, sambaddha, vavatthita, which are introduced and defined in the Sadd, serve no real purpose, as they are never employed in that grammar. The Pali grammarians have discarded some of the technical terms used in the Kt and the Aṣt such as gati, antahstha, anunāsika, either by subsuming them under wider categories or by representing the concept by means of some other devices. For instance, Mogg describes the gati compounds at MV 3.14-16 without actually using the term. The anunāsikas (nasals) are referred to as vaggantas, e.g. vaggantam vā vagge (Kacc 31); vagge vagganto (MV 1.41).

The technical terminology of K and Agg is influenced by the Kt. Following C, Mogg generally avoids the use of technical terms. Instead of using a technical term to denote a particular idea, he clearly mentions to the ideas themselves, e.g., dvitte pubba for abbhāsa and antassarādi for the Pāninian $t \bar{t}$.

The main core of the technical terminology of the Pali grammarians is borrowed from their Sanskrit predecessors. Their innovation in this field is restricted to the creation of some
artificial monosyllabic terms to denote different classes of nominals and the vocative singular and introducing a limited Atṭhakathā terminology.

# Rules of Interpretation 

The operational rules or rules of interpretation provide a decoding mechanism for a grammatical text. Some of these rules give guidelines with regard to the meta-linguistic usage of a particular case. For example, P's rule ṣaṣthī sthāneyogā (P 1.4.49) tells us that the genitive in P's grammar is to be interpreted as 'in the place of'. Among the Pali grammarians, only Mogg has provided such a decoding mechanism in his grammar. Cf. MV $1.14-15,17$. Though the cases like the ablative, the genitive and the locative perform a similar function in the Kacc and the Sadd, K and Agg have not laid down any rules regarding their interpretation. Due to the absence of such rules, sometimes K and Agg are forced to make explicit statements in place of a codified rule. This can be well illustrated with the help of the following rules teaching the substitution of da of dasa by ra after a numeral: ekādito dasassa ra samikhyāne "In the case of numerals, da of dasa is optionally substituted by ra" (Kacc 383), ekādīhi vā dasassa dassa ro samikhyāne "In the case of numerals, da of dasa is optionally substituted by ra after eka etc." (Sadd 812) and ra samikhyāto vā "After a numeral, the initial phoneme of dasa is optionally substituted by ra" (MV 3.103).

There are other operational rules, which specify the place of a particular grammatical element such as augments and substitutes. Just as P and C, Mogg has used indicatory letters for this purpose. For example, in Mogg's grammar, an augment with an indicatory letter $\bar{n}$ is placed before ${ }^{1}$ and the one with an indicatory letter $k$ is placed after a particular linguistic item to which it is prescribed.

[^0]
[^0]:    1 Note that P and C have used the indicatory letter $t$ for the same purpose. Cf. P 1.1.46: ādyantau takitau, CV 1.1.13: takitāv ādyantau.
Cf. ñakānubandhādyantā (MV 1.20). Similarly, a substitute with an indicatory letter $\dot{n}$ only replaces the final syllable whereas a substitute with an indicatory letter $t$ replaces the substituendum entirely. ${ }^{1}$ Cf. nanubandho, tanubandhā-nekavannā sabbassa (MV $1.18-19)$.

K and Agg have not made any provision for indicating the exact place of an augment. The general practice in this regard is that an augment is to be placed before an item mentioned in the locative and after the one mentioned in the ablative. Only in a few cases, the exact place of an augment is mentioned explicitly in the rule, e.g., rudhādito niggahītapubbañca "An affix $a$ is introduced after a class of verbal roots rudha etc. and a nasal is augmented before its final phoneme in front of the active verbal terminations" (Kacc 448), rudhādito ca, majjhe niggahītam "An affix $a$ is introduced after a class of verbal roots rudha etc. and a nasal is augmented within the root in front of the active verbal terminations" (Sadd 926). In rest of the cases, one has to depend solely on the commentarial explanation or the knowledge of an existing usage.

Similarly, K and Agg have not used any technical device like indicatory letters to indicate a place of the substitute. In the Kacc and the Sadd, the word sabba is used to indicate that the substituendum is entirely replaced whereas the word anta is used to show that only the final syllable of a substituendum is replaced. Cf. e.g. sabbo cantī "The form $t i$ is entirely substituted by $c a$ before a vowel" (Kacc 19); and ntussanto yosu ca "The final phoneme of the affix $n t u$ is substituted by $a$ before the case terminations $s u, h i$, nam, or yo" (Kacc 92). However, this usage has not been followed consistently. There are a large number of rules that are without these indicatory words e.g. ntussa nto "An affix ntu along with the

[^0]
[^0]:    1 P and C have used the indicator letter s for the same purpose. Cf. P 1.1.55: anekāls̄it sarvasya, CV 1.1.12: śid anekāl sarvasya.
    2 sabbādesattham sabbaggahanam katam (Kacc-Vṇ 19).
case termination is substituted by nto before a nominative case termination yo" (Kacc 122) and pañcādinamattam "The numerals pañca are substituted by $a$ before the case terminations su, nam or $h i^{\prime \prime}$ (Kacc 90). ${ }^{1}$ Therefore, in such cases, one has to depend solely on the commentators for their interpretation.

There are other types of operational rules, which provide guidelines for interpreting a grammatical text, e.g. vidhibbisesanantassa (MV 1.13), which is equivalent to the rule yena vidhis tadantasya (P 1.1.72). According to this rule, "when a grammatical operation is stated with reference to a qualifying item, then such an operation applies to a linguistic element ending in it", e.g. ato yonam $t \bar{a} t e$ "After a nominal stem ending in the phoneme $a$ case terminations $y o$ (of the nominative and the accusative) are substituted by $t \bar{a}$ and $t e$ respectively" (MV 2.43). Here the substitution of a nominative and an accusative plural suffix $y o$ by $\bar{a}$ and $e$, which is taught with reference to the phoneme $a$ actually applies to a noun ending in that phoneme. Although the same principle is also applicable in the grammars of K and Agg, it has not been stated by them, e.g. ato nena "After a nominal stem ending in the phoneme $a$ the suffix $n \bar{a}$ is substituted by ena" (Kacc 103), ato näy ena "After a nominal stem ending in the phoneme $a$ the suffix $n \bar{a}$ is substituted by ena" (Sadd 271).

Although the device of ordered correspondence between two sets of equal linguistic items is used by the Pali grammarians, they have not stated this maxim of interpreting the rules like $\mathrm{P},{ }^{2}$ e.g. vagge ghosāghosānam tatiyapaṭhamā "Voiced and unvoiced consonants of the class are duplicated and substituted by the third and the first consonant of the same class after a vowel" (Kacc 29), vagge ghosāghosānaṃ savagge tatiyapaṭhamā "Voiced and

[^0]
[^0]:    1 In the first example, the substituendum is replaced entirely whereas in the second example, the final syllable alone is substituted.
    2 P 1.3.10: yathāsaṃkhyam anudeśaḥ samānām.
unvoiced consonants of the class are duplicated and substituted by the third and the first consonant of the same class after a vowel" (Sadd 68); catutthadutiyesvesam tatiyapathamā "The fourth and the second consonants of the class are substituted by the third and the first consonant of the same class before the same consonants" (MV 1.35).

# Indicatory Letters (Anubandhas) 

Anubandha is a symbolic letter added to any linguistic element. Although it does not form a part of the actual language, it serves as an indication or a sign in the grammatical text. It is an effective means of economy, as it enables a grammarian to give necessary indications with the help of a single letter, e.g., in the Pali grammars, the anubandha $\underline{n} a$ when added to a suffix indicates that phonemes $a, i$ and $u$ of the concerned stem are to be substituted by the phonemes $\bar{a}, e$ and $o$ respectively. The said change is designated as vuddhi in these grammars.

K and Agg have used only five anubandhas: $\underline{n} a$ is the indicator of a vuddhi, ra causes the dropping of a stem final, the vowels $a, i$ and $u$ are used for easy pronunciation. Out of these, the functions of the anubandhas $\underline{n} a$ and $r a$ are specified in the actual text, ${ }^{1}$ whereas there is no word of information with regard to the other

[^0]
[^0]:    1 ramhiranto rädi no "All the final phonemes of the verbal roots and the phonemes $r a$ etc. are elided before an affix with an indicatory letter $t a^{\prime \prime}$ (Kacc 541), kāritatī viya nānubandho "An affix with the indicatory letter $\underline{n} a$ should be treated as a causative affix" (Kacc 623), asaṁyogantassa vuddhi kārite "A verbal root not ending in a consonant cluster undergoes the vuddhi operation before a causative affix" (Kacc 485); ramhiranto rādi lopam no "All the final phonemes of the verbal roots and the phonemes $r a$ etc. are elided before an affix with an indicatory letter $t a^{\prime \prime}$ (Sadd 1124), nānubandho kāritatī va "An affix with the indicatory letter $\underline{n} a$ should be treated as a causative affix" (Sadd 1227), dhātussa asaññogantassa kārite vuddhi "A verbal root not ending in a consonant cluster undergoes the vuddhi operation before a causative affix" (Sadd 973).
anubandhas. Apart from this, we also come across two more anubandhas viz. $k a$ and gha in the rules occurring in the Unādikappa of the Kacc. Agg has also retained these anubandhas in his corresponding rules. They, however, do not serve any practical purpose in these grammars and thus seem to be blindly copied from the Sanskrit grammars. Mogg on the other hand has used fifteen anubandhas such as $a, i, u, k a, g h a, n ̃ a, c a, n ̃ a, t ̣ a, d a$, $n a, p a, m a, r a$ and la. These indicatory letters perform various functions such as:
a. Determining the position of an augment or a substitute
b. Effecting or prohibiting a particular morphophonemic change
c. Distinguishing one suffix from another
d. Eliding a particular element, etc.

Some of these functions are mentioned by Mogg in the body of rules ${ }^{1}$ whereas the remaining are stated in the Vutti. ${ }^{2}$ It is interesting to note that some of the anubandhas used by the Pali grammarians and their respective functions have much in common with their usage in the Sanskrit grammar.

K and Agg have formulated a rule teaching the elision of vocalic anubandhas [dhātussanto loponekasarassa "The final vowel of a multi-vocalic verbal root is sometimes elided" (Kacc 523), dhatuss' anto lopo'nekasarassa "The final vowel of a multi-vocalic verbal root is sometimes elided" (Sadd 1034)]. The dropping of the indicatory letter is, however, taught by K alone at kāritānañ no lopam "The indicatory letter na of the causative affixes is elided" (Kacc 525). For Mogg the dropping of the indicatory letters is unnecessary. Because, according to him, the indicatory letters do

not form a part of the word to which they are added. Cf. sañketo'navayavonubandho "The indicatory letter not forming a part of that to which it is attached is to be known as anubandha" (MV 1.23).

P has used a number of the indicatory letters and has entrusted them with a variety of functions such as deciding the position of a linguistic element, instigating morphophonemic changes, accentuation, etc. Indicatory letters used by P include not only consonants but also vowels, which are marked by special qualities like nasality (anunāsikatva) or tone (anudātta, udātta and svarita). Statements regarding the functions of the indicatory letters can be found in P's Aṣt. C follows P in this regard. Śarva on the other hand has used a limited number of the indicatory letters.

# Technique of Ready Mention (Nipātana) 

Sometimes grammarians confront with a form difficult to derive with the help of the scheme of the general and the particular rules. In such cases, they resort to a simpler method of mentioning the ready forms of such words in the shape of a grammatical aphorism. Such ready forms are traditionally known as nipātanas.

Here, there is a methodological difference between the Kacc and the Sadd on the one hand and the MV on the other. In the Kacc, it is stated that the forms, which cannot be derived by applying the existing rules, are to be derived by the method of nipātana [yadanupapannā nipātanā sijihanti (Kacc 393)]. However, no forms are given by way of ready mention except vajādīhi pabbajjādayo nipaccante (Kacc 640), which occurs in the Unādikappa. The number of nipātanas is also very small in Agg's Sadd. Note that Agg has formulated rules to explain even those forms, which are given as nipātanas by the other grammarians. Cf. Sadd 1339-1343. Cp.: tadaminādīni (MV 1.47), prṣodarādīni yathopadistam (P 6.3.109) and prṣodarādīni (C 5.2.127). At many
places Mogg has used a method of ready mention where K and Agg have adopted process of derivation. Cp. for instance, MV 4.96, 4.100, 4.104, 4.106-107 with Kacc 227-236, 249-262 and Sadd 456-465, 492-508; MV 4.127 with Kacc 263, 271, 404 and Sadd 104, 509, 781 and 857; MV 5.31 with Kacc 20, 544, 545 and Sadd 84,1127 and 1128.

The device of ready mention is long in use since the time of P . The subsequent grammarians found it very convenient for explaining irregular word forms. However, there had been no agreement among the grammarians on which words are to be derived and which should be given as ready forms.

# Use of Codified Suffixes 

Using the code letters to represent a particular surface form of a suffix is another means of achieving brevity. K and Agg have used two such codified suffixes. They are: $y u$ and $v u$. Cf. for instance: nandädīhi yu "An affix $y u$ is introduced after the verbal roots nanda etc. in the sense of 'an impersonal action' or 'an object'" (Kacc 549), nandādito yu "An affix $y u$ is introduced after the verbal roots nanda etc. in the sense of 'an impersonal action' or 'an object'" (Sadd 1133) and sabbato nvutvävī vā "The affixes a, $n v u$, tu and $\bar{a} v \bar{\imath}$ are optionally introduced after any verbal root either co-occurring with the direct object etc. or not" (Kacc 529), nvutvävī vā sabbāhi "The affixes a, nvu, tu and $\bar{a} v \bar{\imath}$ are optionally introduced after any verbal root either co-occurring with the direct object etc. or not" (Sadd 1109). Here anakā yuṇvūnam (Kacc 624, Sadd 1228) is a decoding sutta. It says that the affixes $y u$ and $n v u$ are substituted by ana and aka respectively.

Mogg has totally avoided the use of such codified suffixes. In order to achieve the simplicity of procedure, he has rather used the surface forms of such suffixes. For instance, in the place of the
code suffixes $y u, n v u$, Mogg uses ana and aka. Cf. ano "The affix ana is introduced after any verbal root in the sense of an agent" (MV 5.48), kattari Itunakā "The affixes Itu and naka are introduced after any verbal root in the sense of an agent" (MV 5.33).

P and C have used a number of codified suffixes such as $y u$, $v u$, pha, dha, kha, cha, gha and tha. Later, by using the decoding rules, these suffixes are substituted by ana, aka, āyan, eya, ina, iya, iya, and ika respectively. Here it should be noted that in the Pali grammars, the Pāninian code suffixes phak, dhak, cha, gha and thak are replaced by their corresponding surface forms āyana, ${ }^{1}$ eya, ${ }^{2}$ iya, ${ }^{3}$ īya, ${ }^{4}$ and $i k a^{5}$ respectively. The rules providing the decoding mechanisms are P 7.1.16; P 7.1.27; P 7.3.50 ${ }^{8}$ and CV 5.4.1-3. ${ }^{9}$ Sarva has used only two codified suffixes, $y u$ and $v u$ to represent the surface forms ana and aka respectively. Cf.: yuvujhāmanākāntāh (Kt 4.6.53).

# Use of the Particle $c a$ 

The conjunctive particle $c a$, which ordinarily conveys the sense of 'and' / 'or', was used by the grammarians from P onwards as a technical device in their compositions. Its main function in a grammatical text is to control the continuation of a particular element in an elliptical construction. In the Kacc, the primary function of this particle is to connect the rule in which it appears with the earlier context, for instance, pubbo ca "When the following vowel is elided then the preceding vowel is occasionally lengthened" (Kacc 16). Here the earlier context of lengthening of a vowel is continued in this rule by the force of $c a$. Normally, in the grammatical treatises, when the earlier context is continued by the force of $c a$, it does not continue in the subsequent rules. Cf. for instance, cānukrṣtaṁ nottaratra, lakkhaṇe cānukaḍdhita-vidhānam uttaratra nānuvattati (Sadd 1069). Thus, in these cases, the particle ca performs two different functions. On one hand it continues the earlier context while on the other hand, it stops it from being continued in the subsequent rules. This technical usage of the particle $c a$ first originated in P's Ast and was then adopted by all the grammarians who followed him.

On occasions, K's grammar becomes problematic due to its unscientific use of the conjunctive particle $c a$ and its interpretation. For instance, the use of $c a$ at do dhassa ca (Kacc 20) is incomprehensible as the rule is without relation to sabbo can $t i$ (Kacc 19). Commentators have used this ca to include many more instances of a phonetic change. ${ }^{1}$ In fact, in this case it serves no real purpose and thus can be treated as stylistic. The conventional conjunctive function of $c a$ is exploited by the commentators to such an extent that even thosee grammatical operations, which are in no way related to the concerned rule, are connected with it. According to them, "the particle ca conjoins whatever is already

[^0]
[^0]:    1 casaddaggahanena dhakārassa hakārādeso hoti "By the virtue of the inclusion of the word $c a, d h a$ is substituted by $h a$ " (Kacc-Vu 20).
described and yet to be described". ${ }^{1}$ Thus, it is used as a tool to explain a number of unexplained usages. The same is also true of other particles such as tu, api and abstract nouns. Cf. Kacc-Vu 83, ${ }^{2}$ Kacc-Vṇ 362, ${ }^{3}$ Rūp 74, ${ }^{4}$ Kacc-Vṇ 296, ${ }^{5}$ Kacc-Vu $90^{6}$ and Kacc-Vu 198. ${ }^{7}$

It appears that in a number of rules this particle was interpolated in order to explain forms, which are left unexplained by K. It is noteworthy that Agg has got rid of many of these superfluous mentions of the particle $c a$ by way of reformulating the original rules of the Kacc or by making new additions considering the comments of its commentators. For instance, Agg improves upon Kacc 261: imasmā rahidhunādāni ca, by removing the superfluous ca: idato rahidhunā dāni (Sadd 507). Similarly, the mention of the particle $c a$ in the rule yavamadanataralā cāgamā (Kacc 35) is accounted for by Agg by way of adding an augment ha in the given list. Kacc-Vu's interpretation of ca at do dhassa ca (Kacc 20), is incorporated by Agg at ho dhassa vannasandhimhi (Sadd 72). However, some rules of the Sadd are still problematic due to the unscientific use of this particle. Cf. Sadd 294, 307.

1 ayaṃ ca casaddo vuttāvuttasamuccayo (Kacc-Vṇ 75). Also cp. cakāro avuttasamuccayattho (MVu 5.70).
2 tusaddaggahanam avadhāranattham / "The particle $t u$ is for the purpose of restriction."

3 tusaddaggahanena ttanappaccayo hoti / "Due to the inclusion of the word tu, the suffix ttana is introduced in the sense of state or condition."
4 apiggahanam dutiyatthasampindanattham / "The inclusion of api is for the purpose of conjoining another meaning."
5 apiggahanena ... katthaci patisedheti / "By including api the application of the rule is prohibited on certain occasions."
6 attamiti bhāvaniddeso ubhayasāgamattham / "The abstract form attam is for the purpose of the insertion of the augment $s a . "$
7 uttamiti bhāvaniddeso katthaci abhāvam dasseti / "The abstract noun uttam indicates the absence of this change in some cases."
Mogg has been very careful about the use of the particle ca. His usage in this regard closely follows P and C .

# Use of the Option Markers 

The Pali grammarians have used a number of words and expressions to indicate an option. Apart from the well established option markers such as $v \bar{a}$, vibhāsā, na vā, bahulam, the Pali grammarians have used kvaci, pāyena etc. Besides, there are some expressions such as thāne, yathātanti, yathāgamam, matantare that also perform the same function.

Kiparsky has suggested that three Pāṇinian option markers $v \bar{a}$, vibhās $\bar{a}$ and anyatarasyām show three different levels of optionality in P's grammar. It appears that such minute distinctions are not observed so rigorously by the Pali grammarians. For example, in the rule $v \bar{a}$ paro asarūp $\bar{a}$ "A vowel is rarely elided after a non-homophonous vowel" (Kacc 13), $v \bar{a}$ is used in the sense of kvaci ('rarely'). Note that Mogg has taught the same change by using the word kvaci, e.g., paro kvaci "A vowel is sometimes elided after a vowel" (MV 1.27). On a number of occasions, MVu uses $v \bar{a}$ and $k v a c i$ together in the sense of an option. Cf. pubbaparasarā dvepi vā kvaci na lupyante "Sometimes both preceding and following vowels are not elided" (MVu 1.28). K's usage of $v \bar{a}$ is even more problematic as in some rules it is also used in a conjunctive and a disjunctive sense, e.g. yena vā kariyate tam karaṇam "Or that by means of which one acts that (käraka) is called karana 'instrument'" (Kacc 281). Also cp. the use of $v \bar{a}$ in rules yasmādapeti bhayamādatte vā tadapādānam "That from which something moves away or there is a fear, or someone takes, that (käraka) is an apādāna" (Kacc 273), and yassa dātukāmo rocate dhārayate vā tam sampadānam "The one to whom (an agent) has a desire to give, or to whom (something) is pleasing, or to whom one owes that (käraka is called) sampadāna" (Kacc 278).
Commenting on this type of the dual usage of $v \bar{a}$, Rūp says: vāggahaṇaṃ sampiṇdanatthaṃ vikappanattham vā "The mention of $v \bar{a}$ is for the sake of either conjunction or disjunction".
na vā, which is equivalent to the Pāṇninian vibhāsā, ${ }^{1}$ is used by the Pali grammarians in the sense of 'rarely', e.g., ivanno yam na $v \bar{a}$ "the phoneme $i$ rarely transforms into $y$ before a vowel" (Kacc 21). The term vibhās $\bar{a}$ is also used by them in rules Kacc 154, 325; Sadd 334. It is interesting to note that MVu sometimes paraphrases $v \bar{a}$ by vibhāsā, e.g. pum pumassa vā (MV 3.56) is paraphrased by MVu as: pumassa puṃ hotuttarapade vibhāsā /"As a first member of the compound, puma is optionally substituted by pum before the final member."

Bahulam, which ordinarily means 'often', is used and interpreted by Mogg (MV 1.58) as done by many Sanskrit commentators of the Aṣt. It is a tool in hands of Mogg to explain all sorts of linguistic irregularities. kvaci (MV 1.27, Sadd 146) and pāyena (Sadd 142) are used in their ordinary sense of 'rarely' and 'mostly' respectively. Other expressions such as thāne (Kacc 28) ('whenever there is an occasion'), yathātanti ('in accordance with the traditional usage) (Sadd 364), yathāgamam (Kacc 607) ('in accordance with the scriptural usage') indicate that the scope of that particular rule is limited only to certain usages. Apart from these, Agg has also used expressions such as gāthāyam, pāvacane, or atthakathāyam, which indicate that a particular usage is limited only to that particular form of the literature, e.g. Sadd 454, 674 and 979. Matantare is an expression used by Agg (Sadd 242) to indicate the contrasting views of other grammarians.

P has used various terms to express different shades of optionality like $v \bar{a}$, vibhās $\bar{a}$ and anyatarasyām. He has further used words like bahulam, alpaśah etc. and has also referred to the opinions of his predecessors and usage in different regions for expressing optionality. Sarva, however, has not been able to

[^0]
[^0]:    1 na veti vibhāsā (P 1.1.44).
maintain such subtlety with regard to the optional expressions. In the earliest portion of the Kt i.e. in the Sandhi section, na vā is used to denote vikalpa or vibhāsā. According to the commentators, in the Kt , the particle $v \bar{a}$ is used in two different senses, that of conjunction (samuccayārtha) and optionality (vikalpārtha). Thus, under vā virāme (Kt 2.3.62), Durgasiṃha says:
vāśabda iha samuccayārtho na vikalpārthah /
The Pali grammarians have made use of the Pāninian option markers $v \bar{a}$, na $v \bar{a}$, vibhāṣā and bahulam. However, like the Kt , they have not observed the subtleties of optionality indicated by these words. The Pāninian method of indicating an option by referring to the name of a particular region and the option marker anyatarasyām is absent in the Pali grammars.

# Mention of the Verbal Roots 

In K's grammar, the consonant ending verbal roots are generally mentioned with the phoneme $a$. Apart from this, K has also made use of other phonemes such as $i$ and $u$ for the same purpose. This usage is, however, not consistent as sometimes the root gam is referred to as gamu at Kacc 503, whereas the same root is mentioned as gami at Kacc 478. In a few cases, the verbal root is also mentioned with the present tense third person singular suffix ti, e.g., Kacc 538. Agg follows K in this respect. In Mogg's grammar, verbal roots are mentioned with three suffixes $i, k i$ (MV 5.77) and $t i$ (MV 5.128). Cf.: ikitī sarūpe "The affixes $i, k i$ and $t i$ are introduced after a verbal root to denote the actual form of that verbal root" (MV 5.52). Here Mogg has followed C. However, there is no formal difference between the suffixes $i$ and $k i$.
$a$ is used commonly by P and C while referring to the verbal roots to facilitate the pronunciation. Apart from this, the verbal roots are also mentioned with $i k$ and štip by P (ikštipau dhātunirdeśe - Vt. 3.3.108.2), and with $i, k i$ and štip by C (CV 1.3.96: ikištipah svarūpe). P. C. Dash (1986:68) informs us that in
spite of the mention of the suffix $\check{s} t i p, \mathrm{C}$ has never used it in his grammar for the given purpose.

# Absence of Abbreviations 

Apart from the technical devices mentioned above, P has made use of the technique of abbreviations in order to achieve economy. Abbreviations occupy a major portion of the meta-language used by P and C . In P's method, the first letter joined with the last letter stands for the intermediate letters of a word. In his system, such an abbreviation is called a pratyāhāra. A pratyāhāra is an abbreviatory symbol, which stands for a list of certain sounds. For this very purpose, P has introduced some changes in the traditional sequence of alphabets. He has used 41 pratyähāras throughout his grammar. This has added to the cryptic nature of his rules.

Clarity and simplicity are the main concerns of the Pali grammars. In keeping with these principles, the Pali grammarians have followed the traditional way of listing alphabets and have avoided the type of abbreviations introduced by P. In this case, they have followed Sarva and have used the traditional terminology in place of abbreviations. Thus, for the Pāninian abbreviation al, which represents all the syllables, the Pali grammarians have used akkhara. Similarly, for the Pāninian abbreviations $a c$ and hal, which represent vowels and consonants respectively, they have used the terms sara and vyañjana. It is noteworthy that although Mogg follows P and C in other technical matters, he has avoided the use of pratyähāras and has used the more familiar traditional terms in their place.

## Use of the Common Denominators

The technique of using the common denominators is another important feature of P's meta-language. In his grammar, tenses and moods are represented by the letter la, which is a common
denominator of their technical names such as lat, lit, lṭt etc. Similarly, lu is a common denominator of words denoting different types of elisions such as luk, šlu and lup.

The technique of using a common denominator is used by the Pali grammarians on a limited scale. In K and Agg's grammars, ntu / antu is used as a common denominator for the possessive suffixes vantu and mantu (Kacc 122, Sadd 297). According to ntu vantu-mantvāvantu-tavantu sambandhī (MV 1.25), in the MV, ntu is used as a common denominator for the suffixes vantu, mantu, avantu, and tavantu. However, in rest of the cases, the Pali grammarians have preferred the use of the more familiar terminology. Thus, tenses and moods are referred to by their traditional names such as parokkhā, vattamānā, bhavissantī etc.

# Principles Governing Selection of a Rule 

Often more than one rule finds scope in a given situation. In such cases, in order to resolve the conflict, the grammarians have laid down certain principles for selecting the right rule, e.g., P has laid down the principles of paratva (posteriority) and asiddhatva (inoperativeness) for resolving such conflicts. According to the principle of posteriority, in case of mutual conflict between two rules, the rule subsequent in order supersedes the earlier rule. The Pāninian rule in this regard is vipratisedhe param kāryam (P 1.4.2). As per the principle of asiddhatva, the rules from the asiddhakända (P 8.2 to P 8.4) are treated as non-existing or inoperative before the application of rules in the siddhakända (P 1.1 to P 8.1). In other words, in a conflict between a rule belonging to the siddhakända and a rule belonging to the asiddhakända, the rule belonging to the siddhakända supersedes the latter. Another implication of this principle is that when there is a conflict between two rules belonging to the asiddhakända, the earlier rule supersedes the posterior. The Pāninian rule in this regard is pūrvatrāsiddham (P 8.2.1).
Since these two principles are not sufficient to resolve all the conflicts, the commentators have invented some additional principles by taking hints from P's own work. The other principles are: nityatva (constancy), antaranga - bahiranga (interior exterior), and utsarga - apavāda (exception). The principle of nityatva is stated as: kvacit krtākrtaprasangamātreñāpi nityatā (Paribhāṣā 46) "Sometimes, the precedence between the two rules is determined even by the fact that which of the two simultaneously applicable rules finds scope even after the other rule is applied". The principle of antaranga - bahiranga states: asiddhami bahirangam antarange (Paribhāṣā 50) "When one and the same rule becomes simultaneously applicable at two places, the conflict is resolved by applying it first to the interior part and then to the exterior part". According to the principle of utsarga apavāda, a rule making a special statement overrules the rule making a general statement.

C also follows the same principles as that of P . The Kt only follows the principles of posteriority and exception. The siddha asiddha dichotomy is absent in Sarva's grammar.

The Pali grammarians also seem to follow only two principles, that of posteriority and exception. The application of the principle of posteriority, however, seems to be restricted only to those cases where there is a conflict regarding the selection of correct personal endings. K and Agg's rules in this connection are: sabbesamekābhidhāne paro puriso (Kacc 411), and ekābhidhāne paro puriso (Sadd 868). According to these rules "when more than one set of personal endings is simultaneously applicable, then the endings that are taught in the earlier rules are superseded by those taught in the latter ones". These correspond to yugapad vacane parah puruṣānām (Kt 3.1.4). Mogg's rule in this regard is: vippatisedhe "When two rules are simultaneously applicable in the same place the posterior rule becomes applicable" (MV 1.22).
Although it is a general rule, Mogg has only applied it in the case of personal terminations.

The principle of exception is the main principle, which governs the selection of rules in these grammars. According to this principle, the general rule is superseded by the particular rule, e.g., the general rule vā nappacce "The suffix na is optionally introduced after any root to denote his / her offspring" (Kacc 346) is superseded by the specific rule ato ni $v \bar{a}$ "The suffix $n i$ is optionally introduced after nouns ending in the phoneme $a$ to denote his / her offspring" (Kacc 349). This rule is further superseded by a more specific rule: ŋāyana-nāna vacchādito "The suffixes nāyana and nāna are optionally introduced after the nouns vaccha etc. to denote an offspring of that family" (Kacc 347).

Out of other Pāṇinian principles, only the principle of antaranga is once mentioned at MVu 2.116:
pageva kasmā na hoti? antaranigattā akārassa /
"Why the rule [Iopo] is not applied earlier? Because, the substitution of $a$ is interior [as compared to the elision]."
Here, in the situation aggi + yo, two rules become simultaneously applicable. The first rule is yosu jhissa pume (MV 2.95). This rule teaches the substitution of $a$ in place of the phoneme $i$ of the masculine nominal stems called jha before the suffix yo of the nominative or the accusative. The second rule Iopo (MV 2.116) on the other hand teaches the elision of the suffix yo of the nominative and the accusative introduced after the phonemes $i$ and $u$, which have the technical names jha and la respectively. In this case, the conflict is resolved in favour of MV 2.95 as the operation taught by this rule is interior, compared to the one taught by MV 2.116.

The principle of nityatva is, however, never mentioned by the Pali grammarians. The siddha - asiddha dichotomy, which is the hallmark of P's Ast, is absent in Pali grammars.
# Grammatical Description 

## Alphabet

The Pali grammarians follow the traditional method of listing the alphabets, which is already met with in the Kt. The alphabets are given at the beginning of every grammar, i.e. at Kacc 2, Sadd 1 and MV 1.1. The number of alphabets found in the Kacc and the Sadd is 41 whereas Mogg has listed 43 alphabets including short $e$ and short $o$. By listing all the alphabets, the Pali grammarians have provided a complete picture of the Pali phonetics.

The grammars of P and C begin with rules known as the pratyāhāra sūtras. In these rules, the phonemes are listed with the indicatory letters $n, k$ etc. to form abbreviations (pratyāhāra sūtras). The sequence of phonemes has been changed to suit the formation of the abbreviations. What these rules present are not phones but phonemes. These pratyāhāra sūtras do not present a complete picture of the Sanskrit phonology, as they do not list all the existing sounds of the Sanskrit language, e.g., sounds such as visarga, anusvāra, upadhmānīya, jihvāmūlīya etc., which are traditionally known as ayogavāhas, have not found any place in these rules.

## Treatment of Sandhi

The Pali grammarians have generally dealt with three types of sandhi: a vowel sandhi, a consonantal sandhi and a miscellaneous sandhi, which includes niggahīta sandhi and the sandhi metri causa.

The Pali grammarians' treatment of sandhi greatly differs from the treatment given by P on the following points:
1. Method of carrying out sandhi: In their grammars, both K and Agg have laid down rules for carrying out the sandhi operation. Cf. Kacc 10-11, Sadd 28-29. According to this method, the sandhi operation is carried out in two steps. In the first step, the preceding syllable is separated from its vowel and placed below it. In the second step, the same syllable is combined with the following syllable after effecting the necessary changes. This procedure clearly suggests the existence of a graphic practice of presenting a particular sandhi form. Vararuci's Prākṛtaprakāśa also presupposes a similar practice. Such a procedure is, however, absent in the MV and other Sanskrit grammars.
2. Absence of the governing rule samhitäyām: Following the Kt and other non-Pāṇinian schools, the Pali grammarians have discarded the governing rule samhitäyām, which provides the ground for making sandhi in P's Aṣṭ.
3. Absence of the technique of the ekādeśa: Like the Kt, the Pali grammarians have also not followed the ekādeśa technique of P , for example, in P's grammar, the sandhi between $n a+$ upaiti is formed by replacing both - the final $a$ of $n a$ and the initial $u$ of upaiti - by a single substitute $o$ by the rule $\bar{a} d$ guṇah ( P 6.1.87). The same form can be derived in the system of the Kt by applying uvarne $o$ (Kt 1.2.3). Here, the initial $u$ of the word upaiti is elided and at the same time the preceding phoneme $a$ is substituted by $o$. The procedure followed by the Pali grammarians to derive the sandhi form nopeti from $n a+$ upeti is different than the Kt. According to them, first, the final $a$ of $n a$ is dropped and then the initial $u$ of upeti is substituted by $o$. In the same vein, the Pāṇinian pararūpa and pūrvarūpa ekādeśas are reduced merely to the elision of the preceding or the following vowel respectively, e.g. Kacc 12, Sadd 30, 32-33, MV 1.26.
4. Absence of a complicated procedure: The Pali grammarians' treatment of sandhi is prompted by the desire to reduce the
complicated procedure of the Sanskrit grammarians, to a simple process in arriving at the final form. Thus, they have tried to connect the root form directly with the surface form.

Agg stands alone among the Pali grammarians in giving a separate treatment to the phonetic changes caused by the metrical composition, e.g. Sadd 158-159. It is noteworthy that even the Sanskrit grammarians have not dealt with such changes in their grammars. Similarly, among the Pali grammarians, Agg alone has dealt with the sandhi peculiar to a particular form of literature (Sadd 70, 134, 156, 160).

# Nominal Inflection 

The Pali grammarians do not list the case terminations in the same way as P does. As in the Kt , the nominative singular suffix is given as $s i$ instead of $s u$ given by P .

Some linguistic categories such as sarvanāmasthāna and bha, which are conceived by P in order to explain the strong, the medium and the weak categories of the nominal inflections, are missing in the Pali grammars.

The inflectional procedure is more simple than that of P's, e.g., the nominative singular form buddho can be derived in three steps by applying three rules: siyo an̉yo nāhi sanam smāhi sanam smimsu (Kacc 55), so (Kacc 104), sarā sare lopam (Kacc 12); si yo aṁ yo nā hi sa nam smā hi sa nam smim su (Sadd 200), sissa o (Sadd 272), sarā lopam papponti sare (Sadd 30) and dve dve kānekesu nāmasmā si yo aṁ yo nā hi sa nam smā hi sa nam smim su (MV 2.1), sisso (MV 2.111), saro lopo sare (MV 1.26). ${ }^{1}$ In P's

1 1. Buddha $+s i$
2. Buddha $+o$
3. Buddh $+o$
grammar, one has to follow at least four steps to arrive at the nominative singular form rāmah. ${ }^{1}$

# Syntax 

The Pali grammarians' treatment of kārakas is in no way exhaustive. The kāraka section of these grammars only deals with the general facts about the syntax of the Pali language and does not enter in the subtleties as recorded in P's Ast. As shown by E. Kahrs, it does not provide a correct picture of the Pali syntax. On a number of occasions, the syntactic peculiarities of Sanskrit are superimposed on Pali.

P clearly maintains a dichotomy between kāraka and vibhakti. His kārakas stand for the deep or underlying relation of a noun to the verb and the vibhaktis stand for the representation of kārakas in the surface structure. This dichotomy is not noticed in the Pali grammars. Although K and Agg have dealt with the kārakas and the vibhattis separately, on a number of occasions they have mixed these two categories, e.g., the ablative in connection with the prefixes apa and $\bar{a}$ is treated as a kāraka vibhatti by K and Agg whereas in P's Ast it is treated as an upapada vibhakti. Cf. dhātunāmānamupasaggayogādisvapi ca "When there is a syntactic relation with a verbal root or a noun as well as with the prefix etc. that kāraka is called apādāna" (Kacc 274), vajjanatthāpapariyoge "When there is a syntactic relation with apa and pari, conveying the sense of avoiding that kāraka is called apādāna" (Sadd 560); pañcamy apāприaribhih "The fifth sup triplet is introduced [after a nominal stem cooccurring with karmapravacanīyas] apa, ā̄̄ and

1 1. Rāma $+s u$ (P 4.1.2: svaujsamaut ...)
2. Rāma $+s$ - dropping of $u$ (P 1.3.2: upadesse'j anunāsika it, tasya lopah).
3. Rāma $+r u-s$ changes to $r u$ (P 8.2.66: sasajuso ruh)
4. Rāmah - ru changes to visarga (P 8.3.15: kharavasānayor visarjanīyah).
pari" (P 2.3.10). Like C, Mogg has merged the kāraka and the vibhatti sections together. He has not laid down rules defining various kāraka categories. His main focus is on the allocation of cases.

# Compounds 

K's treatment of compounds is general in nature like that of Sarva. Although Mogg has dealt with some particular cases, his treatment of the compounds is not as exhaustive as that of P who provides rules for particular cases. Agg has, however, discussed many instances of compounds particular to Pali.

In the matter of rule formation, K and Agg have followed the descriptive style of Sarva. Mogg on the other hand has closely followed C.

On occasions, Agg and Mogg's description of the Pali compounds is misleading, as some compounds that are described by them are not instantiated in the Pali literature, e.g. compounds like tiṭthagu etc. Cf. Sadd 697 and MV 3.7. Besides, some compounds, which are classified by the Pali grammarians as the avyayibhāva type of compounds, do not actually possess that status in Pali, e.g. adhicitta. Kacc-Vu has misinterpreted jāyāya tudamjāni patimhi (Kacc 341) and has derived the ghost form tudampati. Agg has repeated the same mistake in the rule jāyāya kvaci tudamjāni patimhi (Sadd 731).

## Taddhita

The Pali grammarians' treatment of taddhita is extremely cursory compared to that of P. P's treatment of taddhita is spread over 1110 rules in the Aṣt whereas the same topic has been dealt with in 62 rules in the Kacc, 114 rules in the Sadd and 142 rules in the MV. Even in this section, the Pali grammarians have only
considered some of the important taddhita meanings and suffixes. Thus, their treatment of taddhita is like a brief summary of P's taddhita section.

Composition of P's taddhita section is very complex due to the interweaving of arthādhikāras (governing meanings) and pratyayādhikāras (governing suffixes). Such a complex structure is, however, not adopted by the Pali grammarians K and Agg for the sake of simplicity. Mogg on the other hand, has adopted an alternate arrangement of governing meaning and governing suffix, for instance, rules 4.1 to 4.10 teach various suffixes in the sense of 'an offspring' (apacca), rules 4.11 to 4.20 teach various meanings of the suffix $n a$, rules 4.20 to 4.26 teach various suffixes in the sense of 'existing there' and rules 4.26 to 4.33 teach various meanings of the suffix nika.

# Treatment of Verbal Inflection 

K and Agg have followed the Kt and other non-Pāṇinian Sanskrit grammarians in accepting the familiar significant terms like adyatanī, śvastanī, bhavisyantī etc. for the ten Pāninian lakāras.

To bring simplicity, the Pali grammarians have totally discarded the Pāṇinian notion of substitution in case of the lakāras. They have simply given eight sets of twelve suffixes each and then in the following rules have taught the necessary alterations in these suffixes.

While the theory of substitution is discarded in respect of the lakāras, it is more closely adhered to by them in respect of the verbal morphophonemics. However, the level of substitution found in the Aṣt is higher than the Pali grammars. In the Pali grammars too, the level of substitution is higher in Mogg compared to the other two grammars. To illustrate, P has taught only one causative
suffix $n^{1}$ against two ( $n i$ and $n \bar{a} p i$ ) taught in the $\mathrm{MV}^{2}$ and four ( $n e$, naya, nāpe, nāpaya) in the Kacc and the Sadd. ${ }^{3}$ Thus, P teaches only one basic suffix and then derives different surface forms by way of introducing morphophonemic changes. Cp. for instance the derivation of the word adhyāpayati in P's grammar:
adhi i nic
adhi $i i$
adhi à i (P 6.1.48: krī-iñ-jīnāṃ nau)
adhi āp i(P 7.3.36: artihrīvli...)
adhi āpi ti(P 3.4.78: tiptas...)
adhi āpi a ti(P 3.1.68: kartari śap)
adhi āpe a ti(P 7.3.84: sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoh)
adhi āpay a ti (P 6.1.77: iko yan aci, P 6.1.78: eco'yavāyāvah)
adhyāpayati
K and Agg on the other hand have accepted four different surface forms as four different suffixes.

On a number of occasions, K and Agg prescribe a substitute for an entire root instead of splitting the root into smaller phonemic units as done by Mogg. Cp. for instance, jaramarānam

[^0]
[^0]:    1 P 3.1.26: hetumati ca.
    2 MV 5.16: payojakavyāpāre nāpi ca.
    3 Kacc 440: dhātūhi ṇenayaṇāpeñāpayā kāritāni hetvatthe / Sadd 914: ne-naya-nāpe-nāpayā hetvatthe dhātuto, kāritā ca te/
jīrajiyyamiyy $\bar{a}$ vā "The verbal roots jara and mara are optionally substituted by jīra, jiyya and miyya" (Kacc 507), sadassa sīdattam "On all occasions, the verbal root sada is substituted by sida" (Kacc 611), sadassa sīdo "The verbal root sada is substituted by sīda" (Sadd 1213); and jarasadānamīma vā "An augment $\bar{\imath}$ is optionally introduced after the final vowel of the roots jara and sada" (MV 5.123), jaramarānamīyañ "The final phoneme of the verbal roots jara and mara are substituted by īya before the affixes nta, māna and $t i$ etc." (MV 5.174).

In order to save students of the laborious toiling with complicated procedures involving augmentation, substitution and elision, the Pali grammarians have linked the basic form of the root directly with its surface appearance, e.g., according to the Pali grammarians, the form pacanti is derived in the following steps:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { pac }+ \text { anti (Kacc 425, Sadd 896, MV 6.1) } \\
& \text { pac }+a+ \text { anti (Kacc 447, Sadd 925, MV 5.18) } \\
& \text { pacanti (Kacc 12, Sadd 30, MV 1.26) }
\end{aligned}
$$

On the other hand, according to P , the same form is derived in the following steps:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { pac }+1 a \\
& \text { pac }+1 a t(\mathrm{P} 3.2 .123) \\
& \text { pac }+s ̌ a p+j h i(\mathrm{P} 3.1 .68) \\
& \text { pac }+a+ \text { anti (P 3.4.77-78) } \\
& \text { pac + anti (P 7.1.3) } \\
& \text { pacanti (P 6.1.91) }
\end{aligned}
$$

This weeding out of the intermediate procedure is a telling example of the Pali grammarians' high concern for lucidity in the grammatical procedure.
# Treatment of Primary Derivatives 

The Pali grammarians' treatment of the primary derivatives is also of a general nature. The krdanta section of P's Ast is spread over 590 rules excluding the rules of morphophonemic changes ( P 3.1.1-3.4.76). Compared to this, the treatment of primary derivatives is spread over 100 rules of the Kacc (526-625), 125 of the Sadd (1106-1230) and 179 of the MV (5.1-79) including rules related to the morphophonemics.

In the Kacc and the Sadd, the technical name kit is given to a number of primary affixes excluding the gerundive affixes and the finite verbal endings. Note that in P's Ast, the gerundive affixes are also included in the primary affixes.

## Difference in the Grammatical Description

On a number of occasions, the derivational method adopted by Mogg differs from that of K and Agg. For instance, the forms such as esa dhammo and sa sīlavā are derived by K and Agg by means of teaching an augment whereas they are derived by Mogg by way of teaching a substitute (Kacc 27, Sadd 66). Another instance of difference in the treatment can be found in K and Agg's treatment of the form paro sahassam bhikkhusatam. In this case, K and Agg have explained the form by way of teaching an augment (Kacc 36, Sadd 130). Mogg on the other hand explains it by way of teaching a substitute. Forms like akāra, kakāra are explained by K and Agg by way of the suffix kāra (Kacc 606, Sadd 1208). Mogg on the other hand treats them as compounds (MVu 5.52). Similarly, K and Agg have explained the form vid $\bar{u}$ by way of teaching an augment $\bar{u}$ whereas Mogg teaches it by way of teaching the suffix $\bar{u}$ (Kacc 618, Sadd 1222, MV 5.38).
# Observations 

1. The nature of the Pali grammars is more pedagogic compared to the mnemonic nature of P's Ast.
2. The Pali grammarians' arrangement of topics is mainly based on the derivational types whereas P and C appear to have laid more emphasis on the derivational procedure.
3. Although the Pali grammarians have followed the same manner of description by way of general and particular rules, their level of generalizations is not as high as that of P.
4. The suttas of the Pali grammarians are descriptive and simple compared to the compressed and cryptic nature of P's sūtras.
5. In the matter of rule formation, the pattern followed by K and Agg is similar to that of Sarva and of Mogg with that of P and C .
6. The Pali grammarians have followed the nominal style of rule formation. In this regard, the usage of K and Agg is similar to that of Sarva whereas the usage of Mogg is more in accordance with the usage of P and C .
7. In the use of the meta-language, Mogg's usage matches more with that of P and C . K and Agg on the other hand have followed the footsteps of Sarva. The same is also true in case of other technical devices such as ellipsis, section headings, indicatory letters etc.
8. In the matter of codified suffixes, K and Agg have followed Sarva. Mogg on the other hand has totally avoided the use of these suffixes.
9. On a number of occasions, K and Agg's usage of the particle $c a$ is unscientific. Mogg on the other hand has used it with greater skills.
10. The Pali grammarians have used more option markers compared to that of P. However, they failed to preserve the subtleties regarding the levels of optionality found in P's grammar.
11. The Pali grammarians have mentioned the verbal roots in the same way as they are mentioned by the Sanskrit grammarians.
12. Like Sarva, the Pali grammarians have avoided the use of abbreviations and common denominators.
13. With regard to the principles governing the selection of rules, the Pali grammarians have accepted the Pāninian principle of exception. Though the principle of posteriority is also accepted by them, the area of its application is limited. Out of the other Pāninian principles, only the principle of antaranigatva (interiority) is referred to by Mogg. The siddha-asiddha dichotomy is missing in Pali grammars.
14. The Pali grammarians' treatment of the language is general in nature.
15. The Pali grammarians have tried to simplify the overall grammatical procedure by weeding out the intermediate procedures.
16. To conclude, for P , technique and economy of expression are of utmost importance whereas for the Pali grammarians, the simplicity of the grammatical procedure and clarity of expression are of prime importance. In spite of this, one has to accept that from the days of the composition of the first indigenous grammar of Pali in the form of the Kacc, the
Pali grammars have exhibited a progressive trend towards a greater systematization, sophistication and accuracy of description.
# Chapter Four 

## Conclusion

In the foregoing chapters, it has been shown that the Pali grammatical tradition continued to develop since the time of its inception in the form of K's grammar. Unlike the Prakrit grammar, it presents itself as an independent and complete grammatical system like that of Sanskrit. The main reason behind the endeavor to construct a comprehensive grammar seems to be to give the same status to the Pali language as is enjoyed by Sanskrit.

For writing their grammars, the Pali grammarians have accepted the already established and tested model of the Sanskrit grammar. When K composed his grammar there were two models available to him. The first was that of P's Ast and the second was in the form of Sarva's Kt. Out of these, the author of the Kacc accepted the latter, which was more concise and simple as compared to that of P's Ast. It has been already proposed that K's grammar is an attempt to prepare a guiding manual of the Pali grammar for the monastic community, which wanted to learn the Buddha's words in a simple but efficient way. Sarva's Kt was the best model for such a manual. It is also possible that the choice of the Kt in this regard was prompted by the popularity of that grammar in the particular time and region to which the author of the Kacc belonged. Here it may be noted that Bhartṛhari, the celebrated author of they Vākya (5th / 7th century A.D., which is also the proposed date of the Kacc) informs us that Candrācārya and others revived the Pāninian tradition, which was almost lost before his time.
yaḥ pātañjalaśiṣyebhyo bhraṣto vyākaraṇāgamaḥ /
kāle sa dākṣīnātyeṣu granthamātre vyavasthitaḥ //
parvatād āgamaṃ labdhvā bhāṣyabījānusāribhih/ sa nīto bahumārgatvaṃ candrācāryādibhih punaḥ //
(Vākya II.480-481)
This implies that P's grammar was not so popular before the time of the Kacc.

Agg followed the basic framework of K's grammar but tried to improve upon it by way of incorporating the material available in the Kacc's commentary. He further tried to blend it with the vast amount of information available in the exegetical literature of the Atṭhakathās. Apart from this, he also made use of the material available in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition of P and Śarva, which came down to him through direct or indirect sources.

Mogg has generally accepted the basic framework of the Kacc with a few minor changes in the arrangement of the main topics and sub-topics. However, he tried to bring in more systematization in the overall presentation of the grammatical data. In this regard, he has carefully adopted the technically sophisticated model C.

In the second chapter, we have taken a detailed stock of the grammatical terminology used by the three Pali grammarians. We have also tried to find out its sources in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition by studying the origin and the development of a particular grammatical term in that tradition. In the third chapter, we have studied and compared the technique adopted by these grammarians.

The major findings of our inquiry into the technical terminology and the technique of the Pali grammarians are as follows:

1. The Pali Atṭhakathās of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta and Dhammapāla show the existence of a limited indigenous Pali grammatical terminology different from that of Sanskrit.
2. Out of 166 terms studied, 52 terms ( $33 \%$ ) are common to all the Pali grammarians, 102 terms (around 65\%) are common to K and Agg and 59 terms (around 37\%) are common to Agg and Mogg. On 38 occasions, Mogg gives a different term than the other two grammarians whereas three terms of the MV are
without parallel in other two Pali grammars. There are 16 instances where Agg's terminology is without parallel in other two grammars, primarily due to the terms taken from the Atṭhakathās.
3. Around $80 \%$ of the terms used by the Pali grammarians come from Sanskrit sources. While many of these are familiar from the standard grammar books (Aṣt, Kt, CV, and their respective commentaries), others are drawn from the Brāhmaṇas, Y's Nir, the Prātiśākhyas and the Śikṣā literature.

K follows Śarva not only in terms of the basic framework of his grammar but also in his technical terminology and technique. Kacc 9 quite clearly shows that the author of the Kacc presupposes knowledge of the grammatical terminology current in the Sanskrit grammatical parlance. The major portion (around 82\%) of K's technical terminology and their definitions are taken from the Kt . Only those technical terms of P's grammar, which are common to the Kt , (around 63\%) - with the sole exception of ekaśesa / ekasesa - found their way in K's grammar. Niggahita is the only term, which seems to be taken from the traditional Atṭhakathā terminology. It is without parallel in the Sanskrit grammatical literature. It is quite surprising that in spite of the availability of the indigenous phonetic as well as the case terminology, the author of the Kacc preferred the technical terminology that was current in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. As for K's original contribution to the field of the technical terminology, it is limited to five arbitrary monosyllabic terms such as jha, la, pa, gha, ga and two self-explanatory terms such as okäsa (a term denoting the locative case) and visariyoga (a term denoting simplification of consonant clusters). With the exception of the last one, which is peculiar to Pali, it is unclear why K resorted to these new terms, when terms for these ideas were already present in the Sanskrit tradition.

The technical terminology used by Agg is a mixture of the traditional terminology used in the Pali Atṭhakathās and the terminology that came down to him from the grammarians who
preceded him. He seems to present his grammar in dual form: on one hand, he wants to present the linguistic data in the format adopted by the grammarians and on the other hand, he also wants to make his readers acquainted with the conventional linguistic analysis found in the exegetical tradition. This explains why he has used twofold terminology i.e. the terminology common in the grammatical parlance and the terminology, which is peculiar to the exegetical literature.

As shown above, the bulk of Agg's technical terminology comes from the Kacc, as a result of which, it also shows greater affinity with the Kt. Out of 127 terms that are used by Agg, 86 are common to the Kt (a little less than 70\%). Although he has not made any new contribution in the field of the technical terminology and technique, his merit lies in the fact that he has presented all the available information in the tradition of the grammar and the Atthakathās in a collected form and has provided definitions and explanations also of those terms, which are left unexplained by K. Besides being encyclopaedic, his grammar shows improvement over the Kacc in the matter of the amount of grammatical data discussed as well as the accuracy and clarity in rule formation.

In this scenario, it is noticeable that Mogg, though he has followed the basic framework of K , has initiated changes in the field of the technical terminology and the technique. As it has been already shown, in the matter of the technical terminology, the changes introduced by Mogg are mainly prompted by the CV and the CVr. Out of 100 terms used by Mogg, 58 are common to the CV (58\%), whereas only 40-45 (including those overlapping with the CV ) are from the Ast and the Kt . About the technical side of his grammar, it can be said that Mogg tried to give a new face to the grammatical description by making it more systematic and precise with the help of the technical devices already introduced by P and C. However, in doing so, Mogg has tried to strike a balance between simplicity, on one hand, and complexity of the technique, on the other. In this regard, Mogg's proneness to the grammar of C
seems to be prompted by an urge to revolutionize the older tradition of K's grammar by adopting C's superior technique. In this respect, Mogg might have preferred C to P either because C has improved upon P by incorporating suggestions made by Kātyāyana and Patañjali or simple because of former being a fellow Buddhist. Cf. Belvalkar (1976:29).

The above-mentioned details reveal certain facts about the development of the Pali grammars. It throws some light on the purpose and the beliefs of the Pali grammarians. The project of the Pali grammarians, starting from K, was to compose the grammar for the language of the Buddhavacanas in that very language. As mentioned above, the Kacc was composed in the $6^{\text {th }}-7^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. i.e. in the period not long after the Atthakathās of Buddhaghosa and before the composition of the Tīkās and the Anuttikās. The author of the Kacc, who knew well the merit of the much developed Sanskrit grammatical tradition, probably felt the need of a perfect grammar book not only for the comprehension and explanation of the Buddhavacanas but also for the effective teaching of the same to the monastic community. Although the Atthakathās were useful for the first two purposes, they could not be used for teaching Pali. One can easily understand the importance of such a textbook of grammar in the period of the Pali renaissance when monks were required not only to read and understand Pali but also to write in it. The study of the Kacc on the one hand and the early commentarial literature on the other, reveal the fact that both these traditions grew independently of one another. K has based his grammatical analysis and description of Pali not on the Atṭhakathās but on Sanskrit grammar in general and on Sarva's Kt in particular. In accordance with this tendency, instead of the conventional terminology of the Atthakathās, he has adopted the well established technical terminology of Sanskrit grammars. His inclination for the unconventional terminology can be ascertained from his invention of the arbitrary, monosyllabic technical terms. However, from his choice of the descriptive model of Sarva over the theoretical model of P clearly indicates that he was not aiming at creating an indigenous Vyākaraṇaśāstra of Pali.
As mentioned before, his purpose was simply to prepare the textbook of the language of the Tipitaka on the lines of the Sanskrit grammar.

After K, the Pali grammatical tradition developed more or less on a similar line. However, it did try to bring itself closer to the Aṭthakathā tradition. This is quite evident from the works of Mogg and Agg. Between these two more or less contemporary grammars, Agg's Sadd seem to be more in favour of the Aṭthakathā tradition as it not only incorporates the linguistic analysis found in the Atṭhakathās but also introduces the technical terminology used therein. It clearly distinguishes between the description of grammarians (Saddavidī) and experts of scriptures (Sāsanikas) and favours the latter. In this connection, it is noteworthy that Agg calls his work as nīti i.e. guidance or practice and not as vyākarana or lakkhana i.e. explanation or definition. He approves of different ways of explaining a single linguistic phenomenon and thus justifies his attempt of putting the commentarial explanation side by side of those found in the grammatical works. The sources of these grammatical explanations can be traced back to the tradition of K or to the works of P , Śarva, Candra and their commentators.

Mogg on the other hand developed this tradition on technical line. Although he incorporates some discussions found in the Aṭthakathās, he neither adopts the terminology nor the methodology of the Aṭthakathās. His choice of the more sophisticated technical terminology and technique of the CV is the testimony of his quest for accuracy and systematization. As mentioned before, the MV is a complete grammatical system with the Suttapāṭha, the Dhātupāṭha, the Gaṇapāṭha and the Nvādipāṭha. Creation of such an accomplished grammatical system seems to be motivated by the urge to bring the Pali grammatical tradition at par with Sanskrit.

This difference in the attitude of Mogg and Agg seem to be governed by their respective environments, motives and beliefs. Agg is in favour of combining the tradition of the Aṭthakathās and
grammar even at the cost of bulkiness of his work, for he believes that by doing so he would be able to provide to his readers much required proficiency and insight into the canonical and the noncanonical literature. Mogg on the other hand seems to be motivated by the accuracy and the efficacy of the Sanskrit grammar. By combining the two distinct styles of K and C , he tries to strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication.

These are some primary observations based on our study of the technical terminology and the technique of the Pali grammarians. However, these are in no way conclusive considering the limited scope of this work. There is a need of further investigation of the remaining aspects of these grammars to get a clearer picture of the development of the Pali grammatical tradition and its relationship with the Sanskrit grammars.
