# Pāli Grammar and Grammarians from Buddhaghosa to Vajirabuddhi: A Survey 

## I. Introduction

§ I. Since the publication of R.O. Franke's study Geschichte und Kritik der einheimischen Pāli-Grammatik und -Lexicographie (PGL) in 1902 which constitutes the first and so far only attempt at writing an outline of the history and development of indigenous Pāli grammars, little research has been carried out in this vast and largely unexplored field. ${ }^{1}$ When Franke wrote his monograph he did not consider historically important grammars like Vajirabuddhi's Mukhamattadīpanī (Mmd) mainly basing his study on Kaccāyana (Kacc) and Kaccāyanavutti (Kacc-v), Rūpasiddhi (Rūp), Moggallāna (Mogg), Moggallānavutti (Mogg-v), and fragments of Saddanīti (Sadd), nor did he attempt a more thorough study of the literature he chose to focus upon. Thus the limited textual basis of Franke's study sometimes made him draw conclusions which are no longer valid. Now that all important surviving grammars have been published, there is reason to make another attempt at writing a survey of the indigenous Pāli grammars in a historical perspective: first of all, Helmer Smith has published his monumental edition of Aggavaṃsa's Saddanīti which in many ways constitutes the culmination of centuries of indigenous Pāli philology. Other historically important works like Kaccāyanasuttaniddesa (Kacc-nidd) and Moggallānapañcikā (Mogg-p) have also been published as well as a substantial number of minor grammatical works together with their commentaries. ${ }^{2}$

Consequently, the basis for evaluating the extant Pāli grammars has been widened considerably: it is now possible to study the statements of the Pāli grammarians in a more comprehensive historical context. This is especially important for a correct evaluation of their descriptive method: as a rule they would either formulate new rules or re-formulate the rules embodied in Kacc and Kacc-v so as to improve upon their grammatical description of the many phonological, morphological, and syntactical features of the Pāli. This was done on the basis of a comprehensive collection of examples from canonical and post-canonical literature. ${ }^{3}$ Thus the study of the Pāli grammars from a historical perspective is likely to shed light upon the transmission of the canonical and post-canonical literature.
§ 2. A substantial part of post-Kaccāyana grammatical literature is no longer extant. Thus we are only informed about important works through grammars like Mmd (see IV.3.1), Rūp, Rūp-t, Mogg, Mogg-p, and Sadd which occasionally quote or discuss statements found in Mahānirutti (Mahā-nir) (see IV.2.2), Niruttipiṭaka (Nir-piṭ) (see IV.2.4), Cūḷanirutti (Cūḷ-nir) (see IV.2.5), Mañjūsā (Mañj) (see IV.2.6), Sañgaha (Sgh) (see IV.2.7), Mahāsandhippakaraṇa (Mahā-s) (see IV.2.8), Cūḷasandhi (Cūl-s) (see IV.6.9), etc. Without these references it would have been impossible to form an idea of the history and development of Pāli grammar. Direct as well as indirect evidence indicates that these works have exerted a great influence on subsequent Pāli grammarians. Thus, for instance, Mañj affected the description of the kāraka system in Rūp, which in turn was used by Aggavaṃsa who copied verbatim several of the relevant paragraphs from Rūp. ${ }^{4}$ In those circumstances - there are many other examples - it is clear that the Pāli grammars have to be studied from a historical perspective, otherwise the context of certain of their statements or discussions remains incomprehensible.

§ 3. In addition to main works like Kacc, Kacc-v, Mmd, Rūp, Mogg, and Sadd, Pāli grammarians mention or quote many other treatises. Thus, for instance, Kaccāyanasuttaniddesa (Kacc-nidd) - no doubt the most important source of information on grammatical literature in the fifteenth century A.D. - quotes as many as twenty-five grammatical treatises in addition to well-known works like Nyāsa (= Mmd), Rūp, Sadd, and Mogg: I.

§5. Faced with this overwhelming number of works and the regrettable fact that virtually no research has been carried out in this vast field, it is obvious that a selection has to be made in the context of a brief survey. Since there is no hope of understanding the history and development of Pāli grammar without knowledge of the works that in one way or another shaped the tradition, it seems justified in the present case to focus primarily, although briefly, on those works that belong to the formative period of Pāli grammar, that is to say, the period that stretches from the time of composition of Buddhaghosa's Atṭhakathās through the complicated history of Kacc and Kacc-v to the completion of Vajirabuddhi's Mmd, presumably in the tenth century A.D. The treatment is not intended to be exhaustive. ${ }^{38}$ The main purpose has been to shed light upon important aspects of the early history and development of indigenous Pāli grammars.

# II. Grammar in the Pāli Atṭhakathās 

## II.I. Grammatical Terminology of the Atṭhakathās

§6. Buddhaghosa (fifth century A.D.) occasionally focuses on points of grammar in Visuddhimagga and the Atṭhakathās in order to explain a syntactical problem, a particular construction, or the derivation of a particular word or the like. The interesting thing about these grammatical analyses is that certain of the technical terms Buddhaghosa uses are without parallel in Sanskrit grammar. It is possible to show, how-

ever, that in substance the analyses found in Visuddhimagga and the Atṭhakathās presuppose Pāṇinian grammar. Consequently there is no reason to assume with R.O. Franke ${ }^{39}$ that these terms constitute the vocabulary of an old Pāli grammatical system used by the compiler(s) of the Atṭhakathās. ${ }^{40}$ In fact, the rudimentary character of the vocabulary would seem to indicate that it was established for exegetical purposes, its nature being dictated by its relevance for the canonical exegesis and the wish to use a distinct Pāli terminology for this purpose, rather than with the intention of establishing a comprehensive Pāli grammatical system.
§ 7. The grammatical vocabulary that is specific to the Atṭhakathās is limited to (a) a peculiar phonological terminology, (b) a remarkable case terminology, (c) a term denoting the syntactical category of adverb, (d) terms denoting the four parts of speech, (e.a, e.b) two sets of terms defining four types of nominals, and (f) terms denoting words, sentences, and syllables.
(a) Certain of the phonological terms differ from Sanskrit terminology. They occur in a verse which is quoted and commented on at Sp I 399,198 ${ }^{41}$ where the question of correct articulation of the Pāli is discussed in the context of the kammavācā. Among the individual technical terms sithila "unaspirated", dhanita "aspirated", niggahīta "nasalized", and vimutta "oral", are without parallel in Sanskrit terminology; dīrgharassa "long and short", garuka "heavy" and lahuka "short", however, are common to Pāli and Sanskrit grammar, whereas sambaddha "bound together" and vavatthitaṃ "separated" merely relate to the connected or disjoint articulation of the words in a sentence. The term

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{39}$ See $P G L: 2 ; 20$.
    ${ }^{40}$ See Pind I989: 33ff.
    ${ }^{41}$ sithilaṃ dhanitaṃ ca dīgharassaṃ | garukaṃ lahukañ ca niggahītaṃ | ambaddhaṃ vavatthitaṃ vimuttaṃ | dasadhā vyañjanabuddhiyā pabhedo ti (= Sv I77,I-4 = Mp II 289,17-20). For a study of this interesting passage, see von Hinüber, 1987.
niggahīta, which denotes a nasalized vowel articulated by checking the organs of articulation (karañāni) and without opening the mouth (avivaṭena mukhena), has been adopted by Kacc and post-Kaccāyana grammarians as a technical term equivalent to Sanskrit anusvāra. The grammarians, however, differ in their interpretation of niggahīta. Vajirabuddhi, the author of Mmd, interprets the term as (saraṃ) nissāya gayhati, i.e., grasped by means of a vowel. ${ }^{42}$ Buddhappiya propounds the same view, but in addition he reproduces the definition of the Aṭthakathā, quoting a verse at Rūp $\mathrm{IO}^{43}$ which defines niggahīta in such a way as to suggest that it is a versification of the definition at Sp . In contrast to Vajirabuddhi he also refers to sithila, dhvanita and the other terms at Rūp I ( $=$ Kacc I), ${ }^{44}$ thus evidently interpreting the remarks at Kacc-v I about akkharavipatti, i.e., failure to articulate the letters correctly, in terms of the kammavācā, which in the final analysis may have been the raison d'être of Kacc I ; ${ }^{45}$ moreover, he uses sithila and dhanita at Rūp i i. ${ }^{46}$ Aggavaṃsa appears to be the first Pāli grammarian who has integrated all the terms into his grammar. ${ }^{47}$

    ${ }^{47}$ See Sadd $\S \S$ I4-2 I.
(b) The Pāli Atṭhakathās use the following set of terms to denote the individual case forms: ${ }^{48}$ nom. paccatta, acc. upayoga, instr. karana, dat. sampadāna, abl. nissakka, gen. sāmi, loc. bhumma, voc. ālapana. The term ālapana is the only one that has canonical status: it is used in the Vinaya ${ }^{49}$ to denote the voc., and as such it has been adopted by the grammarians since Kacc, although they also use the term āmantana (see $\S 70$ ) in the same sense. As for the remaining terms they consist mainly of terms that are either innovations based upon canonical Pāli or terms derived from Sanskrit grammatical terminology. Thus the use of paccatta to denote the nom. is no doubt motivated by the semantics of Pāli paccattam (Skt pratyātmaṃ), evoking the idea of the nom. as denoting any given thing individually, i.e., its character as such, and thus roughly corresponding to the concept of linga. The term for the abl., nissakka, is a verbal noun derived from nis + visak, "to move away" - evidently coined as a counterpart to Skt apadāna - and is only recorded in Pāli as a grammatical term. However, the term expressing the loc., bhumma (n.) < Skt bhaumya or bhūmya, the case that relates to place, is recorded both as an adjective and a noun in the Pāli canon. ${ }^{50}$ The remaining terms are related to Sanskrit terminology: karana (ts.) (cf. Pāṇ I 4:42), sampadāna < Skt sampradāna (cf. Pāṇ I 4:32); the use of sāmī < Skt svāmin to denote the gen. has a counterpart in the discussion in Mahā-bh on Pāṇ II 3:50, where the expression svāmitva is used of the gen. relation rajñah puruṣah. It is difficult to determine what motivated the use of the term for the acc., namely, upayoga, which means "use, utility" and hence "thing used" denoting what is useful from the perspective of the agent. There is no clear parallel in contemporary Sanskrit grammar. ${ }^{51}$ According to Aggavamsa (Sadd §632) the term ubbāhana is used in the sāsana to designate the

partitive gen. or loc. (Skt nirdhārana), but it has not been possible to trace it to any known Atṭhakathā or $t \bar{t} k \bar{a}$.
(c) The origin and exact meaning of the term bhāvanapumsaka, which denotes the adverb, is obscure; the most likely suggestion is that it denotes a term in the neuter (qualifying) an action (bhāva), alternatively it might denote an action noun (bhāva) in the neuter. In the discussion at Sadd $\S 590$, Aggavamsa observes that it is used in the sāsana, i.e., the Atṭhakathās, etc., as the equivalent of kiriyāvisesana $<$ Skt kriyāvisesana denoting the adverb in Skt grammar.
(d) The Atṭhakathās divide the parts of speech (padavibhāga) into four categories, namely, nāmapada, ākhyātapada, upasaggapada and nipātapada. Most of them reproduce this division with minor variations in connection with the exegesis of the well-known canonical stereotype evaṃ me sutaṃ, etc. Thus Sv 26,98f. (on D I I,4) identifies evaṃ as a nipātapada; me, etc., as nāmapada; pați (of the pp. pațipanno) as upasaggapada; and hoti as ākhyātapada. ${ }^{52}$ There is reason to believe that this vocabulary belongs historically with the other terms. They occur in a similar classification of the parts of speech in Mahā-bh, ${ }^{53}$ and may thus have been inspired by the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.
(e.a) This fourfold division of nominals is only found in Vism 209.29 from which it was copied verbatim at Sp 122,198f. The four types of nominals are I. āvatthika, referring to a specific state (in the existence of an entity) (< Skt āvasthika; cf. Buddhist Skt avasthā), e.g. vaccho, dammo, balivaddo; 2. lingika, referring to, based upon a characteristic mark (< Skt laingika), e.g. daṇ̣̄̄, chattī, sikhī; 3. nemittika, referring to, based upon an attribute (of a person) (< *naimittika, cf. Pāli nimitta), e.g. tevijjo, chaḷabhiñño; 4. adhiccasamuppanna, spontaneous ( $=$ yadicchika, cf. Skt yadrcchika) like proper nouns, e.g. Sirivaddhaka. The origin of this terminology is not known. It only occurs in a discussion of the word Bhagavat and therefore probably originated in an exegetical

context with the intention to establish a distinct Pāli vocabulary for this particular purpose. It would seem to combine features from Sanskrit sources and canonical Pāli.
(e.b) The same tendency comes through in the analogous division of names at As 390.29 quoted in Paṭis-a $306.23 \neq$ Moh I 10.36 . The terms are I. sāmaññanāma, a name given by general assent, e.g. Mahāsammato (cf. D III 93,11); 2. guṇanāma, a name expressing an attribute, e.g. Bhagavat; 3. kittināma, a name expressing honour, i.e., a proper noun given at the birth ceremony; 4. opapātikanāma, original name, i.e., a name that is unalterably the same in time and space: purimakappe pi cando etarahi pi cando yeva, As 391,13. The term guṇanāma is analogous to na-imittikanāma of the above list. However, except for the term opapātikanāma, which presumably imitates Skt autpattika, "original" — used, e.g. in Mīmāṃsā of the original relation (sambandha) between a word and its denotation ${ }^{54}$ - the remaining terms cannot be assigned to any known context. Although this peculiar terminology is hardly ever used, it seems to belong in the Aṭṭhakathā tradition because it is also found at Spk I 95,7-8.
(f) Sp 223,22-24 quotes a passage presumably from the Mahāatṭ̣hakathā, ${ }^{55}$ which defines a rule of conduct (sikkhāpada) in terms of the collection of words (nāmakāya), sentences (padakāya) and syllables (vyañjanakāya) constituting it: vuttam pi c' etaṃ: "sikkhāpadan (Vin III 21,16) ti yo tattha nāmakāyo, padakāyo, niruttikāyo, vyañjanakāyo $t i$ ". The true meaning of this terminology was clearly not understood by Sāriputta who interprets them at Sp-t II 33,23-25 as synonyms of nāma with reference to Dhs $\S$ I306. ${ }^{56}$ The terminology stems from Buddhist Skt literature and can be traced to Vaibhāṣika theories of language

# II.2. Grammatical Analysis in the Aṭṭhakathās 

§8. The most interesting grammatical analyses found in the Visuddhimagga and the Aṭṭhakathās are based upon Pāṇinian grammar. Their main interest is that they identify syntactical or other features of Pāli with similar features of the Sanskrit bhāṣā described by Pāṇini in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In spite of the importance of these grammatical observations, the Pāli grammarians were slow at absorbing them. Only some of the exegetical remarks about certain uses of the cases were incorporated into the literature (see IV.2.7). However, as the grammatical tradition developed, some of the analyses were adopted by the tradition. Thus, for instance, Buddhaghosa's analysis of the syntactical constraints on the tense of the verb when constructed with the sentence complements atthi nāma, kathaṃ hi nāma, and yatra hi nāma are only treated by Moggallāna and Aggavaṃsa (see § I3), and in both cases in a polemical context with special reference to its treatment in Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathās.
§9. Other interesting discussions were not noticed by the grammarians. Thus, for instance, the analysis at Sp 21 I.3-5 ${ }^{59}$ of pitāmaha as an adj. with elided taddhita suffix (= petāmaha $<$ Skt paitāmaha) presupposing Pāṇ IV $374+77$ : vidyāyonisaṃbandhebhyo vuñ, ${ }^{60}$ was never adopted by the grammarians. Nor did the analysis of the commonly used particle

§ io. Buddhaghosa's analysis at Vism 216,48: of a string of derivatives in ika occurring in the well-known canonical formula svākkhāto Bhagavatā dhammo sandiṭthiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūh $\bar{\imath} t{ }^{65}$ is one of the few which has left its mark on the grammatical literature. The derivation sandiṭthiyā jayatī ti sandiṭthiko is based upon Pān IV 4:2: tena dīvyate khanati jayati jitam; the alternative derivation sandiṭtham arahatī ti sandiṭthiko is indebted to Pān V I:63: tad arhati; this is also the case with the derivations ehi, passa imaṃ dhamman ti evaṃ pavattaṃ ehipassavidhiṃ arahatī ti ehipassiko and upanayanaṃ arahatī ti opanayiko, whereas the analysis of akāla presupposes Pān V I :I08: prakṛ̣̣te thañ. Of these derivations Buddhapiya and Moggallāna only quote those on sandiṭthika and ehipassika at Rūp $360^{66}$ and Mogg-v IV 29, respectively. Aggavaṃsa, on the other hand, quotes most of the analysis at Sadd $\S 764$ (\# Kacc $352,353){ }^{67}$

§ I I. Moggallāna and Aggavaṃsa are also the first grammarians to have taken notice at Mogg IV 74 and Sadd $\S 783$, respectively, of the derivation of kammaniya, kammañña. They rely presumably on the Pāli tikās for their information, but the analysis itself presupposing Pān IV 498 : tatra sādhu is already found in As. ${ }^{68}$
§ I2. As mentioned above Buddhaghosa describes the constraints of the complements atthi nāma, kathạ̣ hi nāma, and yatra hi nāma on the tense of the verb which almost invariably occurs in the Pāli in the future tense, when constructed with them. He deals with (a) atthi nāma + fut. in $\mathrm{Sp}(=\mathrm{Ps})$, and Mp , (b) kathạ̣ hi nāma + fut. in Sp , and (c) yatra hi nāma + fut. in Sv, Ps, and Spk.
(a) Buddhaghosa claims in two slightly different analyses at Sp 209,13-10,1 (= Ps III 297,145.) and Mp III 298,18-99,3 ${ }^{69}$ that the complement atthi nāma is constructed with the future tense according to whether the meaning is that something is not likely to take place, or is not to be tolerated. The analysis presupposes Pān III 3 (145+) 146: kiṃkilāstyartheṣu lṛt.
(b) Buddhaghosa states at $\mathrm{Sp} 288,12-15^{70}$ that the future is used in the sense of the past in a sentence introduced by kathạ̣ hi nāma. The analysis would seem to depend on Pān III 3 I43 (+ I42): vibhāṣā kathami lin ca. ${ }^{71}$ Sāriputta's commentary, however, shows that he identified the source with Pān III 3 I44: kiṃvṛtte liñlṛtạ̣. ${ }^{72}$

    ${ }^{71}$ Kās, for instance, allows on the interpretation of vibhāṣā the construction kathạ̣ nāma + fut. in the commentary ad loc.: kathaṃ nāma tatrabhavān vṛ̣alaṃ yājayiṣyati.

(c) Buddhaghosa addresses this complement twice in Sv, once each in Ps and Spk. In Sv 425,268f.: yatra hi nāmā ti acchariyatthe nipāto ... anussarissatī ti idaṃ yatrā iti nipātavasena anāgatavacanaṃ, and Ps III 327,16: yatra hi nāma vimhayatthe nipāto, he underlines that it is the construction with the particle yatra hi nāma when expressing wonder that entails future tense of the verb, whereas Sv 569,15ff.: yatrasaddayuttattā (so read) pan' etaṃ anāgatavasena vuttaṃ (cf. Sv-pṭ II 219,2022) and Spk I 209,4-5: yatrā ti nipātayogena pana anāgatavacanaṃ kataṃ, merely attribute the future to the particle yatra. These remarks can only allude to Pān III 3 (+ 147: yaccayatrayoh) I50: citrīkaraṇe ca: "the affixes denoted liñ (= optative) are used in construction with yacca and yatra also when the implied sense is wonder". In these cases, the Pāli invariably substitutes the future for Skt optative, but the syntactical constraint is the same.
§ 13. Moggallāna defines the syntactical constraints of these constructions at Mogg VI 3: nāme garahā-vimhayesu: "[the future occurs] in construction with the particle nāma to express reproach or wonder", quoting in the vutti the relevant examples from the canon. ${ }^{73}$ It is clearly written in opposition to Buddhaghosa because in the Pañjik $\bar{a}$ he criticizes him, claiming that it is only the presence of the particle nāma as such that entails future. ${ }^{74}$ Aggavaṃsa in turn criticizes Moggallāna's view in his own analysis of kathaṃ hi nāma at Sadd §893 on the grounds that it can be shown that nāma in itself has no restrictive force (niyama) on the tense of the verb. He thus appears to defend Buddhaghosa on linguistic grounds. ${ }^{75}$ It is notable, however, that he does not deal with the other two complements.

# III. Kaccāyana (Kacc) 

## III.I Authorship of Kacc

§ I4. Kacc undoubtedly represents the first attempt ever made at writing a Pāli grammar. ${ }^{76}$ Its author, or rather compilator(s) (see § I7), is not known. The fact that the Sinhalese tradition claims that Kacc is composed by Buddha's disciple Mahākaccāyana is rather an indication of a fundamental uncertainty as regards its origin and authorship. This tradition can be traced back to the Apadāna-atṭhakathā (Ap-a), the only work among the Aṭ̣hakathās and tikās which mentions and quotes Kacc. ${ }^{77}$ It is there claimed that Mahākaccāyana "expounded the three treatises Kaccāyanappakaraṇa, Mahānirutti-ppakaraṇa, and Nettippakaraṇa in the midst of the Saṅgha". ${ }^{78}$ It is not possible to determine when this tradition originated: it is taken for granted by Vajirabuddhi (tenth century A.D.), who quotes in Mmd a well-known canonical

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{76}$ The only quotation from the grammar attributed to Bodhisattamahāthera at Padasādhanatīkā 402,29-30 (Bhadanta-Bodhisattamahāthero "naravaravacanōpakārāni cattālis' akkharāni" ti āha), and the two quotations from the Māgadhisaddakalikā attributed to Sabbaguṇākara at Padasādhanatīkā 396,1-8 (vuttañ cācariya-Sabbagunākarena Māgadhikasaddakalikāyaṃ "suttaṃ vyākaraṇam ussuttābhidhānenādeyyattā, suttam eva vyākarnasarīraṃ saddavippatipattiyaṃ pavattā yaṃ suttaṃ vinā agathitapuppharāsimhi viya atthākhyāne karīyamāne yāva suttaṃ na dassitaṃ, tāvad anuppādeyaṃ vacanaṃ bhavati, tasmā kāraṇā ti attho lakkhiyalakkhaṇāni vyākaraṇaṃ añño ubhayāni samuditāni vyākaraṇaṃ nāmā ti Kaccāyano maññate iti") and Pādasādhanatīkā 403,1-2 (Sabbagunākaramahāthero "siddhakkamādādayo vaṇ̣̄ākkharā titālisā" ti āha), do not suggest that they are pre-Kacc grammars as assumed by Franke, Geschichte und Kritik, p. 2.
    ${ }^{77}$ Ap-a quotes Kacc 406 at Ap-a 102,16-24.
    ${ }^{78}$ Ap-a 491,17-21 (ad Ap 531): thero ... puna satthu santikam eva āgato attano pubbapatthanāvasena Kaccāyana-ppakaraṇaṃ, Mahānirutti-ppakaraṇaṃ, Netti-ppakaraṇan ti pakaranattayaṃ saṅghamajjhe byākāsi. In the study by James d'Alwis, An Introduction to Kachchāyana's Grammar of the Pāli Language, Colombo 1863, the author cites a passage from Kaccāyanavaṇnanā (Introduction: xxii) ascribing this passage to Mp-t where it is not found; nor has it been possible to trace the passage to Kacc-vaṇṇ.
statement concerning Kaccāyana in explanation of his authorship. ${ }^{79} \mathrm{~A}$ somewhat different account is found in Kacc-nidd according to which Kacc I: attho akkharasaññāto was enunciated by the Buddha on hearing a bhikkhu mispronouncing udayabbayaṃ as udakabakaṃ; ${ }^{80}$ it is subsequently put by Kaccāyana at the beginning of his grammar. The emphasis here is on the correctness of the pronunciation of Pāli, and thus ultimately on sandhi, the subject matter of the first chapter.

# III.2. The Title of Kacc 

§ 15. The question of the authorship of Kacc is not the only problem surrounding the grammar; the title is also a major problem. In general the work is quoted by the grammarians as Kaccāyana. Vajirabuddhi claims in his discussion of the title that the grammar is called Kaccāyana (n.) because it is the work of Mahākaccāyana, but then he adds that the grammar is also called Sandhikappa. He explains this by referring to a line of the introductory verse of the sandhi chapter: vakkhāmi ... susandhikappam: "I shall set forth ... the chapter on excellent sandhi." The reason is, he claims, that the title of the first chapter has been transferred to the grammar as a whole. The correctness of Vajirabuddhi's remarks is confirmed by the fact that the phrase sandhikappo niṭthito is found at the end of mss, ${ }^{81}$ whereas the title Kaccāyana is conspicuously absent. It is not possible to decide whether originally the introductory verse was an integral part of the sandhi chapter or whether it was added later on. However, Vajirabuddhi's remarks indicate that at least in the tradition they were considered to be

    ${ }^{80}$ For the cpd, see Dhp 113, 374; for the narrative, see Kacc-nidd 3,246; this narrative offers a striking parallel to the story that is narrated in the Vinaya of the Mūlasarvāstivādin about a certain monk mispronouncing the cpd udayavyayaṃ at Dhp 113 as udakabakaṃ; for a discussion of the Mūlasarvāstivādin story, see GDhp, Introduction: 45 ff .
    ${ }^{81}$ See Senart's ed. of Kacc and Kacc-v 338 : sandhikappo niṭthito.
Kaccāyana's own, otherwise it is difficult to explain why the work as a whole came to be known as Sandhikappa.

# III.3. The Date of Kacc 

§ 16. It is impossible to date Kacc with any degree of certainty, first of all because there is hardly any internal evidence that would give a clue as to when the work was compiled. Since the rule at Kacc 69: ādito ca o stating that after $\bar{a} d i$ is is substituted for the locative morpheme $s m i m$, only seems to apply to post-Buddhaghosa Pāli, ${ }^{82}$ this rule must have been composed at a time when this Sanskritism, ${ }^{83}$ which is recorded in the Vin-vn, ${ }^{84}$ had been well established, presumably in the sixthseventh centuries A.D. If it is true that Kacc presupposes the Kāśikā (seventh century A.D.) (see §28) it may have been composed in the eighth century A.D. This assumption would not seem to leave sufficient time for the comprehensive commentarial literature, namely, Kacc-v, Mahā-nir, Sudatta-nir, Nir-pit, Cūḷ-nir, and Mañj, to develop between the eighth and the tenth-eleventh century A.D., which is the approximate date of Mmd (see § Io8). Since Kacc-v sometimes misinterprets Kacc (see $\S 52$ ) it is reasonable to assume that it was composed at a time when the purport of certain rules was no longer clearly understood. Moreover Kacc-v presupposes the Kāśikā and thus presumably belongs to the eighth century A.D. (see $\S 49$ below). Consequently it is more likely that the approximate date of Kacc is the seventh century A.D.

## III.4. Composition of Kacc

§ 17. According to the account of Mmd, Kacc comprises four treatises (pakarañāni): 1. sandhippakaraṇa, 2. nāmappakaraṇa, 3. ākhyātappakaraṇa, 4. kibbidhānappakaraṇa, divided into twenty-three sections (paricchedā): five sandhiparicchedā, eight nāmaparicchedā, four ākhyātaparicchedā, six kibbidhānaparicchedā. ${ }^{85}$ The division of the

[^0]

    ${ }^{83}$ See von Hinüber, 1986, § 327.
    ${ }^{84}$ See $C P D$ s.v. ādo.
    ${ }^{85} \mathrm{Mmd} 5,22-24$.
standard text differs slightly: it consists of four main chapters (kappa $=$ pakarana), some of which are subdivided into sections and subchapters. Thus the nāmakappa is divided into five sections (kaṇda) and three sub-chapters: kārakakappa, samāsakappa, and taddhitakappa. ${ }^{86}$ This is also the case with the chapter on verbal derivatives, the kibbidhānakappa, of which the final section is called unādikappa. Mmd apparently presupposes the same division. ${ }^{87}$ We must assume that this division reflects the history of transmission of Kacc. At the time when Dhammasenāpati composed his Kārikā it was customary to divide Kacc into eight chapters as appears from Kārikā 49: sandhināmañ ca kārakam, samāsataddhitākhyātakitakañ ca uñādikaṃ.
§ 18. Assuming that the verse introducing the first chapter of Kacc is an integral part of it, the grammar as a whole is marked by a conspicuous lack of compositional coherence. Thus the second chapter (nāmakappa) has no introductory verse. This contrasts with chapters three (ākhyātakappa) and four (kibbidhānakappa), which are introduced by verses in different metres in the standard version of Kacc. Of these verses, Vajirabuddhi only knows those introducing chapter four: the prefatory verses of chapter three have been added later on. ${ }^{88}$ Unlike the other chapters, chapter three concludes with a verse in which the anonymous writer asks the learned readers to judge his attempt at making a short exposition of the verb for the sake of the (Buddha's) teaching; ${ }^{89}$ the

    89 sāsanattham samuddittham mayākhyātam samāsato || sakabuddhivisesena cintayantu vicakkhanā ||
verse is quoted and explained in Mmd. ${ }^{90}$ Such haphazard composition would indicate that Kacc is a compilation by various hands. ${ }^{91}$

# III.5. The Number of Suttas of Kacc 

§ 19. There is considerable uncertainty about the actual number of suttas constituting Kacc. Vajirabuddhi claims that Kacc consists of 710 suttas: suttāni ... dasādhikāni sattasatāni honti. ${ }^{92}$ He quotes and explains 708, of which he considers 34 to be interpolations. According to this account, 674 suttas are supposedly genuine. He relates that "stupid persons ${ }^{93}$ whose minds are confused by abridgements have interpolated some suttas here from Sudattakisivanirutti (see IV.2.3) and Mahānirutti (see IV.2.2), thinking that this sutta (i.e. Kacc 317) is deficient". And he adds that "they do not appear in an absolutely clean copy of the original book". ${ }^{94}$ In the light of this information it is somewhat surprising that he incorporates interpolations in his account. Thirty-three suttas are interpolated in the kāraka section: three between Kacc 285 and 286, 287 and 288, and 301 and 302; twenty-nine between Kacc 317 and 318; one between Kacc 320 and 321 (see §68). Vajirabuddhi also considers Kacc 245 to be an interpolation. ${ }^{95}$
§ 20. The standard text of Kacc upon which Kacc-v comments comprises 675 suttas in the Sinhalese and Siamese versions, and 673 in the Burmese version which omits Kacc 244-45 from the nāmakappa. ${ }^{96}$ This

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{90} \mathrm{Mmd} 407,18-19$.
    ${ }^{91}$ It is, of course, possible that the verses were added later on; but in that case it is difficult to understand why it was not done systematically. The unsystematic way in which they are added seems to indicate that Kacc is a compilation.
    ${ }^{92}$ See Mmd 5,28-29.
    ${ }^{93}$ Namely, the interpolators (suttapakkhepaka), see e.g. Mmd 264,34, 265,10.
    ${ }^{94}$ Mmd 243,20-23: evam hi sūyate sañkhepōpajanitavibbhantabuddhīhi mandehi ūnam idan ti maññamānehi Sudattakisivanirutti-Mahāniruttito kānici suttāni idha pakkhittānī ti. na ca tāni suparisuddhe purimapotthake sandissantī ti.
    ${ }^{95}$ See Mmd 197,38-39: na ... eso purimapāṭho.
    ${ }^{96}$ Probably influenced by Vajirabuddhi, who considers Kacc 244 to be unauthentic; see n. 83 .
deviation from the other versions is no doubt reflected in Dhammasenāpati's account according to which there are 51 suttas in the sandhi chap., 218 in the nāma chap., 35 in the kāraka chap., 28 in the samāsa chap., 62 in the taddhita chap., 118 in the $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ chap., 100 in the kit chap., and 50 in the unādi chap., ${ }^{97}$ in all 672 suttas. Three suttas are missing from the nāmakappa, which comprises 221 suttas in the Sinhalese version. No doubt Kacc 244-45 had already been omitted in those days, presumably on the basis of Vajirabuddhi's remark about Kacc 244. We are left to speculate, however, about the identity of the third missing sutta.

# III.6. Variant Readings of Kacc 

§ 21. There are hardly any recorded variants of individual suttas. The readings that Mmd presupposes differ only in a few cases from the standard text of Kacc, e.g. Kacc 356 reads: samūhatthe kaṃnā. Mmd and Kacc-nidd, however, presuppose the reading samūhatthe kaṃn $\bar{a}$ $c a .{ }^{98} \mathrm{Mmd}$ and the Burmese version omit $c a$ at Kacc 436. Rūp, on the other hand, reads $c a .{ }^{99}$ In fact, the often illogical use of the conjunction $c a$ is a major problem for the interpretation of Kacc. One cannot exclude the possibility that some of the problems arise from a badly transmitted version of the original. In the case of Kacc 501 the original reading dāssa dajjam which has survived in some manuscripts and editions ${ }^{100}$ was changed so as to conform to Kacc-v which reads an optional $v \bar{a}$ into

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{97}$ Dhammasenāpati: (suttagananavinicchaya) 50-52: sandhimhi ekapaññāsaṃ | nāmamhi dvisataṃ bhave || atthārasādhikañ c' eva | kārake pañcatā̄̄̄saṃ || samāse atthavīsañ ca | dvāsatthi taddhite mataṃ || atthārasasatā̄hyaāte | kite suttasataṃ bhave | unādimhi ca paññāsaṃ suttaṃ etaṃ pakāsitaṃ Kaccāyanena therena ||
    ${ }^{98}$ See Mmd 313,26: tipadam idaṃ, cf. Kacc-nidd ad loc.: cā ti samuccaye.
    ${ }^{99}$ See Mmd 359,18: dvipadam idaṃ (scil. suttaṃ); Kacc-nidd 218,30-35: katthaci potthake "bhuja ... pe ... atthesu cā" ti cakārasahitam pi atthi, evaṃ sati caggahanenā ti iminā sameti Rūpasiddhīyaṃ cakāro atthi; Nyāse pana n' atthi.
    ${ }^{100}$ See Mmd 394: "dāssa dajjaṃ" kimatthaṃ idaṃ (scil. suttaṃ).
the sutta: dā icc etassa dhātussa sabbassa dajjādeso hoti vā. Both Mmd and Rūp follow this interpretation. ${ }^{101}$ Thus Buddhapiya has substituted dādhātussa dajjaṃ vā (Rūp 493) for the original reading. This was later on substituted for Kacc 501 in some manuscripts. ${ }^{102}$ Burmese and some Sinhalese manuscripts read dādhātussa dajjaṃ which clearly is an edited version of Rūp $493 .{ }^{103}$

# III.7. Kacc and Jinavacana 

§ 22. The language which Kacc describes is, according to Kacc 50, Jinavacana, a term which is also used of the Buddha's sermons in Buddhaghosa's Aṭthakathās, in the essay devoted to the exegesis of the canonical phrase evaṃ me sutaṃ. ${ }^{104}$ Kacc does not refer to the language of the Buddha as Māgadhī. This tradition, which can be traced to Vism 441,306: and Vibh-a $387,246$; , is summarized by Buddhapiya in a verse in Rūp. ${ }^{105}$ However, grammarians before Buddhapiya may have used Māgadha of the language of the Buddha. Thus Śrī Rāhula quotes in Padasādhanaṭ̣̄kā two verses from Niruttisaṃvaṇnanā (= Mañj?) stating

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{101}$ See Mmd 394,16: dā icc etassa dhātussa dajjādeso hoti vikappenā ti ñāpanatthaṃ. tipadaṃ (sic) idaṃ. maṇ̣̄̄kagativasena "havipariyāyo lo vā" (Kacc 490) ti ito vāggahaṇam ihānuvattate.
    ${ }^{102}$ See E* and J. d'Alw. dādhatussa dajjaṃ vā (= Rūp 493), cf. Sadd § 1005: dāssa vā dajjo.
    ${ }^{103}$ This is, for example, the reading of $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{E}} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 2}$.
    ${ }^{104}$ See Sv $31.7=$ Ps I $7.16=$ Mp I 10,17; Vibh-a 388,10: Buddhavacana; Ap 606,6: Jinavākya.
    ${ }^{105}$ Quoted at Rūp 60 :
    sā Māgadhī mūlabhāsā narā yāy' ādikappikā
    brahmāno c' assutālāpā sambuddhā c' àpi bhāsare.
    This tradition is also reflected in an interesting Sanskrit verse which is quoted from an unknown source in Vism-sn 1037,37-38 explaining the term nirutti:
    niruktir māgadhī bhāṣā sā cārthān nāma saṃvṛtih
    keci dhvāna iti prāhur vijñaptyākārasaṃyutah.
    saṃvṛti = Pāli sammuti; for dhvāna and vijñapti, cf. vāgvijñapti.
that the Jina did not propound the Dhamma except in Māgadha. ${ }^{106}$ Moggallāna, as is well known, refers to his own grammar as Māgadhaṃ saddalakkhanam.

# III.8. Kacc and Writing 

§23. As appears from the description at Kacc io: pubbam adhothitaṃ assaraṃ sarena vijojaye, of how to isolate words within continuously written text, Kacc presupposes the graphic practice of writing the final consonant in a conjunct below the line. Vararuci's Prākṛtaprakāśa ${ }^{107}$ takes the same practice for granted.

## III.9. Kacc and the Letters of Pāli

§24. Kacc 2: akkharā p' ádayo ekacattālīsaṃ, enumerates 4I letters of the Pāli, although the rules only make use of 40 letters: Kacc does not use the letter $l(<d)$ which is represented by $l$, also $l h(<d h)$ by $l h$. Although most Kacc mss and editions are inconsistent as regards the representation of $l / l$ and $l h$, it is clear that Kacc did not count $l$ as a letter of Pāli, because Vajirabuddhi explicitly remarks at Mmd IO,38ff. that the author of the suttas (suttakāra) uses $l$ in place of $l$ : suttakāro pana tassa (scil. lakāra) ṭhāne lakāram eva paṭhati. dissati hi "yavamadanataralā c' āgamā" (Kacc 35), "dahassa do laṃ (Kacc 616) iccevamādīsu. ${ }^{108}$ It is thus possible to deduce that Kacc 2 was compiled at a time when the distinction between $l$ and $l$ was not preserved, and later on reformulated

[^0]

so as to correspond with the graphic practice of a later age. In those circumstances it is something of a paradox that the editors forgot to make the necessary changes to the relevant suttas so that the work as a whole would reflect the new orthography. It is an open question when this reformulation was made, but it is apparently an established fact by the time of the composition of Kacc-v. Other Pāli grammars, like Cūḷ-nir (see IV.2.5), evidently an old commentary on Kacc, and the grammar attributed to Bodhisattamahāthera, ${ }^{109}$ state that there are forty letters in Pāli, and thus reflect the old version of Kacc.
§ 25. Since the use of $l$ is no longer preserved in northern India after the fourth century A.D., ${ }^{110}$ whereas it is retained in southern India, it is difficult to explain why it is not used in Kacc if one assumes that it is a southern Indian or Sinhalese compilation. Since Kacc like Vararuci's Prākṛtaprakāśa uses $l$ to represent the phoneme $l$, it is possible that Kacc is not a Sinhalese or southern Indian compilation, but that it originated elsewhere.

# III.io. The Sanskrit Sources of Kacc 

§ 26. It is a well-known fact that Kacc is modelled on the Kātantra, a recast of Kaumāralāta, of which approximately 215 rules are reproduced in a more or less edited form in Kacc. In addition there are almost 300 suttas (including the overlap with Kātantra) that appear to be edited versions of Pāṇini sūtras. ${ }^{111}$ It is thus obvious that the anonymous compilator(s) of Kacc have attempted to amalgamate Kātantra and Pāṇinian grammar. There may have been other sources. Thus one cannot exclude the possibility that Kaumāralāta, which occasionally describes Buddhist Sanskrit under the heading of $\bar{a} r s e,{ }^{112}$ was known to the compilator(s) of Kacc. One also wonders why Kacc in a few cases

describes Prakritisms (see §39). Whatever the sources of Kacc may have been, the fact of the matter is that more than half the rules of Kacc are without obvious parallels in Sanskrit grammar, and in spite of occasional Sanskritisms, the grammar as a whole does not reflect Sanskrit usage and vocabulary.
§ 27. R.O. Franke has shown that several of the suttas that constitute the kāraka chapter presuppose Pāṇinian sūtras. ${ }^{113}$ This tendency is pervasive. There are, however, interesting examples of innovations where rules that evidently are based on Pāṇini sūtras have been reformulated so as to include instances that are not presupposed by Pāṇini, like, for example, Kacc 324: tathā dvande pāni-turiya-yogga-senañga-khudda-jantuka-vividha-viruddha-visabhāg'-atthādīnañ ca, which combines in one sutta Pāṇ II 4:2: dvandvaś ca prānitūryasenāngānām, 8: kṣudrajantavaḥ, and 9: yesaṃ ca virodhaḥ śāśvatikaḥ. However, the terms yogga ("to be yoked") and visabhāga ("different") are commonly used Pāli words that have been adopted from Pāli literature to describe compounds that are specific to Pāli like phālapācanam (Sn 77), yuganañgalam (Sn 77), and sīlapaññānam (M II 210), samathavipassanaṃ (A I 157,15), and vijjācaraṇam (Sv 268). ${ }^{114}$
§ 28. It is questionable whether Franke ${ }^{115}$ is correct in assuming that Kacc 302: gati-buddhi-bhuja-paṭha-hara-kara-sayādīnaṃ kārite vā, which combines Pāṇ I 4:52+53: gati-buddhi-pratyavasānārtha-śabdakarmākarmakānam aṇ̣̄artā sa ṇau, hṛkror anyatarasyām, would seem to be based upon the Kāśikā, on the grounds that Kacc follows the Kāśikā by substituting vibhuj and vipaṭh and v'say for the Pāṇinian pratyavasānārtha, śabdakarma, and akarmaka, respectively. However,

Kāś also mentions other verbs that belong to each of the three categories, ${ }^{116}$ so it remains uncertain if, in fact, Kacc presupposes Kāś.

# III.i i. Technical Terms of Kacc 

§ 29. Kacc uses a highly restricted number of technical terms. Some of them are evidently copied from the Pāli Atṭhakathās, like, for instance, niggahīta (see § 7 (a)) which denotes a nasalized vowel, e.g. at Kacc 8, 30, 37, 82, 379, but apparently also any given nasal, e.g. at 448,468 , 539. The phonological term viparīta is used at Kacc 79: tabbiparīt' upapade byañjane ca, 406: tesu vuddhi-lopāgama-vikāra-viparītādes $\bar{a}$ $c a$, and 519: kvaci dhātu-vibhatti-ppaccayānaṃ dīgha-viparītādesalopāgamā ca, to denote the phoneme $o<a v a$, as well as $u<o$. According to Vajirabuddhi viparīta is an old technical term for $o$ ( $<$ ava $)^{117}$ which Kacc 50: o avassa describes as a substitute for ava. On the other hand it is also used of $u<o$ before conjunct consonants. ${ }^{118}$ It is perhaps borrowed from $\square$ gveda prātisākhya XIV.i7 where it denotes the change of $r$ into $i$.
§ 30. The case terminology is partly identical with the one used in the Atṭhakathās. Kacc uses sampadāna to denote the dative at 278,295 , and 313; and sāmī to denote the gen. at 285 and 303; ālapana denotes the voc. at 57, 116, 153, and 287. However, instead of bhumma, Kacc uses okāsa to denote the locative at 280: yo 'dhāro taṃ okāsaṃ and 304: okāse sattamī. This has no parallel in Sanskrit grammar and the Atṭhakathās and is probably an innovation. It is uncertain what might have motivated its use. It is likely, however, that it is based upon canonical usage. Thus, for instance, okāsa is used in the Vinaya, e.g. at

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{116}$ The first category comprises, in the following order, vihhuj, viaś, viad, vikhād, and vihhaks; the second, adhi + vi, vipath.
    ${ }^{117}$ Mmd 338,35: viparīto nāma okārassa porānakasaññā.
    ${ }^{118}$ See Mmd 94.II-I4: tassa avasaddassa tassa okārassa viparīto hotī ti okārassa viparīto ti ukāro idha gahito, okāro hi dīgho tasmā tassa rassabhūto ukāro viparīto, tassa ca ūkārokāro. akārādīnam pi es' eva nayo.
Vin I 94.9, ${ }^{119}$ in the sense of place which is semantically parallel to the Atṭhakathā term bhumma (see §7 (b)). The remaining case terms are related to Skt: linga denotes the nom. at Kacc 286, kamma the acc. at Kacc 282 and 299, karana the instr. at Kacc 28I and 288, and apādāna the abl. at Kacc 273.
§31. Kacc has coined a set of algebraic terms denoting inflectional classes of nominals: jha denotes masculine stems in $i$ and $\bar{\imath}$ (Kacc 58), la masculine stems in $u$ and $\bar{u}(\operatorname{Kacc} 58)$; pa denotes fem. stems in $i, \bar{\imath}$ and $u, \bar{u}$ (Kacc 59); gha stands for fem. stems in $\bar{a}$ (Kacc 60), and ga denotes voc. sg. (Kacc 57).

# III.I2. The Descriptive Technique of Kacc 

§32. As one would expect, Kacc as a whole imitates the standard descriptive technique of the Kātantra. The substitution of an item or the final element of an item is expressed by gen. (X-nom. replaces Y-gen.), e.g. Kacc 48: kvaci pați patissa and Kacc 76: āvass' u vā. In a few cases substituend and substituendum are simply juxtaposed in the nom., e.g. at Kacc 44: abbho abhi. Phonemic or morphophonemic changes are usually expressed by means of the acc. (X-nom. replaces Y-acc.), e.g. Kacc 21 : ivaṃno yaṃ na vā and Kacc 220: sesato lopam ga-si pi. In rare cases such changes are formulated by juxtaposition of the elements in question, e.g. at Kacc 470: thā tiṭtho. The loc. denotes operations applying to what precedes, e.g. Kacc 24: sare kvaci, the abl. denotes operations that apply to what follows, e.g. Kacc 452 : gahādito ppa-ṇhā.
§33. Although Kacc uses the descriptive technique of the Kātantra, the logical ordering and formulation of the suttas cause numerous problems of interpretation. Very often a problem is caused by non-standard use of the conjunction $c a$ or the disjunction $v \bar{a}$. Thus, for instance, the use of $c a$ at Kacc 20: do dhassa $c a$, is incomprehensible as the rule is without relation to Kacc 19: sabbo can ti. The technical use of $v \bar{a}$ is normally to express an option. However, at Kacc $13 v \bar{a}$ is apparently used as

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{119}$ umumhi okāse tiṭthāhi; for other references, see $C P D$ s.v. ${ }^{1}$ okāsa I.a.
equivalent with kvaci which occurs in the following rule. In fact, the two terms are apparently used interchangeably, thus making the exact scope of a rule difficult to interpret. For instance, the supposed option expressed by na vā at Kacc 2I: ivaṃno yaṃ na vā, is correctly interpreted by Rūp 2 I as synonymous with kvaci, ${ }^{120}$ in spite of Kacc-v which takes it as "optional", which clearly makes no sense in the context of the examples. In other cases $v \bar{a}$ appears to have no precise value at all, such as Kacc 28I: yena vā kayirate taṃ karaṇaṃ, which is modelled upon Kāt II 4:I2: yena kriyate tat karaṇam, and 285: yassa vā pariggaho taṃ sāmī. ${ }^{121}$ In the first case Kacc-v takes $v \bar{a}$ to mean "optionally" adding yena vā passati and yena vā sunāti to yena vā kayirate, but ignores the vā of Kacc 285.
§ 34. In some cases the suttas are inconsistent in the way they refer to the Pāli roots. For instance, v'gam is referred to in the form gamu (< Skt gaml, cf. Skt Dhāthup I IOI3) at Kacc 503, gami at 478, and gama at 546, 588, 598; and $\sqrt{ }$ dis ( $<$ Skt $d r s$ s) also occurs in the form $\sqrt{ }$ dus at Kacc 644 .

# III.I3. Kacc and the Description of Pāli III.I3.I. The Grammatical Rules of Kacc 

§ 35. Considering the modest scope of Kacc it is surprising how many linguistic features of Pāli it describes. The sandhi chapter deals with the main junctional features of the language, even a comparatively rare instance of sandhi like, e.g. the one described at Kacc 17: yaṃ edantass' ādeso, stating that "[in some cases] $y$ is substituted for final $e^{\prime \prime}$. Kacc-v illustrates this rule by quoting two canonical examples: adhigato kho my āyaṃ dhammo (Vin I 4,33) and ty āhaṃ evaṃ vadeyyaṃ (M I I3,1). Sometimes a rule appears to describe features that, quite apart from the fact that they are misunderstood, hardly ever occur. Thus Kacc 36: kvaci o byañjane is supposed to describe the word atippago at D I 178,10, which is analysed atippag $+o+\mathrm{C}$, o being

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{120}$ navāsaddo kvacisaddapariyāyo.
    ${ }^{121}$ Senart has discussed most of the cases in his edition and translation.
interpreted as āgama. Kacc-v quotes parosahassam (sic) at S I 192,30 as another example.
§ 36. Most of the nominal and pronominal paradigms as well as the various case forms of the numerals have been dealt with in the nāmakappa; even forms that are comparatively rare are recorded. Thus, for instance, the gen. pl. of the numeral ti viz. tinṇannam is described at Kacc 87: innaṃ iṇnannaṃ tīhi saṃkhyāhi. Only I I canonical instances of this form have been recorded. ${ }^{122}$ It is therefore surprising that another rare canonical form like tissannam, fem. pl. of $t i$, is not described. In the chapter on verbs Kacc describes most of the inflectional classes including present stems in $e$ at Kacc 512 (lopañ c'ettaṃ akāro) and records at Kacc 501 (dā-dhātussa dajjaṃ vā) and 502 (vadassa vajjam) new present stems like dajja and vajja. A rule like Kacc 472 : ñāssa jā-janan $\bar{a}$, stating that " $j \bar{a}$, jan, and $n \bar{a}$ are substituted for the root $\bar{n} \bar{a}$ " is surprising. Kacc-v quotes the form nāyati as an example of the substitute root $n \bar{a}$. Only two canonical examples of this form are recorded, namely, at Ja II 442,16 and Vin V 86,6. ${ }^{123}$
§ 37. It is remarkable that Kacc describes the Vinaya technical term āgantuka and its antonym gamika which are addressed in two consecutive rules at Kacc 571-72: āgamā tuko, bhabbe ika. The interesting point is that gamika (secondary $<$ gamin $+k a$ ?) is defined in accordance with the semantic value it has in the Vinaya where it denotes a bhikkhu who intends to leave to go somewhere else. ${ }^{124}$ It is semantically related to Skt gamin to which Pāṇ III 3:3 (bhavisyati gamyādayah) ascribes the same value. Although the context indicates that Kacc 572 is to be interpreted with reference to the semantical value of gamika, the awkward formulation of the rule avoiding any reference to the fact that $i k a$ is added to gam, perhaps indicates that it has been copied from another

[^0]

grammar in the context of which this was made clear. A possible model would be Kaumāralāta.

# III.13.2. Rules Describing Forms That Are Not Instantiated 

§ 38. Since the grammar to a large extent describes the language of the canon, it is somewhat of a paradox that Kacc occasionally formulates rules describing forms that are not instantiated. Thus, for instance, Kacc 42 (go sare puthass' āgamo kvaci) states that "in some cases the final $a$ of putha gets the augment $g$ before a vowel". The vutti quotes the example puthag eva which is recorded neither in the canon nor in the Atṭhakathās. It is difficult to believe, however, that Kacc describes occurrences that are not instantiated. Rūp quotes the following example in another context: ariyehi puthag evāyaṃ jano, ${ }^{123}$ which defines the term puthujjana in terms that are well known from Sv , although Sv uses puthu for puthag. ${ }^{126}$ This or similar examples may have been the raison d'être of this rule. The related rule Kacc 49: puthass' u byañjane " $u$ is substituted for final $a$ of putha before a consonant" evidently addresses forms like puthujjana $=$ Skt $p$ rthagjana. Like Kacc 42 it is only understandable on the assumption that the analysis putha $(g)$ or puthu ${ }^{\circ}<$ Skt prthag was known to the anonymous author of the sandhi chapter. Instances like these leave the impression that the notion of Jinavacana covers more than just the canon. The same observation also applies to the Sanskritism ādo loc. of $\bar{a} d i$ recorded at Kacc 69. This form is not found in Buddhaghosa's Atṭhakathās. According to Kacc 95: aggiss' ini, ini is substituted for the final $i$ of aggi $>$ aggini. The vutti quotes examples that are not recorded elsewhere.
§ 39. A few rules describe Prakritisms that are not attested in the extant literature. Kacc 452: gahādito ppa-ṇh $\bar{a}$ states that "after the roots gah, etc., follow $p p$ and $n h$ ", and Kacc 49I : gahassa ghe ppe that "ghe is

substituted for gah before $p p^{\prime \prime} .{ }^{127}$ A similar rule is found in Vararuci's Prākṛtaprakāśa VII 58: graher gheppaḥ. ${ }^{128}$ Another Prakritism is described at Kacc 503: gamussa ghammaṃ (= Rūp $427 \neq$ Sadd § IOI3) ${ }^{129}$ teaching that $\sqrt{ }$ ghamm is substituted for $\sqrt{ }$ gam. ${ }^{130}$ Kacc 392 formulates the rule that $c u$ or $c o$ is optionally substituted for catu in composition. The vutti quotes as examples the forms cuddasa, coddasa, catuddasa. Although the form cuddasa is attested in the canon (see PTC s.v.) there are no examples of coddasa. The latter, however, is common in Prakrit. ${ }^{131}$ It is uncertain how to interpret these isolated instances, but they indicate, together with the other examples, that the historical background of Kacc is extremely complicated.

# III.I3.3. Kacc and the grammatical Annotations of the Aṭthakathās 

§40. Although Kacc has borrowed a couple of its case designations from the Aṭthakathās, there is no clear indication that the work as such is written in the tradition of the Aṭthakathās. On the contrary, it seems to have been written more or less independently of the commentarial literature. For instance, the peculiar sutta Kacc 20: do dhassa ca, "and $d$ is substituted for $d h$ ", has apparently been composed, according to Kacc-v, with the sole intention of explaining the canonical phrase ekaṃ idāhaṃ ... samayaṃ at, e.g. M I 326,6, idāhaṃ being analysed as idha + ahaṃ, although Buddhaghosa interprets idāhaṃ at D I 91,II as idaṃ + ahaṃ, claiming that idaṃ is a mere particle (nipātamattaṃ). ${ }^{132}$ The interpretation of Kacc probably rests on a wrong identification of id $\bar{a}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{127}$ Rūp 503 and 505, Sadd §§93I and 98I, as well as Mogg V 179 (gahassa gheppo) mention it, without quoting instances from the literature.

(Vedic $i d \square$; cf. EWA s.v.) with idha which occurs in the expression idhāhaṃ, e.g. at M I I 2,30 and S III 2,14.
§ 4I. The kāraka chapter is to a large extent indebted to Kātantra and Pāṇini, although there are suttas that are not to be explained on the basis of Kātantra, Pāṇini, Mahā-bh, or the Kāśikā. In general the description of the case system does not appear to be influenced by the annotations in the Atṭhakathās, although there are cases where there are parallels between Kacc and the Atṭhakathās. Thus for instance Kacc 292: sattamyatthe ca, "and the instr. is used in the sense of the loc." appears to have been composed exclusively with a view of explaining canonical phrases like tena kālena (Ap 38,2), tena samayena (Vin I I,4), tena kho pana samayena (Vin I I5,1), as indicated by Kacc-v. This particular usage is commented upon by Buddhaghosa in a lengthy discussion at Sv 33,2ff., which concludes with a quotation from the old ones (porān $\bar{a}$ ) claiming that whether the reading is tasmiṃ samaye, tena samayena, or taṃ samayaṃ, the meaning is in each case locatival (sabbattha bhummaṃ eva attho). ${ }^{133}$
§ 42. There is also a parallel between the annotations of the Atṭhakathās and the sutta at Kacc 309: tatiyā-sattamīnañ ca, stating that "the acc. is also used in the sense of the instr. and the loc." The vutti cites as illustrations of the instrumental usage of the acc.: sace maṃ samaṇo Gotamo nálapissati, ${ }^{134}$ tvañ ca maṃ nábhibhāsasi (Ja VI 56I,20), and as examples of the locatival usage: pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā (Vin III 6,23), ekaṃ samayaṃ Bhagavā (D I I,4). The syntactical analysis underlying the first two examples is obscure and, quite apart from being wrong, is not supported by the Atṭhakathās. As in the case with the phrase tena samayena, Buddhaghosa comments on the Dīgha phrase at Sv 33,2ff., and he addresses the Vinaya phrase at Sp 177,8ff., where he

    ${ }^{134}$ This quotation is based upon S I 177,27-28: sace maṃ samaṇo Gotamo ālapissati ... no ce maṃ samaṇo Gotamo ālapissati.
analyses pubbanhasamayam as pubbanhasamaye, ${ }^{135}$ thus supporting the interpretation of Kacc and Kacc-v. However, the alternative explanation which analyses the term as pubbanthe samayam with reference to Pān II 3.5: kālādhvanor atyantasaṃyoge is not treated in Kacc-v on Kacc 300: kāladdhānaṃ accantasaṃyoge. There is therefore no clear indication that Kacc presupposes the grammatical observations of the Atṭhakathās.
§43. In other cases there is no detectable connection to the Atṭhakathās. Thus, for instance, Kacc 312 states that the loc. is used in the sense of the instr. This rule describes according to Kacc-v constructions like (naggā) hatthesu pindāya caranti (Vin I 90,11, 20; 91,1). Neither Sp nor Sp-t and Vmv address this usage. Since the Atṭhakathās occasionally interpret the loc. in the sense of the instr., ${ }^{136}$ one cannot, of course, exclude the possibility that the compilator of Kacc composed this sutta with reference to this type of annotations. On the other hand, since there is no clear indication that they were known to or considered by the author(s) of Kacc-v, it is not possible to decide with any degree of certainty whether the compilator(s) of Kacc actually relied on the Atṭhakathās. Another sutta - Kacc 308: kvaci dutiyā chatthīnaṃ atthe - states that "in some cases the acc. is used in the sense of the gen." Kacc-v illustrates this rule by quoting M I 240,29: api ssu mam Aggivessana tisso upamāyo ${ }^{137}$ patibhaṃsu. Buddhaghosa does not address this usage in Ps. Thus the general impression is that both Kacc and Kacc-v were composed independently of the Atṭhakathās. This conclusion would seem to be corroborated by the absence in Kacc and Kacc-v of important grammatical analyses found in the Atṭhakathās (cf. §§ 7-13).

# IV. Post-Kaccāyana Pāli Grammars and Commentaries IV.i. Kaccāyana-vutti (Kacc-v) 

## IV.i.i. The Authorship of Kacc-v

§ 44. Kacc-v is no doubt the oldest extant commentary on Kacc and therefore of particular importance for the history and development of Pāli grammar. Since post-Kacc Pāli grammarians never mention any, it is unlikely that there were other commentaries before it. ${ }^{138}$ The Sinhalese grammarians attribute Kacc-v to Saṅghanandin, whose name occurs only in this context. It is not possible to trace this tradition further back than Saddhammasaṅgaha ${ }^{139}$ (the end of the fourteenth century A.D.) ${ }^{140}$ and Śrī Rahula's Padasādhanaṭ̂kā (fifteenth century A.D.), ${ }^{141}$ but one cannot, of course, exclude the possibility that it is older. The Burmese tradition as reflected in Gv obviously regarded Mahākaccāyana as the author of both Kacc and Kacc-v. ${ }^{142}$ In general

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{138}$ The word mahāvutti is not the name of an old commentary (vutti) on Kacc as Franke assumed (Franke 1978, 335ff.). It is used of Kacc 406: tesu vuddhilopāgamavikāraviparītādesā ca, whose scope is so wide that it can be used to explain a large number of forms that are otherwise not accounted for by any Kacc sutta. This also explains why the sutta is referred to in the instrumental form mahāvuttinā or mahāvuttisuttena, i.e., in accordance with the sutta that has a wide application, but not in the loc. as is common practice. See Rūp-san 37,16-18: mahāvuttisuttena ... mahantesu visayesu pavattanato mahantī, mahantī vutti pavatti etissā ti mahāvutti, mahāvutti ca taṃ suttaṃ cā ti mahāvuttisuttaṃ. Buddhapiya refers to it as mahāvutti (at Rūp 30, 189, 371, and Rūp-( 146,18) or mahāvuttisutta (Rūp 34). Kacc-nidd 198,27 calls it mahāsutta. See also the term Mahāpadesasutta: mahāpadesasuttehi vā sarūpassa parasarassa lopo vutto ti daṭhabbaṃ, Sadd 43,26.

the Pāli grammarians refer to the author of Kacc-v as vuttikāra ${ }^{143}$ as opposed to the suttakāra.
§45. It is questionable whether Kacc-v as a whole is composed by the same person because the sandhi chapter differs from the other chapters in the way it paraphrases each sutta. In contrast to the other chapters which use the verb $\bar{a} p a j j a t e$ to indicate that a grammatical operation obtains, the sandhi chapter invariably uses pappoti, e.g. lopam pappoti or papponti at Kacc-v 12 through 17, contrasting with lopam āpajjate or āpajjante, e.g. at Kacc 220. They also differ with respect to the formulation of the contrastive sections of the exegesis of Kacc: in the sandhi chapter this section is invariably introduced by kasmā, elsewhere by kimattham. This difference in style seems to indicate that the commentary on the sandhi chapter has a different author from the rest of the work.

§ 46. Internal evidence indicates that the compilator(s) of the kāraka chapter of Kacc-v must have known the Kāśikā (seventh century A.D.), which therefore is the terminus post quem of this part of Kacc-v. In fact, part of the commentary on Pāṇ I 4:57: cādayo 'sattve, which defines the particles, has absurdly been added to Kacc-v 286 as an illustration of the meaning of the nom., which is defined at Kacc 286: lingatthe pathamā. After quoting examples of the use of nom. like puriso purisā eko dve, Kacc-v continues by adding the particles ca vā ha aha, etc., ${ }^{144}$ the order of which corresponds exactly to the order in which they are quoted in Kāśikā. The inclusion of particles as instances of lingattha is incomprehensible. If one assumes that Kacc-v as a whole was finalized after the seventh century A.D., it may belong to the first half of the eighth century A.D.

# IV.I.3. The Standard Versions of Kacc-v 

§ 47. The question of the authorship of Kacc-v is not crucial in the light of the fact that Mmd comments upon a version of Kacc-v which in many respects is markedly different from its present-day Sinhalese and Burmese versions (see IV.I.2). To complicate matters even more: they are mutually different. Thus the Burmese version differs from the Sinhalese not only with respect to the purely exegetical parts of the commentary, but also as regards the number, order and occasional analysis (viggaha, Skt vigraha) of the examples illustrating each rule. Even Sinhalese manuscripts differ among themselves. ${ }^{145}$
§ 48. The main cause of the complicated textual transmission of Kacc-v is that indigenous scholars read the text in the light of the comprehensive grammatical literature and commentarial literature devoted to the explication of Kacc and Kacc-v. In certain cases scholars would simply add a new paragraph to the explanation of any given sutta based upon the works of post-Kacc Păli grammarians. This has given rise to numerous interpolations that were added to the text at different periods of time during its transmission. All extant versions derive from the same archetype because they all share one scribal mistake: Kacc-v 35 quotes Ja II 316.22 with the reading vijjã instead of vijjãmayaṃ. ${ }^{146}$
§ 49. If one compares the version of Kacc-v on which Mmd depends with the one known to Chapaṭa, the author of Kacc-nidd, it becomes abundantly clear that already by the beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. Kacc-v had become inflated by massive interpolation. Chapaṭa mentions some of the sources, but he may not have been aware of all of them. Most of the interpolations consist of far-fetched interpretations of any given $c a$ of a sutta, which were added to the original text.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{145}$ These problems will be addressed in a new edition of Kacc and Kacc-v in preparation.
    ${ }^{146}$ The correct reading has been preserved in Sadd 6I8.23.
# IV.I.4. Reformulations of Kacc-v 

§50. In a few cases Mmd quotes readings that are not found in the standard Burmese and Sinhalese versions of Kacc-v. Thus, for instance, in the annotations on Kacc-v 4I, Mmd ${ }^{147}$ reproduces the following passage: tiṇnam vyañjanānam antare ye sarūpā tesam pi ādissa lopo hoti: "among three consonants [constituting a consonant cluster] the first of those that are identical is elided". In spite of the fact that this formulation is the only one that is meaningful in the context, the standard editions have different readings. Thus $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ reads tinnam pi byañjanānam antare sarūpānam kvaci lopo hoti. The same passage in $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}}$ (1904) reads: ca-saddaggahanena tinnam pi byañjanānam sarūpānam kvaci lopo hoti, whereas $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}}$ (1898) read tinnaṃ byañjanānam antare ye sarūpā tesam pi lopo hoti. An interesting quotation from Dāṭhānāga's Niruttisāramañjūsā in Subhūti's Nāmamāla ${ }^{148}$ shows that scholars differentiated between the original and the new reading (purimapātha and navapātha) of this passage. Except for minor discrepancies the old one is identical with $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}}$ (1898), whereas $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}}$ (1904) and $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ have adopted the new reading, except that $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ retains antare, thus apparently merging the old and the new one.
§ 51. Another interesting quotation which shows that the standard text has been edited is found at Mmd 440,19-20: "ekassa ekā hoti dasassa ca raso hotī" ti ādim āha, i.e., "ekā is substituted for eka and rasa is substituted for dasa". This has been reformulated in the standard versions of $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}}$ as ekassa ekā ${ }^{149}$ hoti dasassa ca dakārassa ro ādeso hoti: "ekā is substituted for eka and the phoneme $r$ is substituted for the phoneme $d$ of dasa".

# IV.I.5. Kacc-v as Interpreter of Kacc 

§ 52. The obscure formulation of certain rules in combination with the uncertainty caused by sandhi must have caused the compiler of Kacc-v many problems. In some cases it is questionable whether the interpretation reflects the intention of the original. Thus for instance Kacc-v 49 quotes both puthujjano (D I 3,32) and puthubhūtaṃ (D II 106,10) under Kacc 49 (see § 42) in spite of the fact that in the cpd puthubhūtaṃ puthu is $<$ Skt prthu. Another instance, according to Kacc-v 73 the sutta gāva se means that $\bar{a} v a$ is substituted for the final element of go before the gen. sg. ending. This indicates that the scholiast interpreted $g \bar{a} v a$ as $<g o$ $+\bar{a} v a$ meaning $\bar{a} v a$ is substituted for the vowel $o$ of go. Although the interpretation is sensible it is syntactically difficult to defend: the sutta can only mean gāva occurs before the termination of the gen. sg. viz. gāvassa. However, this form is not recorded in the canon, only gavassa occurs. This would indicate that the reading gāva might be a sandhi form $g o+$ ava $>$ gāva. On the other hand, the following suttas presuppose the morpheme $\bar{a} v a$. There is evidently no obvious solution to this problem. In one case it appears that the scholiasts have misinterpreted the sandhi form namh' āni at Kacc 647: akkose namh' $\bar{a} n i$, as namhi + $\bar{a} n i$. The suffix, however, is ani, cf. Pāṇ III 3 I12, of which Kacc 647 is a verbatim reproduction. ${ }^{150}$ The anonymous commentator also misinterprets Kacc 246, which has given rise to the ghost word tudampati (see § 87).
§53. Kacc-v often takes the opportunity to complement the rules of Kacc so as to enlarge their scope. In the majority of cases it is done on the interpretation of any given $c a$. For instance, Kacc 67: no ca dv'ādito namhi states that the numerals $d v i$, etc., take an additional $n$ (āgama) before the endings of gen. pl. Kacc-v adds on the interpretation of $c a$ an additional ssa, quoting two examples, one of which is canonical: catassannam itthīnaṃ and tissannaṃ vedanānaṃ (S V 21,23). There is only one recorded canonical example of the use of catassannam at

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{150}$ Both Rūp and Sadd follow Kacc-v on this point.
A II I54,33. Examples like this are not uncommon and indicate the wish to improve upon Kacc so that it describes more fully recorded usage. An interesting case is the annotation on Kacc 69: ādito o ca. The vuttikāra interprets this to mean that $m$ and $o$ are optionally substituted for the loc. morpheme of $\bar{a} d i$. The substitute $m$ is wrongly read into the rule from Kacc 68: am- $\bar{a}$ pato smin-smānam $v \bar{a}$. The example $\bar{a} d i m$ is certainly not to be interpreted as loc.; the other example, $\bar{a} d o$, is recorded. The interpretation may have been motivated by the concluding paragraph which, on the interpretaton of $c a$, claims that $\bar{a}, o$, and $m$ are used as substitutes for the loc. morpheme after other words; ${ }^{151}$ the examples are divā ca ratto ca haranti ye balim (Sn 223) and Bārānasim ahu ${ }^{152}$ rāj $\bar{a}$ (Ja V 68,28). The last example is interesting because the recorded reading is Bārānassam ah $\bar{u}$, not the problematic Bārānasim ahu ${ }^{153}$ which would seem to stem from a different manuscript tradition. However, the underlying intention of the exegesis is clear: it aims at complementing Kacc so as to bring its description in line with recorded usage.

# IV.I.6. Canonical and Non-canonical Quotations in Kacc-v 

§54. There are close to 200 canonical quotations in Kacc-v, which shows that the commentator(s) who compiled the vutti took pains to illustrate the rules by means of examples taken from the Pāli canon. So far it has been possible to identify approximately 23 quotations from Dīgha, 21 from Majjhima, 13 from Saṃyutta, io from Aṅguttara, and 34 from Vinaya. From the Khuddaka there are, not surprisingly, 44 quotations from Dhammapada, 15 from Suttanipāta, 6 from Khuddakakāṭha, 20 from the Jātaka, 2 from Udāna, 3 from Itivuttaka, and 3

    ${ }^{153}$ Ja V 68,28 reads Bārānassam (v.l. ${ }^{\circ}$ ṇasyaṃ) ah $\bar{u}$; cf. Sadd 204.135; Sadd 644,5: aññasmā ā ca: aññasmā saddato smin-vacanassa aṃ-o-ā-ādesā honti: ... Bārānasim ahū rājā (Ja V 68,28). vā ti kim? Bārānasyaṃ mahārāja (Ja II 435,14). Bārānasan ti pi pātho.
quotations from Apadāna. In addition, there is one quotation from Vibhanga, as well as a number of unidentifiable quotations from Pāli literature that must be considered lost. To these examples we may add all those instances - most of them canonical - where no context is quoted.
§55. Most of the quotations are found in the sandhi chapter and the kāraka chapter. Other illustrations occur unsystematically, which leaves the impression that they have been added more or less at random. Thus, for instance, Kacc-v 57 quotes bhoti Kharādiye (Ja I 160.3) ${ }^{154}$ as an example of voc. of fem. in $\bar{a}$, but omits quoting examples to illustrate the subequent rules, although this could easily have been done.
§56. What is particularly interesting about these quotations is the fact that they rarely deviate from the transmitted text of the canon. When they do, it raises the interesting question of which exemplars were used by the compilator(s). Thus, for instance, the quotation from M I 240.29 at Kacc-v 308: reads upamāyo for upamā of $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}{ }^{155} \mathrm{Kacc}-\mathrm{v} 312$ quotes Vin III 212.6 as an example of the use of the loc. in the sense of the direct object with the remarkable reading bhikkhūsu for $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ bhikkh $\bar{u} . \mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$, on the other hand, reads bhikkhūsu, so we must conclude that this reading was actually found in some manuscripts or that $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ was edited on the basis of Kacc-v. ${ }^{156}$
§ 57. Some of the examples were no doubt quoted from memory, which has caused slight distortions of the original. In most cases it is possible to identify the canonical source. Thus the quotation at Kacc-v i8: te

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{154} \mathrm{~B}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 2}$ and v.l. at $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}} K h a r^{\circ} ; \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 1}$ ghar ${ }^{\circ}$, cf. Kacc-nidd 26.34-35: bhoti gharādiye (sic) ti bhaginināmena ālapatī ti ekanipāte vuttam; Kacc-vaṇ̣ 78,29-30: gharādiye (sic) ti bhagini-ṃ-nāmenālapatī ti ekanipāta-atṭhakathāyaṃ (so read for ettha nipāta ${ }^{\circ}$ ) vuttaṃ; Ja I 160.6 reads: Kharādiye $\left(\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}\right.$ so) ti taṃ nāmena ālapati.
    ${ }^{155}$ Trenckner records the variant upamāyo and refers to Kacc-v at M I 550 (ad sutta 36 line 30 ).
    ${ }^{156}$ The reading is confirmed by all sources.
'nāgatā is probably based upon Vin V 221,14: te anāgatā honti, and the source of the quotation at Kacc-v 20: idh' eva maraṇaṃ bhavissati would seem to be Vin III 13,17: idh' eva me maraṇaṃ bhavissati. The two odd quotations at Kacc-v 27: sa ve muni jātibhayaṃ adassī and eso dhammo padissati are most probably distorted versions of Sn 209: sa ve munī jātikhayantadassī and Ja V 195,21: eso dhūmo padissati. The grammatically impossible quotation at Kacc-v 36 parosahassam bhikkhusataṃ is a distorted version of S I 192,30*: parosahassam bhikkhūnaṃ. ${ }^{157}$ The original of Kacc-v 38: ahaṃ eva nūna bālo must be Vin IV 331,14: ahaṃ eva nūna bālā, and the quotation dhammaṃ vo bhikkhave desissāmi at Kacc-v 147 is probably based upon Vin I 23,25: dhammaṃ vo desessāmi. The quotation sahāpi Gaggena sañgho uposathaṃ kareyya at Kacc-v 289 reads like a slightly edited version of Vin I 123,24: sañgho saha vā Gaggena vinā vā Gaggena uposathaṃ kareyya. The quotation sace maṃ samaṇo Gotamo nālapissati at Kacc-v 309 is based upon S I 177,27-28: sace maṃ samaṇo Gotamo ālapissati ... no ce maṃ samaṇo Gotamo ālapissati. In one case a wrong quotation is due to scribal error (see §47).

# IV.I.7. Interpolations in Kacc-v 

$\S 58$. The main source of interpolation is no doubt Mmd , from which the main part of the commentary on Kacc 330 has been taken, as well as his remarks on the interpretation of any given $c a$ or the like. Another important source is Rūp, but there are also other sources, some of which cannot be identified with any degree of certainty. ${ }^{158}$ In some cases, commentators were aware of the source of a particular interpolation and identified it. A few examples will suffice to show the character of such interpolations.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{157} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{cl}-2} \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ bhikkhusataṃ, $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ om., so also Rūp-v; Sadd § 130 substitutes bhikkhusañghaṃ (sic!); the readings bhikkhusataṃ and bhikkhusañghaṃ are grammatically impossible to construe.
    ${ }^{158}$ All interpolations in Kacc-v will be dealt with in a new edition of Kacc and Kacc-v in preparation.
§59. After the examples quoted at Kacc-v 182, C $^{\mathrm{cl}-2}$ (1898 and 1904) add casaddaggahanena abyaggamanaso naro (A I I30,1) ti ādisu manasaddato sissa okārādeso hoti. The source is Mmd 165,5-8. This interpretation is not in $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ (1974) or $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$, but very early on it had become part of the exegetical tradition as appears from Sadd, Kacc-nidd, and Kacc-vaṇn. ${ }^{159}$
§60. After the counter-example brahmā quoted at Kacc-v 198, $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{cl}-2}$ as well as $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ interpolate: uttaṃ iti bhāvaniddeso ( $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}{ }^{\mathrm{e}}$ ena) katthaci abhāvaṃ dasseti: brahmassa. The source is Rūp 123: uttam iti bhāvaniddeso katthaci abhāvadassanattho: brahmunā, brahmehi brahmebhi. $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ does not contain this interpolation. However, in the paragraph that follows the counter-examples at Kacc-v 200 all versions share the same interpolation: ārattaggahanena katthaci aniyamaṃ ( $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ w.r. ni ${ }^{\circ}$ ) dasseti: satthussa, pitussa, mātussa, bhātussa. The source is Rūp 159: ārattam iti bhāvaniddesena katthaci aniyamaṃ dasseti.
§ 6I. An example from Kacc-v 277 may illustrate the extent to which the text sometimes has been altered. The concluding paragraph interpreting ca reads: casaddaggahanena sesesv api ye mayā nōpadiṭth $\bar{a}$ apādānappayogik $\bar{a}$ te payogavicakkhaṇehi yojetabbā. Mmd neither quotes nor paraphrases this paragraph, and, moreover, interprets the use of ca otherwise: caggahanena aññathā pi pañcamīvibhattiñ ca chattthī-dutiyā-tatiyāvibhattiyo ca sañgaṇhāti. ${ }^{160}$ It is presumably an interpolation made by post-Buddhapiya grammarians, although it is difficult to trace the formulation to any particular grammar. Aggavaṃsa has written

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{159}$ See Kacc-nidd 70,14-17: idha caggahanena abyaggamanaso naro (see supra), Kassapassa vaco sutvā (Ja VI 227,5*) ti ettha sivacanassa ca aṃvacanassa ca okārādeso hoti; Kacc-vaṇn 180,4-8: abyaggamanaso naro (see supra), Kassapassa vaco (see supra) ty ādīni caggahanaphalāni; tattha ca abyaggamanasaddato simhi kate caggahanena siss' okāraṃ katvā sakārāgame kate rūpaṃ, Kassapassa vaco ti vacasaddato amhi kate caggahanena aṃvacanassa okāraṃ katvā sese kate rūpaṃ; for the second example, see Sadd 663,27 and $\S 377$ : aṃvacanass' o.

a similar paragraph at Sadd 708,23-24, not related to the interpretation of $c a$, but to $\bar{a} d i$ (sic): $\bar{a} d i s a d d e n a$ ye amhehi anupaditthā apādānappayogā te payogavicakkhanehi yojetabb $\bar{a}$. It is possible that the source of interpolation is Kacc-nidd, which, in addition, quotes the interpretations of Mmd and its $t \bar{t} k \bar{a} .{ }^{161}$
§62. Kacc-v 358 is an extreme instance of interpolation. It is possible to deduce from Mmd that the version of the commentary that was known to Vajirabuddhi must have read: tad assa tṭhānaṃ icc etasmiṃ atthe īya-ppaccayo hoti. madanassa ṭhānaṃ madanīyaṃ, bandhanassa ṭhānaṃ bandhanīyaṃ, mucchanassa ${ }^{162}$ ṭhānaṃ mucchanīyaṃ. ${ }^{163}$ evaṃ rajanīyaṃ, kamanīyaṃ. ${ }^{164}$ After the first paragraph $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 1}$ interpolate: dassanassa ṭhānaṃ dassanīyaṃ upādānassa ṭhānaṃ upādānīyaṃ; $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 2}$ dassanīyaṃ, upādanīyaṃ; $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ gamanīyaṃ, dussanīyaṃ, dassanīyaṃ. These interpolations are based upon Mmd 314,22-24: caggahanena hitādyatthe pi īya-ppaccayo hoti, tena upādānānaṃ hitā ti atthe idha caggahanena īya-ppaccaye kate upādānīyā ty ādīni sijjhanti. ${ }^{165}$

§63. Vajirabuddhi's annotation was, in turn, utilized by Aggavaṃsa at Sadd 789.29 (§774): upādānādito iyo hitatthādisu. However, the reading dussaniyam of $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}}$ would seem to be based upon Mogg-p ad Mogg IV 69. ${ }^{166}$ finally, the vutti in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{e} 1-2}$ concludes with the following interpolation: ca-saddaggahanena iya-ila-ppaccayā honti. rañño idaṃ ṭhānaṃ, rājiyaṃ, evaṃ rājilaṃ; the examples quoted in this paragraph are mentioned neither at Mmd nor at Rūp or Sadd 789.27ff.; the paragraph stems from Cūl-nir as indicated by Kacc-bh-nṭ ${ }^{167}$ : Cūlaniruttyādipakaraṇe tad assa ṭhānam īyo cā ti sutte casaddena ilaiyapaccayā hontī ti. It thus appears that Cūl-nir, in contrast to Mmd, for example, interpreted $c a$ so as to include the suffixes iya and ila which are not recorded in Pāli.
§64. In a few cases the anonymous editors of Kacc-v have copied verses from Rūp and the Bījākhyā and inserted them in the relevant section of the vutti. Thus all versions quote the following kārikā from Rūp: ${ }^{168}$
yo vadeti sa kattā ti yaṃ vuttam kamman ti vuccati
yo pațiggāhako tassa sampadānaṃ vijāniyā
It is not mentioned in Mmd, but it must have been interpolated before Chapaṭs's time because he quotes the beginning of it at Kacc-nidd

# IV.2. Post-Kaccāyana Pāli Grammars and Grammarians as Reflected in the Grammatical Literature 

## IV.2.1. The Question of Chronology

§65. The chronology of post-Kacc Pāli grammars, quite apart from the problems attached to Kacc-v, constitutes a serious problem which cannot be resolved satisfactorily: most of the literature is no longer extant and has to be studied on the basis of a few fragments quoted in Pāli grammars written at a later date. The following grammars are treated in the order suggested by internal evidence. Some of the works like the Saṅgaha, and the two sandhi treatises which Buddhapiya utilized, cannot be fitted into any relative chronology.

## IV.2.2. Mahānirutti (Mahā-nir)

§66. The Mahā-nir is, like Kacc and Nir-pit, attributed to Buddha's disciple Mahākaccāyana (see § I4). It is described in Mmd-pt (see § I I2) as a particular grammar of someone belonging to a different school (nikāyantaravāsin), ${ }^{171}$ which would indicate that it differs from the school of Kacc. However, since Cūḷ-nir comments on Kacc it may not be wrong to assume that Mahā-nir also comments upon it. Within the relative chronology the work belongs to the period after Kacc-v, whose existence it seems to presuppose, and it is thus datable to the second half of the eighth century A.D.
§67. It is possible to deduce from the limited number of references to and quotations from Mahā-nir in other Pāli grammars that the treatise

§68. Vajirabuddhi identifies Mahā-nir and Sudattakisivanirutti as two sources of interpolations made in Kacc (see § 18). The interpolated suttas show a marked dependence on Pānini. In a few cases they depend on the Kātantra, and a couple of suttas seem to presuppose knowledge of Kacc-v (see §69). Since it is not possible to distinguish between suttas from Mahā-nir and Sudattakisivanirutti they are quoted and identified in the context of Mahā-nir. All of the them except sutta 33 are interpolated in the kāraka section. As indicated by Mmd they must have been accompanied by a prose commentary:

§69. Aggavaṃsa has based a number of paragraphs in Sadd on these suttas, incorporating the relevant examples into them: sutta 8 is utilized for Sadd $\S 636$, sutta I I for Sadd $\S 638$, sutta 20 for Sadd $\S 604$, sutta 23 for Sadd $\S 638$, sutta 31 for Sadd $\S 670$, and sutta 32 for Sadd $\S 670$. Some of them are particularly interesting because they describe uses of the cases in Pāli which are also dealt with by the Sañgahakāra (see IV.2.7). Thus the examples that illustrate 24: "the locative in construction with v'gah, etc., is used in the sense of the acc.", namely (Bodhisattassa) muddhani ... cumbitvā (Ja VI 291,2-3, and (purisassa) nānābāhāsu gahetvā (M I 365,19), are also quoted in Mmd as illustrations of the view of the Sañgahakāra. ${ }^{175}$ Neither Kacc nor Kacc-v describes this usage. However, the examples that illustrate 25: "[the locative] is used in the sense of the instrument in the context of begging

for alms", viz. naggā hatthesu pindāaya caranti (Vin I 90,20), samanāa pattesu pindāaya caranti (...), are quoted at Kacc-v 312. Sutta 29: "the nominative is used in the sense of the accusative" is based upon a peculiar analysis of the well-known canonical phrase yena bhagavā ten' upasañkami. According to this, Bhagavā is used in the acc. because the underlying sentence structure is assumed to be yattha Bhagavantam adakkhi. ${ }^{176}$ This analysis is not supported by the Atṭhakathās.
§ 70. Buddhapiya concludes the kāraka chapter of Rūp by quoting a verse from Mahā-nir summarising the case terminology of the Atṭhakathās:

# paccattam upayogañ ca, karaṇaṃ sampadāniyaṃ. nissakkaṃ sāmivacanaṃ, bhummālapanam atthaman ti. ${ }^{177}$ 

Aggavaṃsa quotes it as a summary (uddāna) of a prose passage propounding the Niruttilakkhaṇa, i.e., the definition (of the cases) of the (Mahā)nirutti. This indicates that already at the time of the composition of Mahā-nir, grammarians attempted to integrate the terminology and grammatical tradition of the Atṭhakathās into their grammars. It is remarkable that the Niruttilakkhaṇa substitutes ämantana "the act of addressing, inviting" (Skt ämantraṇa ${ }^{178}$ ) for ālapana. ${ }^{179}$ The same term is used to denote the voc. in Rūp, presumably because it was used in Buddhapiya's main sources Mahā-nir, Cūḷ-nir, and Mañj. ${ }^{180}$ It may have been introduced from the Kātantra. ${ }^{181}$
§ 7I. According to Aggavaṃsa Mahā-nir differs from Kacc with respect to the definition of the tense ( $k \bar{a} l a$ ) of the verb which is described as

yan tikālaṃ tipurisaṃ kriyāvāci tikārakaṃ
atiliñgaṃ dvivacanaṃ tad ākhyātan ti vuccati. ${ }^{183}$
§ 72. Gv 70 mentions an abridgement of Mahā-nir called Mahāniruttisañkhepa about which nothing is known.

# IV.2.3. Sudattakisivanirutti (Sudatta-nir) 

§ 73. Mmd is the only Pāli grammar that mentions this treatise. Nothing is known about it except that certain scholars copied suttas from it and interpolated them in Kacc. Like Mahā-nir, the author of Mmd-pt considers it a particular grammar by someone belonging to a different school (see §66). It cannot be excluded, however, that it is a commentary on Kacc. Perhaps it is composed at the time of Mahā-nir.
§ 74. Formally it consisted of suttas and a commentary. Since it is not possible to separate the suttas of Sudatta-nir from those that have been copied from Mahā-nir, they have been treated together (see §68).

## IV.2.4. Niruttipiṭaka (Nir-piṭ)

§ 75. The Nir-piṭ is, like Mahā-nir, attributed to Mahākaccāyana. ${ }^{184}$ The way in which the work is quoted or referred to in grammars like Mogg and Sadd would indicate that it is composed after Mahā-nir. It is not possible to determine whether it is based upon Kacc or related to Kacc. Presumably it emulates Kacc and Kacc-v like Mahā-nir. One may tentatively date it to the first half of the ninth century A.D.

    ${ }^{183}$ The verse is identified at Rūp-san 298.09; cf. Sadd 50.00: "yan tikālan" ti vuttam ācariyehi, occurring in the context of a discussion of the views expressed in the Nirutti, i.e., Mahā-nir.
    ${ }^{184}$ See Sadd 168.245: Niruttiṭiṭakaṃ nāma pabhinnapaṭisambhidena mahākhīnāsavena Mahākaccāyanena katan ti loke pasiddhaṃ.
§ 76. It appears from the quotations in Sadd and Mogg that Nir-pit was composed in prose and kārikās.
§ 77. Like Cūḷ-nir (see IV.2.5), Nir-piṭ must have listed paradigms for all Pāli nominals because Aggavamsa often contrasts the various nominal and adjectival paradigms established in Nir-pit with those of Cūḷ-nir and Kacc. ${ }^{185}$ Thus, for instance, he mentions in the discussion of the paradigm of the present participle gacchaṃ $\cdot$ gacchanto, etc., that the Nir-piṭ claims that such forms as mahanto, etc., exclusively are used as nom. and voc. pl., and, moreover, that the Nir-pit establishes this after quoting a gāth $\bar{a}$ summarizing a series of such participles in the nom. sg.: mahaṃ bhavaṃ caraṃ tiṭtham. ${ }^{186}$ A similar gāth $\bar{a}$ is quoted in Rūp. ${ }^{187}$ It is likely that Nir-piṭ contained such verses enumerating a series of words belonging to a particular inflectional category. This is also the case with Rūp, which may have utilized Nir-piṭ for this purpose.
§ 78. In his discussion of the pronominal inflection, Moggallāna claims that Nir-piṭ authorizes the inflectional endings $\bar{a}, e$, and $\bar{a} y a$ in abl., loc., and dat., respectively, except in the case of the pronominal stems $t a$, eta, and ima. ${ }^{188}$ However, Mogg maintains that this exception is meaning-

less as it is contradicted by the canon, which he proves by quoting relevant examples. ${ }^{189}$
§ 79. Aggavamṣa quotes a couple of interesting passages from Nir-piṭ. One of them is the definition of the dvandva compound, ${ }^{190}$ which he must have used when reformulating Kacc 33I at Sadd § 709. The author of Nir-piṭ must have utilized Pāṇinian grammar for the description of the various types of dvandva compounds because Moggallāna reproduces at Mogg-v III 19 his definition showing dependence on Pāṇ II 4:2 foll. and Mahā-bh ad loc. ${ }^{191}$
§ 80. It is possible to deduce from another quotation in Sadd ${ }^{192}$ that Nir-piṭ like Cūḷ-nir contained a chapter on the Pāli nipātas: vuttaṃ hi Niruttipitake Nipātapadaparicchede: "tuṃ iti catutthiyā" ti. ${ }^{193}$ Rūp follows Nir-piṭ in this regard. ${ }^{194}$ Sadd has also preserved the def. of the verb: vuttam $h^{\prime}$ etam Niruttipitake "kiriyālakkhanam ākhyātikaṃ alingabhedam", which is related to the verse which both Mmd and Rūp quote from Mahā-nir (see § 7I). ${ }^{195}$

# IV.2.5. Cūḷanirutti (Cūḷ-nir) 

§82. The Burmese and Sinhalese grammarians attribute Cūḷ-nir to Yamakamahāthera. ${ }^{197}$ The treatise appears to be lost, but it is possible to form an idea of its nature through quotations and references to it in Mogg-p and Sadd. (Abhinava)-Cūḷanirutti which is still extant in manuscripts is apparently based upon Cūl-nir and may thus give an idea of its character. ${ }^{198}$ Cūl-nir was probably composed after Nir-pit (see §75) and may thus belong the second half of the ninth century A.D.
§83. It appears from the few identifiable quotations found scattered in post-Kaccāyana grammatical literature that Cūl-nir is a commentary on Kacc. Together with its commentary (vaṇnanā), the Mañjūsā (see IV.2.6), it is undoubtedly one of the most influential post-Kaccāyana Pāli grammars. Aggavaṃsa often refers to it together with Kacc and Nir-pit in the Padamālā, ${ }^{199}$ when discussing the nominal, pronominal, or other paradigms of the Pāli, occasionally contrasting its paradigms with those of Kacc and Nir-pit.
§84. It is somewhat confusing that quotations from it are often ascribed to the Nirutti, but it is possible to deduce from the information contained in later lit. that they must stem from Cūl-nir. Most of them are kārikās. Vijitāvī quotes in Kacc-vaṇn a verse from the Nirutti (= Cūl-nir) interpreting Kacc I4 followed by a few examples:

Aggavaṃsa has based Sadd § 35 on this interpretation and copied the examples. ${ }^{201}$ Vijitāvī also quotes a verse from the Nirutti interpreting Kacc 35. The verse adds on the interpretation of $c a$ sixteen additional consonantal āgamas to the eight defined at Kacc $35:^{202}$
yavamadādisuttena țthabyañjana-m-āgamo
casaddena pana sesā catuvīsati byañjanā. ${ }^{203}$
These āgamas are rejected as not instantiated in the Pāli. ${ }^{204}$ Although post-Kaccāyana grammarians regard them as fictions, we find them quoted in Saddasāratthajālinī 270.
§ 85. Moggallāna refers several times to Cūḷ-nir in Mogg-p. Thus his remark that the sandhi form yatha-r-iva $<$ yath $\bar{a}$ eva is found in the section on particles (nipāta) in the Cūḷ-nir, ${ }^{205}$ shows that, like Nir-piṭ, the work devoted a chapter to the description of the particles. This

tradition is followed by Rūp which quotes the same sandhi form in the chapter on particles, ${ }^{206}$ as well as later grammarians like Sadd and Pay, both of which are dependent on Rūp.
§ 86. Moggallāna mentions at Mogg-v II 52 the following two forms of voc. sg. of kañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$ : bhoti kaññe $\cdot$ bhoti kañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$. He justifies the form kañ $\bar{n} \bar{a}$ by referring to the fact that it is mentioned in the Nirutti ( $=$ Cūl-nir) although it is not described in Kacc. ${ }^{207}$ There is no reason to doubt that Nirutti in this case $=$ Cūl-nir because Aggavamsa quotes the same forms in Sadd referring to Cūl-nir. ${ }^{208}$
§87. In another context he criticizes the author of Kacc-v for permitting the unwarranted Sanskritism sugandhi, pointing out that it is found neither in the canon nor in the Nirutti. ${ }^{209}$ Moreover, he observes that the ghost word tudampati is not found as an example in the Nirutti, as is the case with Kacc-v 246 and other commentaries. ${ }^{210}$ In one case he has formulated his description of the suffixes la and iya at Mogg IV 58: tena datte l'-iyā, with reference to their definition in the Nirutti. In the discussion of this sutta at Mogg-p he quotes a fairly long passage from

§88. Both Rūp ${ }^{212}$ and $\mathrm{Sadd}^{213}$ quote a prose passage from Cūl-nir defining the nature of the verb: kālakārakapurisaparidīpikaṃ kriyālakkhaṇam ākhyātikaṃ. ${ }^{214}$ Sadd quotes another passage concerning the pronominal forms te-me, tava-mam, tuyhaṃ-mayhaṃ. ${ }^{215}$
§89. As mentioned above (see $\S 63$ ), unknown scholars have interpolated a passage in Kacc-v 358 based upon Cūl-nir.

# IV.2.6. Mañjūsā (Mañj) 

§90. Sinhalese grammarians attribute the commentary on Cūḷ-nir, Cūḷaniruttivaṇṇanā or Mañj, to a certain Patañjali. Gv 60, on the other hand, attributes it to an old ācariya (pubbācariya). The Mañj was known to Vajirabuddhi, who apparently elaborates the views of Patañjali concerning the reality of the kārakas in an interesting digression on Kacc 283 (see §93). ${ }^{216}$ It is thus reasonable to assume that Mañj was written in the ninth century A.D. It is regrettable that this interesting work appears to be lost ${ }^{217}$ because it has exerted a major influence on most Pāli grammarians who quote from it. In contrast to the majority of other Pāli

grammars, the Mañj is influenced by contemporary philosophy of language and apparently also by Buddhist philosophy. ${ }^{218}$
§91. The extant fragments show that Mañj was composed in the form of kārikās accompanied by explicating prose.
§92. Buddhapiya quotes several verses from the Mañj. Most of them occur in the chapter of Rūp devoted to the description of the kārakas. They show that Patañjali to some extent has based his description of Pāli's case grammar on Bhartṛhari's Trikaṇ̣̄̄ (TK). In fact, some of the verses are almost verbatim reproductions of the TK. Thus, for instance, the verse defining the apādāna kāraka is a version of TK III 7:136, except that it substitutes anumeyavisayañ ca for apeksitakriyaṃ ceti of TK :
niddiṭthavisayaṃ kiñci upāttavisayaṃ tathā
anumeyavisayañ cā ti apādānan tidhā mataṃ. ${ }^{219}$
Other verses substitute semantically equivalent Pāli terms for the terms used by Bhartṛhari, like, for instance, the verse defining the sampadāna kāraka, which is based upon VP III 7: 129:
anirākaraṇārādhanabbhanuññavasen' idha
sampadānaṃ tidhā vuttaṃ rukkhayācakabhikkhavo. ${ }^{220}$
§93. In the commentary on Rūp 288 (= Kacc 284) Buddhapiya quotes two verses stating that the domain of words is defined by convention (vohāravisaya) and is without ultimate reality (nekantaparamatthika); the denotation of a word is something imagined (buddhisaṃkappita) and thus also the syntactic relation, which therefore only has an imaginary existence (vijjamāno va). ${ }^{221}$ This argument is closely related to the ideas

# IV.2.7. Sañgaha (Sgh) 

§96. The author of this treatise is referred to as the Sañgahakāra (both in the sg. and pl.), perhaps in imitation of the name Sañgrahakāra known from Sanskrit grammar. The Sgh is only known from a few quotations in Vajirabuddhi's Mmd and Chapaṭa's Kacc-nidd. It is not possible to date the work with any degree of certainty. However, it must have been composed before the tenth century A.D., which is the approximate date of Mmd, and after Kacc-v, which it appears to know, thus perhaps between the eighth and tenth centuries A.D.
§97. The quotations show that the treatise is composed in the form of kārikās with an explicating prose commentary. Since they are confined to the kāraka chapter of Mmd and Kacc-nidd, there is reason to believe that the treatise is exclusively devoted to the description of Pāli's case syntax.
§98. Vajirabuddhi quotes in Mmd four prose passages from the Sañgaha. ${ }^{234}$ With the exception of the third one, the quotations are each

[^0]
[^0]:    232 stanakeiavatī strī syāl lomaśah puruṣah smṛtaḥ | ubhayor antaraṃ yac ca tadabhave napuṃsakam ||
    ${ }^{233}$ Mmd 239,13-14.
    ${ }^{234}$ See I. Mmd 240,28-29: (ad Kacc 285: liñgatthe paṭhamā) Sañgahakāro pana "liñgakattukammakaraṇasampadānasāmibhummadisāyogaālaṃanesu paṭhamā hotī" ti āha; 2. Mmd 243,54-58.: Sañgahakāro pana "karaṇakattukammapañcamīsattamyatthe nipātappayoge paṭikkhepe paccatte kucchitatthe itthambhūte kiriyāpavagge pubbasadīsasamānūnakalahanipuṇamissakasakhīlādiyoge hetvatthe kāladdhāne visesane maṇ̣̄tussake tatiyā hotī" ti āha; 3.

Mmd 255,5-8: Sañgahakāro pana "bhummathe sāmissarādhipatidāyādasakkhipatībhūpasutakusalesu niddhāranānādarakammakaraṇanimittasampadānāpadānapaccattopā-
followed by a large number of illustrative examples compiled by the Sangahakāra. Chapaṭa reproduces the second prose passage at Kacc-nidd 126,30-34 but in addition he quotes a verse whose subject matter is identical with the one formulated in the first prose passage quoted at Mmd 240,28-29. ${ }^{235}$
§ 99. The majority of the examples are quoted from unidentifiable postcanonical Pāli literature. However, there are also a number of interesting canonical quotations. In a few cases Mmd reproduces canonical quotations which are found in Kacc-v in a slightly edited version. Thus, for instance the Vinaya quotation at Kacc-v 312: hatthesu pindāaya caranti (Vin I 90,11) is quoted as naggā hatthesu pindāaya caranti (Vin I 90,20). ${ }^{236}$ The quotations show that the case terminology of the Sangaha is influenced by the terminology of the Aṭthakathās, which he must have utilized. Thus, for instance, he quotes D I 63,22-23: idam pi 'ssa hoti sīlasmin ti as an example of the use of the loc. in the sense of the nom. Since Buddhaghosa mentions in Sv that the Mahātṭhakathā interprets the loc. as the nom. (paccattavacanatthe ... etam bhummam), ${ }^{237}$ the interpretation is no doubt indebted to Sv.
§ 100. There are other examples of the Sangahakāra's use of the Pāli commentaries. For instance, he quotes Vin I 103,11: āvikatā hi 'ssa phāsu hoti, as an example of the use of the nom. in the sense of the instr. (sic). The exegesis that justifies this amazing statement is found in Kkh 26,25f.: āvikatā ti āvikatāya, pakāsitāyā ti attho; alajjitā ti ādisu viya
dhyadhikissaravacanamaṇditussukkakālabhāvesu sattamī vibhatti hotī" ti āha.
${ }^{235}$ Kacc-nidd I26,4-6: vuttañ ca Sañgahakārehi:
lingatthe kattukammatthe karaṇe sampadāniye nissakke sāmibhummatthe disatthālapane tathā
${ }^{236}$ Rāp 114,31 has the same reading, but Sadd 727,21 reproduces the reading of Kacc-v.
${ }^{237}$ Rāp 182,16 ff.
idam pi karaṇatthe paccattavacanaṃ. ${ }^{238}$ The interpretation of D II 230.2: ajjhāsayaṃ ādibrahmacariyaṃ in the sense of the instr. is based upon the gloss on this construction at Sv: karanatthe pacattavacanaṃ. ${ }^{239}$ It is thus clear that the Sañgahakāra attempted to integrate the grammatical annotations of the Aṭthakathās into his own work.
§ IOI. Aggavaṃsa composed Sadd §559: pathamatthe tatiyā-sattamiyo, and $\S 660$ : tatiyatthe pathamā, with particular regard to the above interpretation of D I 63.22-23 and D II 230.2. Though it cannot be excluded that he knew the Sgh, it is more likely that he copied the description from Mmd, of which he was a careful reader.

# IV.2.8. Mahāsandhi (Mahā-s) 

§ 102. Mahā-s is only referred to once in Buddhapiya's Rūp-t. ${ }^{240}$ In the remarks on the introductory verse of Rūp he mentions that he utilized the sandhi treatises, i.e., Mahā-s and Cūḷ-s (see IV.2.9). ${ }^{241}$
§ 103. The discussion in Rūp-t of the views expressed in Mahā-s shows that it was a revised version of the sandhi chapter of Kacc.
§ 104. It appears from Rūp-t that the author has interpolated a restrictive $t u$ in Kacc 29: vagge ghosāghosānaṃ tatiyapaṭhamā, so as to exclude the unwanted consequence of the imprecise formulation of the sutta that the voiced nasals belonging to each of the five groups (vagga) receive the third letter in the group of sonants as doubling. Buddhapiya rejects this interpolation on the grounds that since the thāne of Kacc 28 is the governing rule (adhikāra) such a problem does not arise. ${ }^{242}$

# IV.2.9. Cūḷasandhi (Cūḷ-s) 

§ 105. This anonymous treatise on sandhi is, like Mahāsandhi, only known from a couple of quotations in Rūp-t. Like Mahā-s Buddhapiya utilised it for the elaborate sandhi chapter of Rūp.
§ 106. Like Mahā-s the work appears to be an edited version of Kacc.
$\S$ 107. The discussion recorded in Rūp- ${ }^{243}$ shows that the author reformulated Kacc I I so as to read assaraṃ byañjanaṃ parakkharaṃ naye, excluding the word yutte on the grounds that the phoneme $m$ (niggahīta) is not a consonant. The other quotation states that "when a preceding [vowel] is elided, a following $i$ and $u$ become $e$ and $o$, respectively". ${ }^{244}$ This statement has probably been part of the elaboration of Kacc I4. Buddhapiya quotes it to justify his formulation of the comment on Rūp I6 (= Kacc I4). ${ }^{245}$

## IV.3. Extant Post-Kaccāyana Grammars and Commentaries IV.3.1. Mukahamattadīpanī (Mmd)

§ 108. Mmd or Nyāsa, also called Kaccāyanavuttivaṇnanā, ${ }^{246}$ is the oldest extant commentary on Kacc and Kacc-v. It is attributed to Vajirabuddhi ${ }^{247}$ or Vimalabuddhi who is also claimed to have composed

[^0]

    ${ }^{245}$ Rūp 7,13-14: ivaṇnabhūto ukārabhūto ca paro saro asarūpe pubbassare lutte kvaci asavaṇnaṃ pappoti.
    ${ }^{246}$ See Mogg-p 6,30: vuttaṃ Kaccāyanavuttivaṇnanāyaṃ (= Nyāsa, i.e., Mukhamattadīpanī, Mogg-pd I8,3I).
    ${ }^{247}$ Aggavaṃsa uses the name Vajirabuddhi in preference to Vimalabuddhi, e.g. at Sadd 210,4 .
a $t \bar{i} k \bar{a}$ on Abhidhammāvatāra. ${ }^{248}$ The date of Vajirabuddhi cannot be fixed with absolute certainty as Mmd contains no colophon containing a clue as to when it was composed. The work itself presupposes knowledge of Pāli grammars that are no longer extant. Vajirabuddhi mentions Sudattakisivanirutti (see IV.2.3) and Mahānirutti (see IV.2.2) from which he quotes a number of suttas interpolated in Kacc (see §68), and he quotes from the work of the Sañgahakāra (see IV.2.7). Internal evidence shows that he knows Patañjali's Mañjūsā (see IV.2.6). Since he quotes from an Abhidharma treatise ascribed to the $t \bar{i} k \bar{a} k \bar{a} r a,{ }^{249}$ whom the Mmd-pt ${ }^{250}$ identifies with Ānanda, the Mūlatīkākāra, who is traditionally placed in the eighth or ninth century A.D. (see DPPN s.v. I I. Ānanda), he is to be placed between the Mūlatīkākāra and Buddhapiya who refers to Kaccāyanavaṇnanā (= Nyāsa) in the introductory verse of Rūp ${ }^{251}$ and several times in Rūp-t. Rūp was written before Mogg and Mogg-p (second half of the twelfth century A.D.) because Mogg-p 6,23-24 quotes Rūp 3,25-26: kvaci saṃyogapubbā, ekārōkārā rassā iva vuccante. yathā: ettha, seyyo, ottho, sotthi. Mmd was thus probably composed in the tenth-eleventh centuries A.D. Because of its thoroughness Mmd has exerted a powerful influence on most Pāli grammars written in the tradition of Kacc.
§ Io9. Vajirabuddhi is a meticulous exegete of Kacc and Kacc-v, almost to the point of being pedantic. The general structure of each paragraph is that he first quotes and paraphrases each sutta, isolating and counting the number of words ( $p a d a$ ) that constitute it, a practice that was imitated by Chapaṭa and Vijitāvī in Kacc-nidd and Kacc-vaṇn, respectively. Then he comments on its interpretation in Kacc-v, carefully noticing if the author himself is going to add a paragraph on the interpretation of any given $c a$ or the like of Kacc. It is thus possible to deduce that if any

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{248}$ See SVD 1223 .
    ${ }^{249}$ Mmd 273,31.
    ${ }^{250}$ Mmd-pt 197,26.
    ${ }^{251}$ See Rūp-t 3,28: Kaccāyabyākaraṇañ ca tabbaṇnanābhūtaṃ Nyāsaṃ.
such paragraph is not mentioned, it has most probably been interpolated at a later date. Finally, Vajirabuddhi comments on the examples and counterexamples illustrating the sutta in question. In some cases he quotes short passages from Kacc-v, some of which differ from the transmitted versions (see IV.I.4). In addition, he makes an effort to distinguish between original and interpolated suttas in Kacc (see § I8). It is thus clear that Mmd is an invaluable source of information on the actual text of Kacc and Kacc-v at the time of the composition of Mmd.
§ ino. Mmd is in many ways an exegetical tour de force, whose main intention is to show how the individual suttas of Kacc and the explanations of the vutti in the final analysis can be derived by applying relevant rules from Kacc to the problem under discussion. Thus, for instance, in his comment on Kacc-v 44: abhi icc etassa sare pare abbhādeso hoti: " $a b b h$ is substituted for $a b h i$ before a following vowel", he explains that since the use of the word sare from Kacc 42 applies by way of recurrence (anuvattana $=$ Skt anuvrtti) and since the use of the word ādesa (substitute) is enunciated in the nominative, the substituend abhi is to be stated in the genitive, as the vuttikāra does. But then he continues by explaining that it is possible to take $a b h i$ as a genitive with elided genitive suffix on the interpretation of Kacc 221 (+220) stating that prefixes do not have any case markers. ${ }^{252}$ This, however, is an extreme case of commentarial ingenuity. On the other hand, Vajirabuddhi's exegetical practice shows that he regards Kacc as a synchronous system of rules from which it is possible to pick any rule that can be used to explain any given form.
§ i i . Usually Vajirabuddhi makes use of well-known exegetical devices, which he defines in connection with the exegesis of Kacc-v 48: pati etassa sare vā byañjane vā pare kvaci pați ādeso hoti: "before a following vowel or consonant pati is sometimes substituted for pati". Since the interpretation sare vā byañjane vā is not warranted by Kacc

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{252}$ Mmd 56.24-26: sareggahaṇassánuvattanato ādesaggahaṇassa paṭhamāya niddiṭthattā abhissā ti vattabbe abhisaddaṃ (so read) chaṭthiṃ katvā.
48 which only states that in some cases pati is substituted for pati, Vajirabuddhi takes the opportunity of explaining how certain governing rules either apply in the manner of a jumping frog (mandūkagatika, cf. Skt mandūkagati), i.e., from a preceding rule to the rule in question, or in the manner of the lion's gait (sīhagatika, cf. Skt simhāvalokitanyāya), i.e., from the immediately preceding rule to the rule in question. This makes it possible to explain the interpretation of the vuttikāra with reference to Kacc 42: go sare etc. (mandūakagativasena), and Kacc 49 puthass' u byañjane (sīhagativasena). ${ }^{253}$ It is, of course, questionable if this analysis represents the actual intention of the vuttikāra, but it illustrates the tendency of Mmd to exhaust every possibility of explaining Kacc-v as consistently based upon Kacc.

# IV.3.2. Mmd Commentaries and Grammars based upon Mmd 

§ 112. When Chapaṭa wrote Kacc-nidd, presumably in the first half of the fifteenth century A.D., several works related to Mmd were in circulation. Thus he quotes two passages from Nyāsatīkā, which are identical with passages in Mmd-pt, ${ }^{254}$ as well as Nyāsappadīpappakaraṇa, ${ }^{255}$ and Nyāsappadīpatīkā, ${ }^{256}$ of which a fragment is still extant. ${ }^{257}$
§ 113. Gv 63 attributes a Mahātīkā on Mmd to Vimalabuddhi (= Vajirabuddhi) which may be identical with Mmd-pt. Nothing is known about the authors of the other two works. Since they antedate Kacc-nidd, they may have been composed in the twelfth century A.D.

§ II4. Mukhamattasāra, ${ }^{258}$ "The Essence of Mmd", is attributed to Guṇasāgara who is also credited with a tik $\bar{a}$ on his work. ${ }^{259}$ It may have been composed in the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D. ${ }^{260}$ Chapaṭa quotes two verses from Mukhamattasāra ${ }^{261}$ which he notices are composed under the influence of Vimalabuddhi, ${ }^{262}$ as well as a prose passage. ${ }^{263}$ A late work like Vijitāvī's Kaccāyanavaṇṇanā (Kacc-vaṇṇ) (sixteenth century A.D.) is to a large extent an abbreviated recast of Mmd and should therefore be included among the grammars written in the tradition of Mmd.
