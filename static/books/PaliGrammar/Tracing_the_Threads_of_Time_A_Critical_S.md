## ABSTRACT

This research critically examines the evolution of the Pāli language and its literature, exploring historical contexts and scholarly interpretations that have shaped its development. Utilizing a qualitative library approach, data were collected from primary sources, including the Pāli Canon and its commentaries, as well as secondary sources such as research articles, journals, and scholarly books. The study reveals that Pāli, originally not designated as a language but as canonical texts, evolved over time to be recognized as the language of Theravāda Buddhist scriptures. The research highlights the significant role of Pāli literature, comprising the Canon (Tipiṭaka), commentaries (Atṭhakathā), subcommentaries (Ṭīkā), and other literary works (Pāli Pakaraṇas), in preserving and disseminating Buddhist teachings. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Pāli language's evolution and its literary corpus, offering valuable insights into the linguistic and cultural heritage of Theravāda Buddhism. The findings contribute to the academic understanding of Pāli's historical significance and its enduring impact on Buddhist scholarship and practice.

## Introduction

Pāli is a language of the Theravāda Buddhist scripture and is believed to be spoken by the Buddha. It was the common language among the general population. The Buddha used this language when teaching. The Buddha also allowed his disciples to learn his teaching in saka nirutti (his dialect). Pāli is generally regarded as the dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan. It is also known as Māgadhi and referred to as the mūlabhāsā. Though modern scholars may present diverse opinions concerning the home of Pāli, Theravāda tradition upholds the belief that the Pāli was Māgadhi.

Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero approved that in his commentary. In the early period, the word Pāli was not designated as a language but referred to the canonical texts. With time, however, Pāli came to be regarded as the language, which is the language used to write canonical texts as well as other Pāli literature. The word Pāli acquired a broader meaning, encompassing not only the texts but also the language of the texts. In short, Pāli literature encompasses the Canon (Pāli Tipitaka), commentary (Pāli Aṭthakathā), sub-commentary (Pāli Tīkā), and other Pāli literary works (Pāli Pakaraṇas).

Research on the Pāli language and its literature has been written by several researchers before. The results of these studies show that this Pāli language has two streams. First, the school says this Pāli language comes from the oldest Burmese manuscript. Meanwhile, the second is the Pāli language circulating today in both books and manuscripts in Ceylon, which condemns everything contrary to English (Mason, 1872). Pāli itself is the oldest language in India. Therefore, Pāli is also referred to as the language of the ordinary people and was used by Buddha for his teachings (Patil, 2021). So, it can be said that Pāli has an essential role in Buddhist history, just like Sanskrit literature (Rao, 2022).

Furthermore, other researchers also say that Pāli was a local language used by people in the state of Maghdha to communicate, later referred to as Maghdabhasa. When the Buddha was enlightened, he used this Pāli language to spread his teachings (Satiman, Koomkrong, \& Varindho, 2017). However, Pāli is not a language used today to communicate personal feelings. Therefore, Pāli has been recognized as a sophisticated, wise, and powerful medium for communicating the profound and subtle aspects of the Buddha's teachings (Perera, 2023).

From the description above, it can be said that many previous researchers have written research on the Pāli language and its literature. Therefore, this study aims to conduct further research on these existing studies to complete the scientific repertoire of the Pāli language and literature. This research focuses on the evolution of Pāli language and Pāli literature.

# Method 

The methodology employed in this research is qualitative research with a library approach. It is a series of activities that involve gathering literature data, reading, taking notes, and processing the research material (Zed, 2014). It involves acquiring information through resources offered by the library, including books, magazines, documents, and historical records, or conducting bibliographic research specifically relevant to the research topic (Mahmud, 2011). The data utilized in this research was gathered from both primary and secondary sources. The Pāli Canon and its commentaries are considered primary sources. Research articles, journals, and scholarly books are considered secondary sources. With this library approach, information relevant to the topic was gathered, analyzed, and come with conclusion.
# Findings 

## The Name of Pāli

In Canonical Texts and Pāli Commentaries, the term Pāli is not used to indicate a language. The original meaning of the term Pāli is a line, rowel, boundary, and limit. In its earliest usage, it was used to name a text. The Word Pāli always means the text, especially the texts of Buddhist scripture (Hazra, 2014). As found in the commentary and chronicles, Pāli has the meaning "canon." Culavañsa and Mahāvañsa reveal that the term Pāli is distinctly employed to refer to the original Buddhist text or Buddhist Canon, as opposed to explanatory commentary (pālimattam idhānītaṃ natthi atthakathā idaṃ) (Mhv. 227). In the Visuddhimagga it is said "Yasmā pana idaṃ cariyāvibhāvanavidhānaṃ sabbākārena neva pāliyaṃ na atṭhakathāyaṃ āgataṃ, kevalaṃ ācariyamatānusārena vuttaṃ, tasmā na sārato paccetabbaṃ," (Vsm. 107). In the Visuddhimagga too, it is stated "Imāni tāva pāliyaṃ āgatarūpāneva. Atṭhakathāyaṃ pana balarūpaṃ sambhavarūpaṃ jā̀tirūpaṃ rogarūpaṃ ekaccānaṃ matena middharūpanti evaṃ aññānipi rūpāni āharitvā." In addition, in the commentary of Puggalapaññtti, Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thera gives a similar distinction between Pāli and Atṭhakath $\bar{a}$ and a distinction between Atṭhakathā and Ācariyamata (Pañcapakaraṇa. 173) (Buddhadatta, 2014).

The word Pāli sometimes alternates with tanti. In the commentaries, the term Pāli came to be regarded as a synonym for Buddhavacana, Tipitaka, tanti, and pariyatti (Law, 2007). The term Pāli has been used for Canonical Texts, such as Parajika Pāli, Pacittiya Pāli, Mahavagga Pāli, Culavagga Pāli, and Parivara Pāli. However, by that time, the term Pāli has been regarded as a language of Pālibhāsā. The expression Pālibhāsā, meaning 'language of the texts,' was early taken to be the name of the language itself. In the seventeenth Century, the term Pāli was already being used as the language of Theravadin texts. In addition, in the Sāsanavañsa, written in Burma in 1861, the name Pāli is seen as a language (Norman, 1983). It is believed that Pāli arose from a spoken dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan, spoken in Magadha country and known as Magadhi. It is characterized as māgadhinirutti or māgadhi idiom was mūlabhāṣā.

## The Origin and Evolution of the Pāli Language

The Buddha was living around Magadha. Therefore, He used the language of Magadha, which is called Magadhi. Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero says that the language spoken by Buddha was Magadhi (Sammāsambuddhopi tepiṭakaṃ Buddhavacanaṃ tantiṃ āropento māgadhabhāsāya eva āropesi) (Samohavinodani. 388). This is referred to as the mūlabhāsā or the root of all the language (Sabbesaṃ mūlabhāsāya māgadhāya niruttiyā) (Mhv. 244). Pāli is sometimes called SuddhaMagadhi to distinguish it from Ardha-Magadhi, which the Jaina canon uses.

After his enlightenment, the Buddha preached his discovery of Dhamma to all people. The forty-five years of his life were spent preaching Dhamma to all of India. He preached to all beings regardless of caste or social status. He preached the truth to all beings to liberate them from the cycle of birth and death.

In India, there was a strata social system at that time. In addition, the usage of their language is different too. The low-caste people used Prākrit languages, while the high-caste people used Sanskrit in their communication. The people of high caste
considered Sanskrit to be a sacred language. Therefore, they did not allow the lowcaste people to speak Sanskrit. Only the Brahmins and the male community of royal families were allowed to communicate in Sanskrit. Pāli, a language belonging to Prakrit, is the language of ordinary people.

There were four periods of development in India's languages: Proto-IndoAryan, Old Indo-Aryan, Middle Indo-Aryan, and Modern Indo-Aryan. In the time of Old Indo-Aryan, languages were divided into two periods: Vedic Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, which originated from the earliest religious texts in India. This language was used by Vedic people or Brahmin, which was considered sacred and a language of high-class people. Classical Sanskrit was later developed. It is also known as Epic Sanskrit. However, Sanskrit is the language of high-class people. Therefore, the low-class people did not understand and could not study it.

In the period of Middle Indo-Aryan, the Pāli language has been developed. This language is called vernacular or can be used by everyone. Generally, people knew and understood this language. According to the orthodox theory, Pāli is Māgadhī, Māgadhanirutti, Māgadhikabhāṣā. Most of Buddha's time was spent in the Magadha, and Buddhism was developed there. Therefore, the Buddha used this language in his sermon to introduce Buddhism.

Many scholars believe that Buddha used the Magadhi language, although Magadhi changed over time. These changes resulted in a division into three forms, namely Māgadhī (the language of the court and cultured people), Addhamāgadhī (the language of the merchants and ordinary people), Suddha-Māgadhī (the pure Māgadhī, which came to be called Pāli, which was, as stated above the language in which the Buddha preached His doctrine, and in which the Buddhist Scriptures have been preserved).

Theravāda tradition holds Magadhi as the language of the Buddha. George Grierson, Windisch, and Winternitz support this view (Law, 2007). Different scholars have put forward their views regarding the origin and home of this language. T.W. Rhys David has said that Pāli was a literary dialect based on the spoken language of Kosala (David \& Stede, 2011). He said a standard Kosalan speech existed in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. The speech of the Buddha and the Pāli scriptures were composed within a century after the Buddha died in this Kosalan country (Law, 2007).
B.C.M Walleser said that Pāli was the language of Pāṭaliputta - the capital city of Magadha country. According to him, Pāli is contracted from Pāṭali or Pāḍali. W. Geiger regards Pāli as a keine based on Ārdhamāgadhī (Geiger, 2014). However, P. V. Bapat has shown in his research that it is not safe to prove that (Law, 2007).
E. Windisch and W. Geiger explain Magadhi as a language that was talked by the people in the region of the Middle Ganges (Geiger, 2014). H. Luder said that the language of the present Pāli Canonical Text is not the original form of that language. According to him, the original language in the $6^{\text {th }}$ Century B.C. was Ardha-Magadhi, which was the language of Jain Mahaweera. Due to the migration of Buddhist monks from Magadha to Western India, the teaching of the Buddha's language was also subjected to change. F. Edgerton, who composed the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary, expressed another view regarding the matter as he pointed out that neither the Buddha's home (Kapilavatthu) not his favorite place (Savatthi) not the
place of his first sermon (Banarasi) not the place of his death (Kusinara), belong to the Magadha country. Therefore, the Buddha is not likely to have spoken the Magadhi language in any of these places. Nevertheless, in this case, K.R Norman, a well-known Pāli scholar, suggests that it is more likely that the Buddha moderated his audience. Though the above scholars stated their views, it is difficult to investigate the actual linguistic situation in Magadha, India, during the 5th and 6th Century B.C. because the available records were written after at least a few centuries.

# Pāli Literature 

Pāli Literature is the whole treatise on Buddhism written in Pāli, including the primary and secondary sources of early and later texts. The Pāli Literature consists of four main divisions: Canon (Tipitaka), commentaries (Atṭthakathā), SubCommentaries (Tīkā), and other Pāli literary works (Pāli Pakaraṇas). Out of those four divisions, the original Buddha's words are grouped in the Pāli canon. At the same time, the other divisions contain more details to explain the Buddha's words. Those are composed of elderly monks from different periods.

## Pāli Tipitaka

Tipitaka is generally known as the Canonical Buddhist Scripture. The term 'tipitaka' has already been translated into various languages of various countries where Buddhism exists. Tipitaka is derived from two Pāli words: 'Ti' means 'Three' and 'Pitaka' means 'Basket.' Therefore, in English, it is known as Three Baskets. Various languages are given as Tripitaka (Sanskrit), Pitakaya (Sinhala), Pinyin (Chinese), Samjang (Korean), Tam tang (Vietnamese), Tiga Keranjang (Indonesian), etc.

Tipitaka consists of Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero tells us how tradition recognized the distinctive character of each pitaka. It is said that the Vinaya is the discourse on injunctions (ānā-desanā); the Sutta is the popular discourse (vohāra-desanā), while the Abhidhamma is the discourse on ultimate truths (paramattha-desanā) (DhsA. 21). In the Atthasālini, he tries to distinguish between Dhamma and Abhidhamma. Dhamma or sutta is a discursive "sappariyāya desanā" style that uses similes, metaphors, and anecdotes. In contrast, Abhidhamma is a non-discursive style, "nippariyāya desanā," which uses impersonal terminology, meaning, and functions (DhsA. 153) (Tīn, 2016).

Tipitaka consists of Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. According to the Theravāda tradition, Tipitaka Pāli is the primary source, and others are later compositions. The collection of Vinaya rules was grouped in the Vinaya Pitaka. The collection of discourses was named Sutta Pitaka. The collection of Higher Doctrines is named Abhidhamma Pitaka. According to the commentator, 84.000 Dhammakhandhas (units) are in Tipitaka. 82.000 units belong to the doctrines of the Buddha, and 2.000 units belong to the doctrines of Sāvaka Sangha and Councilors. It is classified further than 21.000 units belong to Vinaya Pitaka, 21.000 units belong to Sutta Pitaka, and 42.000 units belong to Abhidhamma Pitaka. The difference among them is that vinaya is the discourse on injunctions (ānā-desanā);
the sutta is the popular discourse (vohāra-desanā), while the Abhidhamma is the discourse on ultimate truths (paramattha-desanā) (DhsA. 21).

# Vinaya Piṭaka 

Vinaya Piṭaka is the first division of Tipitaka. It contains the monastic rules for monks and nuns. In addition, several discussions are regarded as the essential facts of Buddhism. It also records the situation of the Order after the death of the Master, including the story of the first and second Buddhist councils. Dhammasañgaṇi Atṭhakathā or Atthasālinī gives an account of the characteristics of Vinaya Piṭaka. It says that because it shows precepts and principles and governs both the body and the tongue, men call this Scripture of Vinaya. For so is vinaya is interpreted (vividhavisesanayattā, vinayanato ceva kāyavācānaṃ; Vinayatthavidūhi ayaṃ, vinayo vinayoti akkhāto) (DhsA. 19).

The Vinaya Piṭaka is considered crucial for the life of sāsana. It said that as long as the respect for law and Order is maintained so long shall the word of the Buddha prevail (vinayo nāma Buddhasāsanassa āyu vinaye thite sāsanam thitaṃ hoti) (VinA. I. 13). According to Theravāda tradition, Vinaya Piṭaka is made up of five books, namely: Pārājikapāli, Pācittiyapāli, Mahāvaggapāli, Cullavāggapāli, Parivārapāli. Pārājikapāli contains the basic rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, explained in the story. It deals with 4 Parajika, 13 Sañghadisesa, 2 Aniyata and 30 Nissaggiya Pacittiya. Pācittiyapāli contains the rules such as 92 Pacittiya, 4 Patidesaniya, 75 Sekhiya, 7 Adhikaranasamatha. Mahāvaggapāli reports several significant events, such as the Buddha's enlightenment and the Sangha's establishment. Cullavāggapāli elaborates on the bhikkhus' etiquette and duties, as well as the rules and procedures for addressing offenses that may be committed within the Sañgha. Parivārapāli contains a recapitulation of the previous sections, with summaries of the rules classified and re-classified in various ways for instructional purposes. It is the last book of the Vinaya Piṭaka and is a manual. It is compiled as a catechism, enabling the reader to analyze the Vinaya Piṭaka.

## Sutta Piṭaka

Etymologically, Sutta Piṭaka is derived from two words: Sutta + Piṭaka. Sutta means discourse, and Piṭaka means a basket. Therefore, Sutta Piṭaka is the basket of discourses. It contains many discourses which are subdivided into five Nikāyas, namely Dīgha Nikāya, Majjhima Nikāya, Saṃyutta Nikāya, Aniguttara Nikāya, and Khuddaka Nikāya.

Dīgha Nikāya is the first division of Sutta Piṭaka. It is a collection of long discourses. It consists of 34 long discourses (catuttiṃseva suttantā, tivaggo yassa sangaho; Esa dīghanikāyoti, paṭhamo anulomiko). Dīgha Nikāya is divided into three divisions, namely the division of morality (sīlakkhanda Vagga), the large division (mahā Vagga), and the division beginning with the discourse on Pāthika (pāthika Vagga). Sīlakkhanda Vagga contains thirteen discourses, Mahā Vagga contains ten discourses, and Pāṭika Vagga contains eleven discourses.

Majjhima Nikāya is the second division of Sutta Piṭaka. It is known as the Middle Length Discourses. According to the commentator, the name of Majjhima Nikāya because it contains middle-length discourses dealing with 152 Suttas. It is divided into three parts, namely Mūla Paṇnāsaka, containing 50 Suttas; Majjhima
Paṇnāsaka, containing 50 Suttas; and Upari Paṇnāsaka, containing 52 Suttas (dīyaḍ̣̣hasataṃ suttantā, dve ca suttāni yattha so; Nikāyo majjhimo pañcadasavaggapariggaho).

Saṃyutta Nikāya is a "grouped" or "connected" series of suttas in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is the third division of Sutta Piṭaka. In the European edition, the Nikāya contains 2889 suttas in all. However, according to the commentator Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero, there are 7762 suttas of varied length (satta suttasahassāni, satta suttasatāni ca; dvāsaṭthi ceva suttantā, eso saṃyuttasañgaho). Saṃyutta Nikāya is divided into five vaggas. A collection of vagga can be mentioned as one Saṃyutta. Those five vaggas are Sagātha Vagga, Nidāna Vagga, Khandha Vagga, Salāyatana Vagga, and Mahā Vagga.

Añguttara Nikāya is the fourth division of Sutta Piṭaka. It contains nine thousand fifty-seven Suttas and is divided into eleven parts (Nipāta) according to number of items of Dhamma covered in each sutta (nava suttasahassāni, pañca suttasatāni ca; Sattapaññāsa suttāni, sañkhyā añguttare ayaṃ). Those eleven parts (Nipāta) are Ekaka Nipāta, Duka Nipāta, Tika Nipāta, Catukka Nipāta, Pañcaka Nipāta, Chakka Nipāta, Sattaka Nipāta, Aṭṭhaka Nipāta, Navaka Nipāta, Dasaka Nipāta and Ekadasaka Nipāta (Warder, 1961).

Khuddaka Nikāya is the last division of Sutta Piṭaka. Khudda means smaller or lesser. Therefore, Khuddaka Nikāya is a division of short books. It contains fifteen discourses according to Sri Lankan tradition, such as Khuddakapāṭha (the short passages), Dhammapada (the path of the Dhamma), Udāna (exclamation), Itivuttaka (the truth-said), Suttanipāta (the sutta collection), Vimānavatthu (stories of celestial mansions), Petavatthu (stories of hungry ghosts), Theragātha (verses of elderly monks), Therīgātha (verses of elderly nuns), Jātaka (birth stories), Niddesa (exposition), Paṭisambhidāmagga (path of discrimination), Apadāna (stories), Buddhavaṃsa (history of the Buddha) dan Cariyāpiṭaka (basket of conduct). While according to Burmese traditions, there are 18 books with three additions, namely Nettipakarana (the guide to study Tipiṭaka), Milinda-pañha (Milinda questions), Petakopadesa (the instruction to study canonical) and Suttasangaha (compendium of discourses).

# Abhidhamma Piṭaka 

The word Abhidhamma is composed of two words: Abhi + Dhamma. Here, Abhi means higher, unique, further, etc. Dhamma means doctrine and philosophy. Therefore, Abhidhamma means the higher doctrine, particular doctrine, or the further analysis of Buddha's teachings. Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thera, the great Theravādin commentator, characterized Abhidhamma in the Atthasālini as the teaching that surpasses and distinguishes itself from the Dhamma (DhsA. 2). Additionally, it is explained that Abhidhamma is named because this teaching reveals things that undergo growth, possess proper attributes, well-differentiated and surpassing value (DhsA. 19) (Tin, 2016).

According to Theravāda tradition, canonical Abhidhamma is represented by seven books such as Dhammasañgaṇī (the Classification of Dhamma), Vibhangga (the Analysis), Dhatukathā (the Discourses on Elements), Puggalapaññatti (the Designation of Individual), Kathāvatthu (the Book of Debate), Yamaka (the Book of Pairs) and Paṭthāna (the Book of Conditional Relation).
Although those Abhidhamma texts are traditionally accepted to be the Buddha's own words, the historical authenticity of Abhidhamma as the words of the Buddha has been challenged by modern scholars. Historically, it is identified that the monk who compiled the Kathāvatthu was Mogaliputtatissa Thera at the end of the third Buddhist council, long after the parinibbāna of the Buddha (Medhācitto, 2023). The Thero argued in the Atthasālinī, saying that Ven. Mogaliputtatissa Thera expounded Kathāvatthuppakarana not by his knowledge but according to the table of contents laid down, as well as by the method given by the Buddha (Moggaliputtatissattheropi idaṃ pakaraṇam desento na attano ñāṇena desesi, satthārā pana dinnanayena ṭhapitamātikāya desesi). Therefore, according to tradition, all the books of Abhidhamma Piṭaka should be acknowledged as the word of the Buddha (DhsA. 6).

# Atṭhakathā (Commentary) 

The term 'Atṭ̣hakathā' is composed of the combination of 'atṭtha' and 'kathā'. 'Atṭtha' means 'meaning' or 'sense', and 'kathā' means 'talk,' 'discussion' or 'exposition.' Dīghaṭthakathā-ṭikā gives following observation 'attho kathīyati etāyāti atthakathā, sā eva aṭṭhakathā, ttha-kārassa tṭ̣ha-kāraṃ katvā ... (DAṬ. I. 19)' Toshiichi Endo suggests this translation 'The meaning is spoken by [means of] that is 'atṭthakathā; 'atthakathā' is also [spelt] 'atṭthakathā' when 'ttha-' is made into 'tṭtha' (Endo, 2013). Therefore, the whole term of Atṭhakathā means exposition of meanings. Generally, 'Atṭthakathā' is understood as the commentary of canonical sources (Tipiṭaka). However, Toshiichi Endo suggests that the Atṭhakathā includes not only the commentaries to the Tipitaka but also other works of diverse nature (Endo, 2013). Sodo Mori classifies Atṭhakathā into four categories:
a) Direct commentaries on the Tipitaka and the Visuddhimagga.
b) Primary commentaries such as the Nettippakaraṇatṭ̣hakathā, Catubhāṇavāraṭ̣thakathā, and Vinayasaṅgahaṭ̣thakathā.
c) Chronicles and native works such as the Dīpavaṃsa, Mahāvaṃsa, Sīhaṭavatthuppakaraṇa, and Sahassavatthuppakarana (Oldernberg, 1979). Some of these are occasionally named "-atṭhakathā," which indicates a text of the rank of atṭthakathā.
d) Specific works with no title of "-atṭhakathā" but with their commentaries labeled as "-ṭikā." They include, for example, some Abhidhammic summary works (e.g., Abhidhammāvatāra, Abhidhammatthasañgaha), some grammatical works (e.g., Abhidhānappadīpikā, Kaccāyanasāra), some poetical works or essay or poetry (e.g., Jinālañkāra, Vuttodaya). (Mori, 1984).

The Sāratthadīpanī-ṭīkā, sub-commentary to the Vinaya, gives different definitions of 'Atṭthakathā' in different way, such as 'the authority of the former teacher, which definition is seen everywhere in the Gaṇtipada-s' (pubbācariyānubhāvo atṭ̣hakathā ti sabbattha gaṇtipadesu vuttaṃ) (Be. I. 17). Vimativinodanī-ṭīkā defines atṭ̣hakathā as an exegesis free form the Tipiṭaka (atṭ̣hakathā ti pāḷimuttakavinicchayo) (Be. I. 124). Vinayālañkāra-ṭīkā suggests different definitions as any miscellaneous discourses preached or established by the Exalted One on different occasions (tattha tattha hi bhagavatā pavattitā pakiṇnakadesanā yeva atṭ̣hakathā ti) (Be. I. 12). Toshiichi Endo opines that these definitions may indicate that later Buddhists attempted to have even the
commentarial works authenticated as the word of the Buddha (Buddhavacana) (Endo, 2013).

Exegesis aims to elucidate the words and phrases that are difficult to understand. It is proved by its prologue with the phrase 'atthapakāsanatṭham' (for the elucidation of the meaning) (DA. I. 1). The Brahmajālasuttavaṇnanā shows six methods of exegetical methods. It states thus:
"Atha vā chahi ākārehi saṃvaṇnanā kātabbā sambandhato padato padavibhāgato padatthato anuyogato parihārato cāti." (DAṬ. I. 43).
'Sambandhato' means 'nidāna'; 'padato' means 'word-to-word explanation of extracts taken from the text'; 'padavibhāgato' means 'grammatical, philological and syntactical evaluation of words'; 'atthato' is 'correct interpretation of words and ideas'; 'anuyugato' means 'the method of raising questions or critically examining the validity of issues'; and 'parihārato' is 'the method of answering such questions or meeting the criticism with substantial counter-arguments' (De Silva, 1970).

According to Sri Lankan tradition, the Atṭhakathā were presumed to be composed at the First Buddhist Council and rehearsed at the following councils. It is reported that Atṭhakath $\bar{a}$ was introduced into Sri Lanka by Ven. Mahinda and also were translated into Sinhala by him. Though those translations are not available now, the names are mentioned in the Pāli commentaries and later works such as in the Vaṃsatthappakāsinī, Saddhammasañgaha, and the tīkā. The Sinhala Atṭhakathā are such as Mahā-atṭhakathā, Uttaravihāra-atṭhakathā, Mahāpaccariya-atṭhakathā, Kurundī-atṭ̣hakathā, etc.

However, this paper will deal with Atṭhakath $\bar{a}$ in the sense of the exegetical works or the commentary on Tipitaka. Pāli Atṭhakathā is to be dated from the first half of the fifth Century A.C. It is reported that Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero came to Sri Lanka during King Mahānāma's time (406-28 A.C.). Many Atṭhakathā were composed by him. Ven. Buddhadatta was another commentator and an elder contemporary of Thero. The most essential commentator after Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero was Ven. Dhammapāla. Furthermore, the commentaries were continued by other commentators, such as Ven. Upasena, Ven, Mahānāma.

The list of Pāli Atṭhakathā with their authors is given table 1 (Malalasekera, 1998).

# Tīkā (Sub-commentary) 

The word "ṭīk $\bar{a}$ " is derived from the root $\sqrt{ }$ tīk, which means to explain or to make clear (Jayawardhana, 1994). Tīkā is another kind of Pāli literature that is written to provide further elucidations or detailed information to the commentaries (Malalasekera, 2003). After commentaries were written, certain difficult words were not expressed clearly. Therefore, to elucidate further some problematic words found in the commentaries (atṭhakath $\bar{a}$ ), the sub-commentaries ( $t \bar{i} k \bar{a}$ ) were written. Pāli Tīkā is identified with the term "Atthavaṇnanā" (exposition of meaning). It is proved that on many occasions, instead of using the term Tīk $\bar{a}$, the author of the text used the term Atthavaṇnanā (D.T. I. 525). Prof. N. A. Jayawickrama points out that $t \bar{i} k \bar{a}$ are the dove-tailed into the commentarial period and flourished in the Polonnaruwa period and continued almost to the last Century (19 ${ }^{\text {th }}$ Century). They served as supplementary works to Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero's commentaries (Malalasekera, 2011).
The etymology of the word tīkā cannot be traced in Pāli. A definition is given in the Sanskrit book called "Sabdastomamahandhiya." The term tīkā is a feminine noun with the suffix "Ka." According to the Encyclopedia of Religion, the term tīk $\bar{a}$ is explained as that which explains the problematic word in the commentary. Taking everything into account, we can conclude that the term tīk $\bar{a}$ means to give interpretation to different words.

The Tīkā texts are divided into four categories. They are as follows:
a) Interpretation of difficult section in commentary (Linatthapakasini)
b) Interpretation of difficult section Pakaraṇa (Vinaya vinicchaya tīkā)
c) Interpretation of difficult sections in grammatical texts (Kaccayana vannana tīkā)
d) Interpretation of difficult sections in poetry with Alankara and meters (Vuttodaya tīkā and subodhalamkara tīkā)

Malalasekera stated that, unlike the commentaries, Tīkās were purely of Sri Lankan origin, compiled and written by Sri Lankan scholars (Malalasekera, 1958). They first started to compile in Sri Lanka and flourished during the Polonnaruwa period ( $12^{\text {th }}$ or $13^{\text {th }}$ centuries). There is not enough evidence to prove that Pāli Tīkās had been started to compose in India. However, exegetical works known as Tīkās are found in Indian literature. Tīkās are comparatively later compositions for beginners composed for any literature.

There are large numbers of Tīkā found in Buddhist literature. The exegetical works on the treatises such as Visuddhimagga and Abhidhammattasañgaha, etc., are also called Tīkā as evident from the names Visuddhimagga-Tīkā, Abhidhammattasañgaha, Vibhāvinī- Tīkā, etc. Further exegesis works like Mahāvaṃsa grammatical works like Bālāvatāra are also categorized as Tīkā.

Somapala Jayawardhana states eleven Tīkās, including one on the Visuddhimagga (Jayawardhana, 1994). The following table gives the names of Tīkās on the canonical texts, the names of canonical commentaries, and the author of Tīkās.

# Pakaraṇa (other Pāli literary works) 

Pakaraṇas is the last stage of Pāli literatures. It is also sometimes known as Compendium (Sangaha). This classification is viewed from one perspective because various scholars do more classifications to explain the content of Pāli Literature. Based on Sri Lankan tradition, some scholars add Post Canonical and Precommentarial Literature as the second stage. All literature or books were composed after the third Buddhist council (3rd Century BC) until the Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Thero wrote the commentary. He (5th century A.D.) was called Post Canonical and Pre-commentarial Literature. Nettippakarana, Petakopadesa, and Milindapañha, which, according to Burmese tradition, belong to Khuddaka Nikāya, Sutta Piṭaka, are included in Post Canonical and Pre-commentarial Literature according to Sri Lankan tradition. Chaṭṭha Sañgāyana Tipiṭaka broadly classified the Pāli Literature into four classifications: (1) Mūla: Pāli Canon, (2) Aṭṭhakathā: commentary, (3) Ṭ̄̄kā: subcommentary and (4) Añña: all remaining Pāli treatises. Therefore, all Pāli treatises not categorized as Canon, Commentaries, and Sub-commentaries are considered Pakaraṇa.

## Discussion

The research critically examines the evolution of the Pāli language and its literature, revealing that the term "Pāli" originally referred to canonical texts rather than a language. Over time, it became recognized as the language of Theravāda Buddhist scriptures. The study also categorizes Pāli literature into four main divisions: the Canon (Tipiṭaka), commentaries (Atṭhakathā), sub-commentaries (Ṭīkā), and other literary works (Pāli Pakaraṇas). This comprehensive categorization underscores the significance of Pāli in preserving the teachings of the Buddha and his disciples.

Comparing the findings with previous research highlights both similarities and differences. While scholars like George Grierson and K.R. Norman have discussed the origins and significance of Pāli, this study provides a more integrated understanding by combining historical, linguistic, and literary perspectives. Previous studies have debated the exact origin and classification of Pāli, often focusing on its linguistic aspects. This research, however, extends beyond linguistic analysis to include the broader cultural and religious context, emphasizing the role of Pāli literature in the preservation and dissemination of Buddhist teachings.

The findings of this research are indicative of the profound impact that language evolution has on cultural and religious preservation. The transition of Pāli from a mere designation of texts to a recognized language illustrates how linguistic developments can influence religious practices and cultural heritage. This evolution is a testament to the adaptability and resilience of religious traditions in maintaining their core teachings through changing times and contexts. The study of Pāli, therefore, reflects a larger phenomenon of how languages evolve and adapt to serve the needs of religious and cultural preservation.

The implications of these findings are significant for both linguistic and religious studies. For linguists, the study provides a comprehensive view of how a language can evolve from being a dialect to becoming a cornerstone of religious literature. For scholars of religion, the research highlights the importance of
language in preserving religious teachings and traditions. The categorization of Pāli literature into Canon, commentaries, sub-commentaries, and other literary works provides a structured framework for further research and understanding of Buddhist texts.

The research findings can be attributed to the extensive use of primary and secondary sources, providing a holistic view of the evolution of Pāli. The historical context, combined with linguistic and literary analysis, offers a deeper understanding of the development of Pāli. The consistency of Pāli's use in Theravāda traditions and its adaptation over time reflects the intentional efforts of Buddhist scholars and monks to preserve the teachings of the Buddha accurately.

Based on these findings, several actions are recommended. First, further research should be conducted to explore the phonological and syntactic changes in Pāli over time. Second, a comparative study of Pāli with other Prākrit languages could provide additional insights into its evolution. Third, incorporating modern linguistic techniques and technologies could enhance the understanding and preservation of Pāli texts. Finally, promoting the study of Pāli in academic and religious institutions can ensure that this critical aspect of Buddhist heritage continues to be preserved and understood by future generations.

# Conclusion 

This research has critically examined the evolution of the Pāli language and its literature, uncovering significant insights into its development. One of the key findings is that the term "Pāli" was initially used to denote the canonical texts rather than the language itself. Over time, however, Pāli came to be recognized as the language of the Theravāda Buddhist scriptures. The study also revealed that the Pāli literature is categorized into four main divisions: the Canon (Tipiṭaka), commentaries (Atṭhakathā), sub-commentaries (Ṭīkā), and other literary works (Pāli Pakaraṇas). These texts collectively preserve and elucidate the teachings of the Buddha and his disciples.

The primary contribution of this research lies in its comprehensive analysis of the historical and linguistic evolution of the Pāli language and its literature. By examining both primary and secondary sources, this study has provided a detailed understanding of how Pāli developed from a dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan into the established language of Theravāda Buddhist texts. This research enriches the academic discourse on Pāli by highlighting its role in the dissemination of Buddhist teachings and its significance in preserving the cultural heritage of Buddhism. The findings underscore the importance of Pāli as a scholarly and religious language, contributing to a deeper appreciation of its historical and cultural context.

Despite its comprehensive approach, this research has certain limitations. The study primarily relies on existing literature and historical texts, which may contain inherent biases and gaps. Additionally, the focus was predominantly on the textual evolution of Pāli, with less emphasis on its phonological and syntactic changes over time. Future research could address these limitations by incorporating linguistic analysis of Pāli's phonetic and syntactic developments. Further studies could also explore the influence of Pāli on contemporary Buddhist practices and its role in modern Theravāda communities. Expanding the geographical scope of the
research to include regions outside of South Asia where Pāli has had an impact could provide a more holistic understanding of its evolution and significance.
