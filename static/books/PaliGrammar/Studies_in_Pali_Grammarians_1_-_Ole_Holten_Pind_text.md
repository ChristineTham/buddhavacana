## Buddhaghosa's References to Grammar and Grammarians

## Introduction

It is not known when and under what circumstances a distinct Buddhist grammatical literature devoted to the description of the language of the Pāli canon originated. It is reasonable to assume that, throughout the development of the Buddhist tradition, basic knowledge of the morphology and vocabulary of the canonical language was handed down in some form or another, even though it may never have been based upon any distinct grammatical tradition. The Niddesa, with its strings of glosses and morphological substitute forms may be considered an early instance of the level of sophistication of such basic knowledge.

Strange as it may seem, there is no indication at all in the extant atṭhakathās and ṭikās that the commentators knew of any Pāli grammar prior to the well-known grammar ascribed to Kaccāyana. ${ }^{1}$ This would indicate that Kaccāyana's grammar may well have been the first recorded instance of a Pāli grammar. Although it is not known precisely when it was written, it is no doubt late. Perhaps it dates from the 7th-8th century A.D. since it is not referred to in any of the atṭhakathās except for Ap-a, a fairly late commentary. ${ }^{2}$ It is there ascribed to Kaccāyana along with the Mahānirutti and Nett. ${ }^{3}$
R.O. Franke, who devoted a study - to the best of my knowledge the only one in existence - to the history and criticism of the

indigenous Pāli grammar and lexicography, claimed that certain of the grammatical terms found in the commentaries ascribed to Buddhaghosa reflected an old Pāli grammatical system. ${ }^{4}$ This claim is questionable since the available evidence can hardly be said to justify the assumption of a full-fledged system of Pāli grammar before Kaccāyana. Apart from the fact that Buddhaghosa invariably uses a peculiar terminology for denoting the individual case relations, and that he uses the term bhāvanapumsaka ${ }^{5}$ to denote the adverb, there is hardly a single grammatical term of any importance found in Buddhaghosa's works that does not have a parallel in Sanskrit grammatical terminology.

Franke ${ }^{6}$ assumed that the following verse which is often quoted by the Pāli grammarians originally belonged to a Pāli grammar antedating Buddhaghosa:
paccattam upayogam ca karanam sampadāniyam nisakkam sāmivacanaṃ bhummaṃ ālapanaṭthamaṃ. ${ }^{7}$

[^0]On the contrary, according to Buddhapiya's Rüp- $\mathrm{t}^{8}$ it is quoted from the Mahānirutti which, from the available evidence, appears to be an old commentary on Kacc. ${ }^{9}$ The verse was probably conceived by the author of the Mahānirutti as a summary of the terminology used in the atthakathās.

There is therefore no reason to believe that the few grammatical terms that have no parallel in Sanskrit grammatical terminology reflect an old system of Pāli grammar. They probably represent part of a terminology that originated with the attempt to establish a canonical exegesis. Buddhaghosa and subsequent generations of Theravāda scholars no doubt continued to use this peculiar terminology because it had become an inseparable part of the Theravāda heritage.

An instance of such canonical exegesis is found in the verse that Buddhaghosa invariably quotes in connection with his interpretation of the canonical stereotypes "ekam samayam" and "tena samayena":
tam tam attham apekkhitvā bhummena karanena ca aññatra samayo vutto upayogena so idhā ti. ${ }^{10}$

With regard to this or that motive [the word] "samaya" is used elsewhere [in the Pāli] in the locative and the instrumental. In this context, however, it is used in the accusative.

[^1]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Cf. Franke, op. cit. pp. 3-5.
    ${ }^{5}$ This term is not mentioned among the terms quoted by Franke, op. cit. pp. 3-4. Aggavamsa has devoted a whole paragraph to it in the Saddaniti [cf. Sadd 717,15 foll.] because, as he says, it is the designation that is used in the scriptures (sāsane vohāro) in contrast to the term kiriyāvisesana [= sa. kriyāvisesana] which is used in grammar (saddasatthe). The meaning of this peculiar term is probably "a term in the neuter that qualifies a verbal action". The term bhāva is borrowed from Sanskrit grammar.
    ${ }^{6}$ Op. cit. p. 4.
    ${ }^{7}$ Cf. e.g. Rüp 116,20; Sadd 60,32. In the context of the case terminology it is interesting to note that the term for the vocative, ālapanam, is used in the same sense in the Niddesa section of the Vinaya [cf. Vin III 73,33]. Unfortunately we are not in a position to trace the other terms back to the canon. It therefore remains uncertain when and under what circumstances they came to be an integral part of the exegetical and grammatical terminology of the Pāli.

[^1]:    ${ }^{8}$ Cf. Rüp-t Be 1965 127,25.
    ${ }^{9}$ An analysis of the available fragments of Mahānirutti will be treated in Studies in the Pāli Grammarians II.
    ${ }^{10}$ Cf. Sv 33,27-28; Ps I 9,31-32; Spk I 11,32-33; Mp I 13,25-26. In order to make the verse fit the context, Buddhaghosa quotes it in a slightly edited version in his comment on "ekena samayena" in Sp 108,13-14.
Whenever Buddhaghosa quotes this verse, it is followed by a grammatical quotation which he ascribes to the porāṇās. In Buddhaghosa this normally means the atṭhakathācariyas:
porānā pana vannayanti: "tasmiṃ samaye ti vā, tena samayenā ti vā, taṃ samayan ti vā abhilāpamattabhedo esa. sabbattha bhummam eva attho" ti. ${ }^{11}$

The old ones, moreover, make the comment that "tasmiṃ samaye", or "tena samayena", or "tam samayam" is merely a difference of expression. In all [three] cases the sense is nothing but locative.

This prose fragment is the only instance of a grammatical reference in Buddhaghosa where he expressly ascribes views on points of grammar to the atṭhakathācariyas. This would seem to support the conclusion that the peculiar case terminology was in use in the lost atthakathās. But this, of course, cannot be taken as an indication of the existence of a complete system of Pāli grammar. The verse and the prose fragment are clearly context-bound in the sense that they specifically deal with the interpretation of certain irregularities of canonical usage.

The fact that Buddhaghosa makes extensive use of this seemingly archaic terminology contrasts with the fact that his grammatical terminology in general consists of Pāli translations of Sanskrit technical terms. The Samantapāsādikā, which may be considered representative of Buddhaghosa's grammatical vocabulary, ${ }^{12}$ contains

[^0]among others the following important technical terms: accantasaṃyoga $=$ sa. atyantasaṃyoga [cf. Pān II 1 29], ādesa = sa. ādeśa [cf. Pān I 1 56], itthambhūtakkhyāna = sa. itthaṃbhūtâkhyāna [cf. Pān I 4 90], itthambhütalakkhaṇa = sa. itthaṃbhütalakṣana [cf. Pān II 3 21], upapada [ts.; cf. Pān II 219 and passim], upasagga = sa. upasarga [cf. Pān I 459 and passim], nipāta [ts.; cf. Pān I 114 and passim], nimitta [= nimittasaptamī; ts.; cf. Mahā-bh ad Pān II 3 36], ${ }^{13}$ bhāva [ts.; cf. Pān I 2 21 and passim], bhāvalakkhaṇa = sa. bhāvalakṣana [cf. Pān II 3 37], linga [ts.; cf. Pān II 4 26], lopa [ts.; cf. Pān I 1 60], viparināma [ts.], viparyāya $[=$ vipallāsa $]=$ sa. viparya $(-\bar{a}-)$ ya, vibhatti $=$ sa. vibhakti.

Examples such as these show clearly that Buddhaghosa's grammatical vocabulary was largely made up of terms derived from Sanskrit grammar with the addition of a few terms which we may deduce were in use in the atṭhakathās, the historical background and development of which remain unknown.

In several instances, however, Buddhaghosa explicitly refers his readers to grammar (saddasattha $=$ sa. sabdaśāstra) or grammarians (saddalakkhanavidū, ${ }^{14}$ saddavidū, akkharacintak $\bar{a}$ ) for information about points of grammar that will justify his own grammatical analyses of the
accantasaṃyoga and nimitta (v. s.v. nimittattha) have erroneously been omitted from the index of grammatical terms. They are found, however, in the index of words and subjects.
${ }^{13}$ It is interesting that Vjb [Be 1960 57,26-27] on Sp 189,25 (nimittathe) quotes a Pāli version of a Sanskrit verse which is quoted in Mahā-bh ad Pān II 336 as an illustration of nimittasaptami.
${ }^{14}$ The actual meaning of this term is "those who know the rules of grammar", i.e. grammarians. "saddalakkhana" stands for grammar in Buddhaghosa's works; cf. the usage of sabda and lakṣana in Sanskrit grammar; v. Renou, Vocabulaire s. vv.


[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ Cf. Sv 33,29-31; Ps I 10,1-3; Spk I 12,1-3; Mp I 13,27-29; Sp 108,15-17.
    ${ }^{12}$ Cf. Sp VIII [indexes]. For unknown reasons the terms bhāva and bhāvalakkhana [e.g. at $\mathrm{Sp} 108,1$ ] are not recorded in the indexes. The terms
Pāli. This gives rise to the rather interesting problem of trying to identify the grammatical source or sources to which Buddhaghosa refers.

In the following analysis a number of such references found in Buddhaghosa's works will be addressed. Since there is uncertainty about the actual authorship of some of the works ascribed to Buddhaghosa, the analysis has been limited to those works for which the authorship is beyond doubt: Visuddhimagga [Vism], Samantapāsādikā [Sp], and the commentaries on the āgamās: Sumañgavilāsinī [Sv], Papañcasūdanī [Ps], Sāratthappakāsinī [Spk], and Manorathapūraṇī [Mp]. ${ }^{15} \mathrm{Sp}$ is especially rich in grammatical references, but the other commentaries also contain interesting material. In a few instances grammatical statements where Buddhaghosa does not explicitly refer to grammar have been analysed. Such instances are included here either because of their general interest or because they belong to the same set of problems which Buddhaghosa analyses in similar contexts with reference to grammar or grammarians.

The sources to which Buddhaghosa refers have in almost every instance been identified as Pāṇinian grammar, and although the present study does not claim to be exhaustive, it should certainly present sufficient evidence of the pervasive influence of Sanskrit grammar on Buddhaghosa's grammatical analyses. It would thus seem that a reconsideration of the role of Sanskrit in the formation and history of the Pāli grammatical literature is necessary. This will be addressed further in the conclusion.

## Visuddhimagga

1 [Vism 8,2-6]

[^0]In the first example from Visuddhimagga, Buddhaghosa comments upon the meaning of the word "silla" as it is defined by the grammarians (saddalakkhanavidū), in contrast to those "etymologists" who derive the word from "siras" (head) and "sitala" (cool). ${ }^{16}$
ken' atthena silan ti. silanatthena silaṃ. kim idam silanaṃ nāma. samādhānaṃ vā: kāyakammādīnaṃ susīlyavasena avippakinṇatā ti attho; upadhāranam vā: kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ patiṭthānavasena [so read with v.l.] ādhārabhāvo ti attho, etad eva h' ettha [v.l. hi ettha] atthadvayaṃ saddalakkhanavidū anujānanti. ${ }^{17}$

In what sense is it virtue ? It is virtue in the sense of discipline. What does discipline mean? It means either composure (samādhānaṃ), that is, the quality of not being scattered because the acts of the body, etc., are well disciplined, or supporting (upadhāranam), that is, being a support due to its being the basis of good dhammas. These two are the only meanings which the grammarians admit in this case.

The grammarians to which Buddhaghosa refers here cannot without further evidence be identified with any particular grammatical school. But we are probably justified in assuming that they belong to Pāṇini's school since the two meanings which Buddhaghosa ascribes to $\sqrt{ }$ sil are identical with those recorded in the collection of roots which is

traditionally ascribed to the Pāninians. Cf. sa-Dhātup I 556: šīla samādhau and sa-Dhātup X 332: šila upādharanẹ. ${ }^{18}$

## 2 [Vism 210,21-28]

This interesting passage is part of the paragraph where Buddhaghosa brings the canonical "etymologies" of the word "bhagavan" into focus. After closing the first section of the paragraph with a reference to the Niddesa for detailed information on the method of analysing (naya) its various derivations and meanings, ${ }^{19}$ he continues by quoting a verse that exemplifies an altemative method of analysing (aparo nayo) the word "bhagavan":
bhāgyavā bhaggavā yutto bhagehi ca vibhattavā
bhattavā vantagamano bhavesu bhagavā tato ti.
Before he continues discussing each of these "etymologies", Buddhaghosa presents a concise description of the rules of derivation upon which they are based. ${ }^{20} \mathrm{He}$ writes:
tattha, vannägamo vannavipariyayo ti ādikaṃ niruttilakkhanam gahetvā, saddanayena vā pisodarādipakkhepalakkhanam gahetvā, yasmā lokiyalokuttarasukhābhinibbattakam dānasīlādipārappattam bhāgyam

[^0]assa atthi, tasmā bhāgyavā ti vattabbe bhagavā ti vuccati ti ñātabbam.

In this case it should be known - either by adopting the rule of etymology (niruttilakkhanam) which runs: "letter insertion, letter metathesis", etc., or by adopting, according to the method of grammar (saddanayena), the rule that consists in interpolating [the word in question] in [the word class] beginning with "pisodara" 21 - that since he is blessed with having been perfected with regard to charity and morality, etc., which gives rise to mundane and transmundane happiness, he is called "bhagavan", although [in actuality] he ought to be called "bhāgyavan".

In this passage Buddhaghosa quotes the beginning of a Pāli version of the first pada of a Sanskrit verse summarizing five principles of etymological analysis, in order to identify the scope of the rule of etymology (niruttilakkhanam). The Sanskrit version is found in Kāśikā ad Pān VI $3109^{22}$ :
${ }^{21}$ Cf. Dhammapāla's commentary: ādikan ti ādisaddena vannavikāro, vannalopo, dhätuathena niyojanari cā ti imam tividham lakkhanam sanganhāti. saddanayena $\bar{a}$ ti byākarananayena. pisodarādīnam saddānam ākatiganabhāvato vuttam piso ... pe ... gahetvā ti pakkhipanam eva lakkhanam. tappariyāpannatākaranam hi pakkhipanam [Vism-mhṭ Be 1960 I 253,16-20]. Cf. also Vism-mhṭ Be 1960 II 252,3-4: vannägamaviparyayavikāravināsadhātuatthavisesayogehipancavidhassa niruttilakkhanassa vasena, and see next.
${ }^{22}$ The original Sanskrit version was identified by H.C. Warren; cf. Vism (ed. HOS) p. 173,30.


[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ Cf. Sadd 434,30 foll; 435,7 foll.; 564,25.
    ${ }^{19}$ Cf. Vism 210,19 and Nidd I 142,25 foll.
    ${ }^{20}$ Buddhaghosa and other commentators often refer to or quote Vism on this verse for detailed information on its analysis; cf. Sp 123,13 foll.; Sv 34,10; Ps I 10,15; Spk I 12,16; Mp I 14,13; Ud-a 24,21; It-a I 6,15; Pj I 107,27 foll.; II 444,8; Patis-a 532,12; only Nidd-a I 264,7 foll. elaborates on Buddhaghosa's analysis; cf. note 23 infra.
varnāgamo varnaviparyayaś ca dvau cāparau varnavikāranāśau dhātos tadarthātśayena yogas tad ucyate pañcavidham niruktam.

Letter insertion, letter metathesis, and the following two, namely, letter modification and letter elision, [plus] connecting the root with a meaning surpassing its [own] meaning - these are called the five ways of etymological analysis. ${ }^{23}$
${ }^{23}$ The first complete Pāli version of this verse is, to the best of my knowledge, found in Upasena's commentary on the Niddesa, which often refers to, or quotes, Buddhaghosa's Vism. The passage where the verse occurs is nothing but an elaborate version of the present section of Vism. It is important because it illustrates how the various principles of etymological analysis were applied to Pāli words. Cp. Nidd-a I 264,7-265,3:
vannāgamo, vannaviparyāyo,
dve cāpare vannavikāranāsā,
dhātūnam atthātisayena yogo,
tad uccate pañcavidham niruttan $t i$
evam vuttaniruttilakkhanam gahetvā padasiddhi veditabbā. tattha: "nakkhattarājā-r-iva tārakānan" [= Ja V 148,9; Pj II 146,6] ti ettha rakārāgamo viya avijjamānassa akkharassa āgamo vannāgamo nāma. himsanā himso ti vattabbe siho ti viya vijjamānakkharānam heṭthupariyavasena parivattanam vannavipariyāyo nāma. "navacchādake dāne dīyaī" [= Ja III 288,13 (cf. v.ll.)] ti ettha akārassa ekārāpajjanatā viya akkharassa aṁakkharāpajjanatā vannavikāro nāma. jīvanassa mūto jīvanamūto ti vattabbe jīmūto ti vakāranakārānam vināso viya vijjamānakkharavināso vannavināso nāma. "phāruaāhi vācāhi pakubbamāno āsajja mam tvam vadasī kumārā" [= Ja IV 47,12] ti ettha pakubbamāno-padassa abhibhavamāno ti atthapatipādanam viya tattha tattha yathāyogam visesatthayogo dhātūnam atthātisayena yogo nāma. evam niruttilakkhanam gahetvā, saddanayena vā pisodarādipakkhepalakkhanam gahetvā yasmā lokiyalokuttarasukhābhinibbattakam dānasilādipārappattam bhāgyam assa atthi, tasmā bhāgyavā ti vattabbe bhagavā ti vuccati ti ñatabbam. The verse is quoted in Ap-a 102,17-18 (incomplete version), a comparatively late commentary, and is

The grammatical method (saddanaya) consists in analysing the word "bhagavan" as if it were a member of the class of word forms (ākrtigana) ${ }^{24}$ belonging to the ganapātha "prṣodarādi", to which Pānini refers in Pān VI 3 109: "prṣodarādīni" yathopadistam: [the elision, insertion and modification of letters that are observed in such cases as] "prṣodara", etc., follows the way in which they are stated [by the experts in etymology].

There is clearly no absolute contrast between the two methods since the words that are members of the ganapātha are subject to much the same rules of derivation as those defined in the verse quoted by the Kāśikā and Buddhaghosa. ${ }^{25}$ The reason why they are contrasted in this case is probably the fact that "etymology" as such is not within the scope of Pāṇinian grammar, but belongs to a separate branch of grammatical śāstra.

It is not possible to identify the source from which Buddhaghosa quotes, nor are we in a position to decide whether he himself is responsible for translating the Sanskrit original into Pāli, or whether he was simply adopting an already existing Pāli version. It is highly unlikely that he should have quoted the verse from the Kāśikā since this important commentary is generally supposed to have been written in the 7th century A.D. All we can safely say is that
often quoted by the Pāli grammarians; cf. e.g. Rūp 277,13-16; Mogg-p 29,5-8 [cf. Mogg-p 29,9 foll. and Mogg-pd pp. 38-39 ad loc.]; Sadd 877,9-11.
${ }^{24}$ The akrtigana is by definition an open list of words to which other words undergoing the same operations may be added. Cf. Renou, Vocabulaire and $D S G$ s.v.
${ }^{25}$ Cf. Kāś ad Pān VI 3 109: prṣodaraprakārāni śabdarūpāni, yeṣu lopāgamavarnavikārāh sāstrena na vihitāh drīyante ca, tāni yathopadistāni sādhūni bhavanti. yāni yāni yathopadistāni, śiṣtair uccāritāni prayuktāni, tāni tathaivānigantavyāni; cf. also Mahā-bh ad loc.
Buddhaghosa and the authors of the Kāśikā were conversant with a grammatical tradition where the verse was somehow attached to this specific Pānini sūtra as part of its commentary. Patañjali does not quote the verse ad loc., but this, of course, does not exclude the possibility that it belongs to a grammatical tradition antedating Patañjali.

In any case, it clearly appears from Buddhaghosa's concise description of the two methods that he was assuming that his readers would easily be able to identify the full scope of the analytical principles involved, on the basis of a summary reference.

## 3 [Vism 310,18-22]

In this example Buddhaghosa discusses briefly the etymology of the word satta (= sa. sattva) as it occurs in the passage (= Paṭis II 130,26 foll.: sabbe sattā averā abyāpajjhā ... attānam parihantu, etc.) upon which he is commenting. First he quotes S III 190,2-6 ${ }^{26}$ where the word is defined in terms of a human being who is attached to (satta $=$ sa. sakta) and clings to (visatta $=$ sa. visakta) the khandhas. He continues:
rūlhisaddena pana vītarāgesu pi ayaṃ vohāro vattati yeva, vilīvamaye pi vījanīvisese tālavantavohāro viya. akkharacintakā pana attham avicāretvā nāmamattam etan ti icchanti. ye pi attham vicārenti te sattayogena [so read for Ee satvāyogena] sattā ti icchanti. ${ }^{27}$

However, because it is a conventional term (rūlhisadda), this designation also applies to those who are

[^0]without desire, just as the word "palm fan" [tālavanta $=$ sa. tālavrnta] applies to a particular kind of fan, although it is made of split bamboo. But the grammarians (akkharacintak $\bar{a}$ ) maintain that it is a mere name (nāmamattam) without considering its meaning. Some people who take its meaning into consideration maintain that beings are called "sattā" [ = sa. sattva, mfn.] because they are possessed of "satta" [= sa. sattva, n.], intelligence.

It is uncertain which grammarians Buddhaghosa refers to in this context. The reference is too concise to enable us to trace it to any specific grammatical work. What is important in this context is that he contrasts the idea that the term as such can be derived [although it can be applied in other meanings than the one which is supported by the etymology] with the grammarians' claim that it is a mere name for which no etymology can be adduced. There is no reason to doubt that the origin of this discussion is to be found in the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. Unfortunately Dhammapāla's commentary does not offer any clue to what Buddhaghosa's sources might have been.

## 4 [Vism 423,23-25]

In this paragraph Buddhaghosa explains why the "eye of knowledge" (ñannacakkhu) has the epithet "divine" (dibbam). He presents inter alia the following two explanations followed by the remark that they should be known according to grammar:


[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ rūpe kho Rādha yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā tanhā tatra satto tatra visatto tasmā satto ti vuccati. vedanāya sā̃ñāya sā̃khāresu viṁ̃āne yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā tanhā tatra satto tatra visatto tasmā satto ti vuccati ti.
    ${ }^{27}$ Qu. Paṭis-a 604,36-38 and 57,20-22.
ālokapariggahena mahājutikattā pi dibbam, tirokudd̀ddigatarūpadassanena mahāgatikattā pi dibbam. tam sabbam saddasatthānusārena veditabbam. ${ }^{28}$

It is both "divine" because it is of great splendour (mahājutikattā) due to its possessing light, and "divine" because it has an enormous range (mahāgatikattā) due to its seeing objects that are far removed in space and the like. All this should be known according to grammar.

As in the first example from Vism, Buddhaghosa's commentary deals with a question of semantics: the meaning of the root $\sqrt{ }$ div. Since he uses the terms mahājutikatta and mahāgatikatta in order to define the meaning of the epithet "dibba", one would assume that this grammatical reference too is to sa-Dhātup where the two meanings juti (to light) and gati (to move), among others, are ascribed to $\sqrt{ }$ div. Cf. sa-Dhātup IV 1 divú: krīdāvijigīṣāvyavahāradyutistutimodanamadasvapnakāntigatiṣu. Dhammapāla's ṭikā supports the assumption ${ }^{29}$.

## 5 [Vism 518,27-32]

[^0]In this passage Buddhaghosa analyses the meaning of the suffix $-t \bar{a}$, when used in the compound "idappaccayat $\vec{a}$ ". He writes:
yathā vuttānam [i.e. in S II 25,17] etesam jarāmaranàdīnam paccayato vā paccayasamūhato vā idappaccayatā ti vutto, tatrāyam vacanattho: imesam paccayā idappaccayā; idappaccayā eva idappaccayatā; idappaccayānam vā samūho idappaccayatā. lakkhanam pan' ettha saddasatthato pariyesitabbam. ${ }^{30}$

The term "idappaccayat $\vec{a}$ " is used either in terms of the conditions of these, or in terms of the collection of conditions of these, such as they have been explained [above], namely, old age, death and the rest. The meaning of the expression in this case is as follows: "idappaccay $\bar{a}$ " means "conditions of these"; "idappaccayatā" means "exclusively (eva) conditions of these". Or, "idappaccayatā" means "a collection of conditions of these". In these cases, moreover, the rule should be sought in grammar.

The grammatical rules to which Buddhaghosa in this case asks his reader to refer are two Pānini sūtras. The one which justifies the first alternative is Pān V 4 27: devāt tal: the suffix "tā", when attached to the word "deva" [means "deva" as such]. ${ }^{31}$ In order to make the delimitative force of the suffix clear Buddhaghosa uses the particle "eva" to which Indian grammar traditionally ascribes a delimitative and restrictive force (avadhārana). ${ }^{32}$ The second is Pāṇ IV 2 [37+] 43: grāmajanabandhu-

For purely doctrinal reasons Buddhaghosa does not refer his reader to the well-known Pānini sūtra V 1119 defining the other more general function of the abstract suffixes "tva" and "tä": tasya bhāve tvatalau: the abstract suffixes "tva" and "tä" are used in the sense of the essence or quality of the thing [denoted by the term to which the two suffixes are attached]. But it is clear that there must have been some Buddhist scholars who did actually interpret idappaccayatā with reference to this function of the suffix " $t \bar{a}$ ", because Buddhaghosa refers briefly to their view, but only to refute it. ${ }^{35}$

## 6 [Vism 519,34-520,6]

In this section Buddhaghosa presents and rejects the interpretation of some Buddhists who maintain that the term "paticcasamuppāda" denotes mere arising (uppädamattam), in the sense

[^0]that it means arising dependently (paticca) and correctly so (sammā), that is, without reference to such causes as those which the heretics imagine, namely, Primordial Matter (pakati), The Person (purisa) and the like. ${ }^{36}$

The final argument of the four which Buddhaghosa presents for rejecting this idea is that it is not justified because according to their interpretation the term "paticca" becomes semantically disjointed from the rest of the compound and is therefore virtually meaningless (saddabhedato). ${ }^{37}$ The argument is developed in the following paragraph. Buddhaghosa does not explicitly refer to grammar in this instance, but the nature and importance of the argument are such that it would seem natural to include it among his grammatical references. He writes:
saddabhedato ti paticcasaddo ca pan' āyam samāne kattari pubbakāle payujjamāno atthasiddhikaro hoti. seyyathīdam: "cakkhuñ ca paticca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviñnānan" [= S II 72,4] ti. idha pana bhāvasādhanena uppādasaddena saddhim payujjamāno

36Cf.: kecí pana paticca sammā ca titthiyaparikappitapakatipurisddikārananirapekkho uppādo paticcasamuppādo ti evam uppādamattam paticcasamuppādo ti vadanti, Vism 518,33-35. It is not clear to whom Buddhaghosa refers. The emphasis is on arising as such without particular reference to its causes and conditions provided that heretical ideas of causes, such as the prakrii of Sāṃkhya, etc., are excluded. Could it be that Buddhaghosa briefly presents the view of SthaviraVasuvarmā, which is referred to in Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa as follows: ahetunityahetuvädapratisedhārtham ity apare [= Sthaviravasuvarmā, Sphutārtha ad loc.]. nāsati hetau bhāvo bhavati, na cānutpatitmato nityāt prakritipurusädikāt kiñcid utpadyata iti, AkBhāṣ 47,78 ? Perhaps Vasuvarmā interpreted "pratītyasamutpāda" in the light of the other canonical explanation of arising "asmin satīdam bhavati, asyotpādād idam utpadyate", to which the quotation relates. In any case it has this generalised form which appears to be the idea underlying the view which Buddhaghosa rejects.

"Because of word disjunction": again, when the word "pațicca", provided that the agent is the same (samāne kattari), is used in the sense of [the action expressed by the verb to which the absolutive suffix is added] being anterior in time [to the action expressed by the finite verb], it achieves its meaning (atthasiddhikaro). As, for instance, [in the following sentence]: "After having come into contact with the eye and the sense objects, eye consciousness arises [= S II 72,4]". In the present case, however, when [the word "pațicca"] is used together with the word "uppāda" which is an action noun (bhāvasādhanena), ${ }^{38}$ it leads to word disjunction since the agent is not the same, and so it does not achieve any meaning at all. Therefore, also because of word disjunction, pațiccasamuppāda is not mere arising.

What is important for Buddhaghosa to point out in this connection is that, in order for the term "paticcasamuppāda" to be meaningful, it is necessary for the two actions expressed by the absolutive form "paticca" and the action noun "samuppāda" to have the same agent (kattā). If this were not the case, there would be no connection between them in terms of their having the same agent. To illustrate this point Buddhaghosa quotes a well-known passage from Saṃyuttanikāya where cakkhuviñãana, by implication, represents the

[^0]identical agent of the successive verbal actions expressed by "paticca" and "uppajati". ${ }^{39}$ The opponent, however, generalizes the scope of meaning of "paticcasamuppāda" to such an extent that it becomes virtually impossible to interpret it with reference to specific agents and specific causes and conditions. Consequently, the action expressed by the term "paticca" would not at all relate, by virtue of identity of agent, to the action expressed by "uppāda".

In order to clarify this idea he makes an implicit reference to Pānini's definition of the usage and meaning of the absolutive suffix (ktvā), which is found in Pāṇ III 4 21: samānakartrkayoh pūrvakāle: [when two verbal actions] have the same agent [the absolutive suffix attached to the verb expressing one action] is used in the sense of being anterior in time [to the action expressed by the other verb]. 40

Buddhaghosa's interpretation, of course, entails the obvious paradox that in order for cakkhuviñãana to arise it must first be dependent and thus already existent, which makes its arising illogical. Perhaps the underlying intention of the opponent's thesis was exactly to avoid this paradox by emphasising the notion of origination, in which case Buddhaghosa stands out as a conservative defender of what he considered to be the correct Theravāda tradition, while at the same time adhering strictly to the original Pāninian definition of the semantical function of the absolutive suffix.

We know from a parallel discussion with grammarians recorded in Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa about the correct interpretation of "paticcasamuppāda", ${ }^{41}$ that the Buddhists tried to avoid the unwanted

implications, pointed out by the grammarians, of a strict Pāninian interpretation of "paticca", by taking the absolutive suffix as indicating an action that takes place simultaneously with the action expressed by the action noun "samuppäda". For this interpretation they could refer to one of Katyāyana's vārttikas on Pānini's sūtra, which allows for interpreting "paticca" as expressing an action that is simultaneous with the action expressed by "samuppäda". 42

We do not find any trace of this discussion in Buddhaghosa's works, but it was well-known to subsequent generations of Pāli writers. ${ }^{43}$ Dhammapāla, who was conversant with this discussion and the relevant Sanskrit grammatical literature, as appears from his tikā, is evidently embarrassed by the implications of Buddhaghosa's criticism and tries to avoid them by claiming that Buddhaghosa only refers to Pānini's definition of the usage of the absolutive suffix in general terms (yebhuyyena), whereas in the present case the term "paticca" can only be interpreted as expressing an action that is simultaneous with the action expressed by "samuppäda". 44

It would be interesting to know whether Buddhaghosa relied on Sanskrit sources for the elaborate discussion of "paticcasamuppäda" in Chapter 17 of Visuddhimagga, which from a doctrinal point of view is one of the most complex sections of the work. It is not unlikely, but only a detailed investigation of the chapter as a whole will make it possible to reach a conclusion on this point.

The present context is sufficient to conclude that the references to grammar and grammarians in Visuddhimagga clearly indicate that

Buddhaghosa was conversant with the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, which in all likelihood is identical with Pāninian grammar. This conclusion is furthermore corroborated by the evidence found in the atthakathās ascribed to Buddhaghosa. In the following a number of references to grammar and grammarians found in these works will be analysed.

## Samantapāsādikā

## 1 [Sp 204,25-32 ad Vin III 13,5-6]

In the Vinaya passage which Buddhaghosa comments upon: na tvaṃ tāta Sudinna kiñci dukkhassa jānāsī ti, it would seem natural to construe na ... kiñci jānāsi with dukkhassa, in the sense: "you, good Sudinna, know nothing of misery". ${ }^{45}$ This is apparently what he had in mind, as is evident from the following paraphrase: tvaṃ tāta Sudinna kiñci appamattakam pi kalabhāgaṃ dukkhassa na jānāsi: "you, good Sudinna, know nothing, i.e., not even the slightest fraction of a fraction, of misery". But in addition to this straightforward exegesis, he offers two more complex alternative interpretations of the clause:
athavā kiñci dukkhena nānubhosī ti attho: karanatthe sāmivacanaṃ anubhavanatthe ca jānanā. athavā kiñci dukkhaṃ na sarasī ti attho: upayogatthe svāmivacanaṃ saranatthe ca jānanā. vikappadvaye pi purimapadassa uttarapadena samānavibhattilopo

[^0]datthabbo. taṃ sabbaṃ saddasatthānusārena ñātabbaṃ.

Either the meaning is: "you do not suffer from any misfortune", the genitive (sāmivacanam) being used in the sense of the instrumental (karanatthe) and $\sqrt{ } j \tilde{n} \bar{a}$ in the sense of "experiencing, suffering" (anubhavanatthe), or the meaning is: "you do not remember any misfortune", the genitive being used in the sense of the accusative (upayogatthe) and $\sqrt{ } j \tilde{n} \bar{a}$ in the sense of "remembering, recalling" (saranatthe). In either alternative (vikappadvaye), however, one should take into consideration that the case morpheme which the preceding word (purimapadassa $=$ kiñci) has in common with the subsequent word (uttarapadena $=$ dukkhassa) is elided (samānavibhattilopo). All this should be known in accordance with grammar (saddasatthānusārena).

According to this interpretation, it is obvious that kiñci becomes difficult to construe unless it is assumed that it is in agreement with dukkhassa. Buddhaghosa therefore postulates that kiñci is actually in agreement with dukkhassa, when it is assumed that kiñci $=$ kassaci because the genitive case morpheme which indicates the agreement has been elided from kiñci.

It has not been possible to find any justification in traditional Indian grammar for adding supposedly elided case morphemes in the way suggested by Buddhaghosa, but the grammar which justifies his interpretation of $\sqrt{ } j \tilde{n} \bar{a}$ constructed with the genitive in the sense indicated above can easily be identified. In both cases it is based on the application of two Pānini sütras. The first alternative is undoubtedly based on Pān II


[^0]:    ${ }^{45}$ This interpretation presupposes that kiñci is used substantivally and is to be construed with dukkhassa. It is, of course, also possible to construe kiñci adverbially, in which case dukkhassa has to be construed with jānāsi in the sense suggested by Buddhaghosa in the following.
$3[50+] 51$ : jño 'vidarthasya karane: the verb $v_{j} j \tilde{n} \bar{a}$, when not used in the sense of "to know", is constructed with the genitive in the sense of the instrument kāraka. ${ }^{46}$ The second is based on the subsequent sūtra Pān II 3 [50+] 52: adhīgarthadayesām karmani: verbs, when used in the sense of "remembering" [cf. sa-Dhātup II 38] ... , are constructed with the genitive in the sense of the object kāraka. ${ }^{47}$

There is no reason to doubt that the grammar (saddasattha) Buddhaghosa refers to is identical with Pāninian grammar. But the grammatical source which justifies samānavibhattilopo remains unknown. If there were any identifiable grammatical tradition justifying samānavibhattilopo in the way suggested by Buddhaghosa, it is unlikely that an eminent scholar like Sāriputta would have failed to identify it. Under such circumstances the possibility cannot be excluded that it represents Buddhaghosa's own contribution to the grammatical analysis of the Pāli. Sāriputta corroborates, however, the assumption of Pāninian grammar as Buddhaghosa's main source through implicit references to Kāśikā ad loc. ${ }^{48}$

[^0]
## 2 [Sp 209,27-210,1 ad Vin III 16,5]

After having quoted the passage in question: atthi nāma tāta Sudinna ābhidosikam kummāsam paribhunjissasī ti: "Is it possible, dear Sudinna, that you are eating last evening's barley-gruel ?", Buddhaghosa continues:
akkharacintakā pan' ettha imam lakkhanam vadanti: anokappanāmarisanatthavasena etam atthi-nāma-sadde [so read for Ee atthi nāma sadde] upapade paribhunjissasī ti anāgatavacanaṃ katam. tassāyam attho: atthi nāma - pe - paribhunjissasī ti idam paccakkham pi aham na saddahāmi, na marisayāmī [so read with v.l. for Ee parisayämī] $t i$.

In this case, moreover, the grammarians (akkharacintak $\bar{a}$ ), set forth the following rule (lakkhanam): according to whether the meaning is that something is not likely to take place, or is not to be tolerated (anokappanāmarisanatthavasena), the future paribhunjissasi is employed, when the expression "is it possible ?" is a sentence complement (atthi-nāmasadde upapade). The meaning of the [sentence] "Is it possible... ?" is as follows: "I do not believe it, even though it is evident, nor do I tolerate it".

In this grammatical analysis, Buddhaghosa focuses on a syntactical peculiarity of the sentence complement (upapada) "atthi", which systematically requires construction with the future tense, whereas, from a semantical point of view, the implied tense in such a context is to be interpreted as present. ${ }^{49}$ The grammarians mentioned by Buddhaghosa in this case are undoubtedly identical with the Pāninians since the analysis is based on Pān III 3 [145+] 146: kimkilāstyartheṣu lṛ: the future (denoted lṛt) is used when [the words] "how comes it?" (kimkila) or [the words] meaning "is it possible?" (asti) [are syntactically constructed with it, and the action is either not likely to take place, or not to be tolerated]. ${ }^{50}$

## 3 [Sp 288,12-15 ad Vin III 42,13-14]

katham hi nāma so bhikkhave moghapuriso sabbamattikāmayam kuṭikam karissatī [= Vin III 42,13-14] ti idam atitatthe anāgatavacanaṃ akāsī ti vuttam hoti; tassa lakkhanam saddasatthato pariyesitabbam.

With regard to the [sentence]: "How can it be, monks, that this foolish man has made a hut out of nothing

[^0]mud ?", it is explained that the future (anāgatavacanam) is used in the sense of the past (atitatthe); the rule (lakkhanam) for this should be sought in grammar (saddasatthato).

The intention of this note is to explain why the future is used in preference to the tense required by the actual time [ $=$ past time] of the action referred to. In the present case Buddhaghosa refers to Pān III 3 [142+] 144: kimvṛtte linīṛtau: "the [inflections] of the potential mood (liñ) and the future (lṛt) are used when [interrogative pronouns like] 'kim' occur [as a sentence complement, the meaning implied by the sentence being that of 'censure']". 51

One would have expected Buddhaghosa to refer to Pān III 3 [142+] 143: vibhāsā kathami liñ ca: the [inflections] of the potential mood (liñ) [as well as the inflections of the present tense (lat)] are optionally used, when [the word] "katham" [is used as a sentence complement, the meaning implied by the sentence being that of "censure"]. ${ }^{52}$ There are in fact quite a number of instances in the Vin where "katham" is constructed with the potential mood, but they are not commented upon by Buddhaghosa. ${ }^{53}$ It is possible, however, that he reinterpreted the scope of Pān III 3144 in order to find a grammatical justification for the usage in the Pāli, which in this case deviates from the usage described by Pānini. Sāriputta's commentary on this passage in Sp

[^1]
[^0]:    ${ }^{49}$ As noted by Sāriputta in his comment, the usage of the future tense in a construction like this is exclusively present in meaning.

shows that he identified the reference to saddasattha with Pān III 3 $144 .{ }^{54}$

4 [Sp 296,13-14 ad Vin III 44,19]
Once again Buddhaghosa focuses on a question of semantics: the meaning of $i$ i pac. The term vipācenti which he comments upon in this case is found in the following passage: manussā ujjhāyanti khīyanti vipācenti: "alajjino ime samanā sakyaputtiyā ... " [= Vin III 44,19 foll.]. He writes:
vipācentī ti vitthārikaṃ karonti, sabbattha pattharanti; ayañ ca attho saddasatthānusārena veditabbo.
"vipācenti" means: they disseminate far and wide, they report in detail everywhere. The meaning, moreover, should be known according to grammar.

Grammar in this case is, as in the previous examples from Vism, in all probability identical with sa-Dhātup. Cf. sa-Dhātup X 109: paci vistāravacane. ${ }^{55}$

[^0]5 [Sp 480,26-481,6 ad Vin III 88,2-4]
The problem which Buddhaghosa addresses this time is how to interpret the past participle "bhāsito" which occurs in the following passage:
eso yeva kho āvuso seyyo yo amhākaṃ gihīnaṃ aññamaññassa uttarimanussadhammassa vanno bhāsito ti.

The best thing, friends, is if we speak to householders in praise of one another's superhuman properties.

It would seem natural in the present case to construe the genitive "amhākam" [= the agent] with "bhāsito" used in the sense of the present tense. ${ }^{56}$ If, however, it is interpreted according to the absolute tense value of the past participle, and this is clearly how Buddhaghosa interprets the form, it would seem to be in contradiction to the context in which the enunciation occurs: the Vajjī janapada is suffering from the famine and the monks have difficulties in providing for themselves. Therefore they decide to speak in praise of one another's spiritual attainments in order to ingratiate themselves with householders, hoping that they, on those grounds, will provide for them. Since the context makes it impossible to interpret "bhāsito" as referring to the past, Buddhaghosa suggests complementing the sentence in such a way that the intention becomes unambiguous. He writes:

[^1]:    ${ }^{56}$ Cf. Pān II 3 67: ktasya ca vartamāne: The past participle in -ta [is constructed with the genitive], when used in the sense of the present tense. Cf. also Pān III 2 187-188; Pān does not mention $\sqrt{ }$ bhāṣ among the roots the pp. of which may be interpreted in the sense of the present tense. In Pāli, however, this usage seems to be extended to include other instances than those described by Pānini.
anāgatasambandhe pana asati na etehi yo tasmim khane bhāsito 'va yasmā [CeBeSe so; Ee tasmā] na yujjati, tasmā anāgatasambandham katvā yo evam bhāsito bhavissati so seyyo ti evam ettha attho veditabbo. lakkhanam pana saddasatthato pariyesitabbam.

Since the [praise they] spoke at that moment would be unjustified, if there were no connection [of bhāsito $=$ pp. of $\sqrt{ }$ bhās] with the future tense (anāgatasambandhe pana asati), by formulating a connection with the future tense, the meaning is in this case to be understood as follows: "the best thing would be if we spoke (bhāsito bhavissati) in such and such a way". The rule, moreover, should be sought in grammar.

The rule to which Buddhaghosa refers here as a justification for complementing the verbal form bhāsito with the future form bhavissati [from $\sqrt{b h u ̈}$ ], is found in Pān III 41 : dhātusambandhe pratyayāh: affixes are [valid in denoting a time other than the one for which they have been specifically enjoined] when they are used for [establishing] a relation between [the meanings of] the roots [in question].

The problem which Pānini addresses in this sūtra is that the usage of a particular suffix is generally restricted to the specific tense value that is attached to it. For instance, according to Pān III 285 a word like "agniṣtomayājin" has a past tense value. It denotes a person who already has performed the agnistoma. But in a sentence like "agniṣtomayājy asya putro janitā": "he shall have a son who will perform the agnistoma", a word with a past tense value ("agniṣtomayājin") is construed with a word that has a future tense value ("janitā"). In such a case the future tense value of janitā takes precedence over the past tense value of
agniṣtomayājin, which thus assumes a future value. The same is the case in a sentence like: krtah katah śvo bhavitā: "the mat will be made tomorrow". In this clause the future tense value of bhavitā takes precedence over the absolute tense value of the past participle krtah. ${ }^{57}$

Here too, there is no reason for doubting that the grammar to which Buddhaghosa refers his readers is identical with Pāṇinian grammar. Sāriputta cannot have been in doubt since he quotes the sūtra in question. In addition he presents a slightly edited quotation from the Kāśikā. ${ }^{58}$

The expression "scared" [ukkhetito] is used because he is scared of the Noble Path. ... The meaning is to be sought in grammar.

## 7 [Sp 584,16-21 ad Vin III 163,21,30]

It is not clear how we are to interpret Buddhaghosa's reference to grammar (saddalakkhanam) in this case. The two words he comments upon (duttho doso) occur in the following passage: yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhum duttho doso appatito ... anuddhamseyya: "whatever monk, offended, indignant ${ }^{60}$, and ill-tempered, would defame a monk ... " [= Vin III 163,21-22]. The niddesa presents the following gloss on the two words: duttho doso ti kupito anattamano anabhiraddho āhatacitto khilajāto [= Vin III 163,30-31], but this gloss obviously does not clarify the question of how to construe them. The past participle duttho [from $\sqrt{ }$ dus] presents no problem, but doso does. In this particular context it can only be interpreted as an adjective which in meaning is related to, if not synonymous with, duttho and derived from the same root. ${ }^{61}$ This, apparently, is also the view of Buddhaghosa, who seems to interpret doso as a derivative of the causative stem of $\sqrt{ }$ dus:
"duttho doso" ti, dūsito c' eva dūsako ca, uppanne hi dose puggalo tena dosena dūsito hoti: pakatibhāvam

[^0]jahāpito, tasmā duttho ti vuccati. parañ ca dūseti vināseti, tasmā doso ti vuccati. iti duttho doso ti. ekasss' ev' etam puggalassa dassitam [v.l. nidassanam], tena vuttam duttho doso ti dūsito c' eva dūsako cā ti. tattha saddalakkhanam pariyesitabbam.
"Offended, offending", that is, "one who is both offended and one who offends (dūsito c' eva dūsako $c a$ )". Because ( $h i$ ), when an offence has taken place (uppanne dose), a person is offended on account of this offence, that is, he is shocked (pakatibhāvam jahāpito), therefore he is called "offended". And because he causes another [person] to be offended and frustrated therefore he is called "offending". Hence (iti) [the words] "offended, offending". This is used as an illustration of a single person according to the difference in his behaviour (ākāranānattena). Therefore it is said [above]: "offended, offending", that is, "one who is both offended and one who offends". One should consult grammar (saddalakkhanam) on this point.

The question is whether Buddhaghosa actually wants his reader to refer to grammar for information on the derivation and meaning of duttha and doso. It is clear that his purpose is to show that the two terms are mutually opposed, in the sense that one (duttha) is intransitive (kammasādhana), whereas the other (doso) is transitive (kattusādhana), which, of course, is reflected in their respective meanings. This is also the way in which Sāriputta understands Buddhaghosa. But in addition he points out that the reason why Buddhaghosa says that a person who is dūsito is one who is shocked, is because $\sqrt{ }$ dus is read [in the Dhātupātha]


[^0]:    ${ }^{59} \mathrm{Cf}$.: khitasaddam saddasatthavidū uttāsathe pathantī ti āha "svāyam attho saddasatthatato pariyesitabbo" ti [Sp-t Be 1960 II 290,19-20]; Sadd 352,11: khita utrāsane.
    ${ }^{60}$ The translation is tentative. It is obvious from the context that corrupted and corrupting are too strong; doso is probably used epexegetically of duttho in order to show that is does not mean corrupted, but rather indignant and upset, which the context would seem to support.
    ${ }^{61}$ In Pāli dosa normally occurs as a noun. This passage is the only recorded instance in the canon where it would seem necessary to interpret dosa as an adjective.
in the sense of alteration (vikatiyam pathitattā). ${ }^{62}$ This remark seems to point to the fact that we are dealing with yet another reference to saDhātup, which in view of the other references to sa-Dhātup is likely to be true. In that case it must be a reference to sa-Dhātup IV 76: duṣa vaikrtye.

## 8 [Sp 770,33-37 ad Vin IV 38,2-3]

The last instance of explicit reference to grammar in Buddhaghosa's Samantapāsādikā is presumably also to sa-Dhātup. In this case it is to the meaning of the root $u t+\sqrt{ }$ jhe ( $=\mathrm{sa} . \sqrt{ }$ dhy $\bar{a}$ ). The passage in which the form occurs presents no problem; it represents one of the stereotypes that are often met with in the Nikāyas.
ujjhāpenti [= Vin IV 38,2-3; this reading is recorded as a variant by the ct., which reads ujjhāyanti]; Dabbam Mallaputtam bhikkhū ujjhäyanti ... tam āyasmantam tehi bhikkhūhi avajānāpenti avaññāya olokāpenti lāmakato vā cintāpentī ti attho. lakkhanam pan' ettha saddasatthānusārena veditabbam.

The definition (lakkhanam) is this time found in sa-Dhātup I 957: dhyai cintāyām. The identification is, if Sāriputta is correct, confirmed by his explicit reference to the Dhātupātha, with the remark

[^0]that, since verbal roots have multiple meanings, the root $\sqrt{ }$ jhe has also the meaning of "looking down upon". 63

## Sumangalavilāsinī

## $1[\mathrm{Sv} 43,13-15$ ad D I 2,9$]$

In this short passage Buddhaghosa comments upon the expression "acchariyam āvuso". The subject matter is the etymology of the word acchariya. First he presents the grammatical derivation (saddanaya) which he subsequently contrasts with the etymological derivation presented by the Aṭthakathās (aṭthakathānaya). The saddanaya is explained in this way:
tattha andhassa pabbatārohanam viya niccam na hotī ti acchariyam. ayam tāva saddanayo. ${ }^{64}$

In this case acchariyam means something unusual (na ... niccam), like for instance a blind man who goes mountain climbing. This, in the first place, is the grammatical derivation ${ }^{65}$.

The saddanaya to which Buddhaghosa refers here is in all likelihood identical with Pān VI 1 147: āścaryam anitye: the word 'āscaryam' [is formed with the augment $s u t=s-]$ in the sense of something unusual. ${ }^{66}$

## 2 [Sv 245,16-19 ad D 1 87,7-8]

In this case Buddhaghosa selects the following clause for a grammatical comment: Ukkaṭham ajjhāvasaī ti, and continues:
upasaggavasen' ettha bhummatthe upayogavacanam veditabbam ... tath' [Ee tath'] eva lakkhanam [CeBe so; Ee na-] saddasatthato [so read with v.l. and Sv-t] pariyesitabbam.

In the present case it should be understood that the accusative, because of the preposition, is used in the sense of the locative. ... The rule for this should be sought in grammar. ${ }^{67}$

The definition which Buddhaghosa has in mind in this case is Pān I $4[45+46+]$ 48: upānavadhyāni vasah: [the place of the action] of

[^0]$\sqrt{v a s}$, when preceded by [the prepositions] upa, anu, adhi, and $\bar{a}$ [is called "karma" (= the object kāraka)]. ${ }^{68}$

## 3 [Sv 481,3-5 ad D II 55,3]

Even though Buddhaghosa does not explicitly refer to grammarians or to grammar in this concise explanation of an apparent grammatical anomaly, there is good reason for including it among the examples of his references to grammar. Firstly, Buddhaghosa contrasts this explanation with the subsequent explanation of the Aṭthakathācariyas. Judging from the way in which he normally contrasts the views of the grammarians on points of grammar with the views represented by the Aṭthakathās, one can assume that his explanation is based on the views of the grammarians. Secondly, in his tikā, Dhammapāla expressly identifies Buddhaghosa's grammatical analysis with the opinion of the grammarians (akkharacintakā).
tatrāyam anuttānapadavaṇnanā. Kurūsu viharatī ti, Kurū nāma jānapadino rājakumārā, tesaṃ nivāso eko pi janapado rūḷhisaddena Kurū ti vuccati: tasmim Kurūsu janapade. ${ }^{69}$

In this case the following explanation is dealing with an obscure word. "Was dwelling in the Kuru state": [the plural form] Kurū denotes those citizens who are descendants of the ruling class [of the state]. Although

For an identical analysis cf. Ps III 414,24-26 ad M II 164,6.

[^1]:    ${ }^{68}$ Cf. Kāś ad loc.: upa, anu, adhi, à ity evampūrvasya vazater ādhāro yah, tat kārakam karmasañjham bhavati. Sv-pt ad loc. would seem to represent a slightly edited version of Kāś. Cf. note 67 supra.
    ${ }^{69} \mathrm{Qu}$. Ps I 225,4-6; Cf. the identical passages in Sv 279,4-7 ad D I 111,2: Aṅgesu; 294,4-6 ad D I 127,2: Magadhesu and 672,3-8 ad D II 253,3: Sakkesu.
their habitation is singular, their state is denoted by the conventional term "Kurū [in the plural]". [Consequently the loc. pl. "kurūsu" means] "in the Kuru state".

The grammatical problem which Buddhaghosa briefly identifies and explains is the fact that the plural form "Kurū", which actually denotes the descendants of the ruling class of a certain state, is used as the name of this state. Since the state as such is confined to a specific territory, one would expect it to be denoted by a noun in the singular. Moreover, when the words "Kurū" and "janapada" are used in apposition there is no syntactical agreement between them. The reason is, as Buddhaghosa explains, that the usage of the word "Kurū" is determined by convention (rülhisadda), which in the present case means that usage takes precedence over the general rules of syntactical agreement.

Buddhaghosa's source in this case is no doubt Pāninian grammar. In his tīkā, Dhammapāla quotes (in slightly edited Pāli versions) two sūtras in which Pāṇini refers to certain views on grammatical derivation, the necessity and validity of which he is questioning later on.

The first sūtra quoted by Dhammapāla is Pāṇ I $251^{70}$ : lupi yuktavad vyaktivacane ${ }^{71}$ : In the case where [a taddhita affix] is elided [provided that the elision is denoted by "lup"], the gender and number [of the derivative from which they are elided] are the same as when they are

[^0]joined [to the original word]. The purpose of this sūtra is to explain why certain words that are considered to be derivatives retain the gender and number of the word from which they are derived. For example, the word Pañcäläh is masculine plural, but applies to a single janapada.

The second sūtra quoted by Dhammapāla is the subsequent sūtra 52: viśeṣanänäṃ cäjateh. ${ }^{72}$ The underlying intention of this rule is to explain that terms which qualify such derivatives agree with them except when a qualifier is a class term, e.g. janapada, in which case the class term is used in the singular, whereas an additional qualifier agrees with the latter. ${ }^{73}$

Finally, Dhammapāla might also have been expected to quote Pāṇ IV 281 : janapade lup: [the suffixes whose function is defined in IV 2 67-70] are elided [provided that the elision is denoted by "lup"] when [the dwelling-place that is denoted by the word] is a kingdom. ${ }^{74}$

We cannot know, of course, whether Buddhaghosa was actually thinking of these Pāninian sūtras when he wrote his commentary. Dhammapāla may be right when he identifies Buddhaghosa's source with Pāṇ I 2 51-52. But the possibility cannot be excluded that the actual sūtras Buddhaghosa had in mind were the following sūtras 53-55: tad aśiṣyaṃ saṃjñäpramānatvāt. lubyogäprakhyānāt. yogapramāne ca tadabhāve 'darśanaṃ syāt. In these sūtras Pānini explains why it is unnecessary to establish those complicated rules of derivation described in 51-52 in order to explain usages that in the final analysis are based on convention. ${ }^{75}$

## Papaficasūdanī

## 1 [Ps I 59,26-28 ad M I 6,27]

In this example Buddhaghosa comments upon the derivation of the city name Sāvatthī. He explains that it has this specific form because it is named after the rṣi Savattha who lived there.

Sāvatthī ti Savatthassa isino nivāsaṭthānabhūtā nagarī, yathā Kākandī, Mäkandī, [Ce v.l. adds Kosambī; Ee om., cf. Ps-pt] ti. evam akkharacintakā. ${ }^{76}$
"Sāvatthī" is a city which has status as the place where the rṣi Savattha was living, as for example Kākandī and Mākandī. This is the opinion of the grammarians.

This reference is undoubtedly to Pān IV 2 [67+] 69: tasya nivāsah: [when attached to a word the affix denoted "an" and its substitutes mean] "dwelling-place of someone", [the place being named after the person in question]. Buddhaghosa is probably also thinking of the preceding sūtra 68: tena nivṛttam: [an affix attached to a word means] "constructed by someone", [the place being named after the person in question]. The Kāsikā illustrates inter alia this rule with the following example: Kuśāmbena nirvṛttā Kauśāmbī nagarī. Dhammapāla probably

[^0]has the same rule in mind in his tīkā. ${ }^{77}$ There is no reference to rṣis in this particular context in the Pāninian tradition, but this, of course, does not exclude the assumption that Buddhaghosa is relying on Pāninian tradition for his interpretation.

Ps II 390,1-2: Kusumbassa nāma isino assamato avidūre māpitattā ti pi eke.
## 2 [Ps I 129,32-33 ad M I 24,1]

In this instance Buddhaghosa addresses the question of the function and meaning of word-repetition (āmendita $=$ sa. ämredita) as it occurs in the clause: abhikkantam bho Gotama, abhikkantam bho Gotama. In order to define the various semantic properties of ämendita, he quotes the following verse:
bhaye kodhe pasamsāyam turite kotūhalacchare
hāse soke pasāde ca kare āmenditam budho. ${ }^{78}$
An intelligent person should use word-repetition in the following meanings: [1] threat, [2] anger, [3] praise, [4] haste, [5] excitement, [6] wonder, [7] joy, [8] sorrow, and [9] satisfaction. ${ }^{79}$

Even though Buddhaghosa does not refer to grammarians or grammar in this case, the grammatical interest attached to this verse is reason enough for including it among his grammatical references.

It has not been possible to identify the source used by Buddhaghosa. The possibility cannot be excluded, however, that the verse is a Pāli adaptation of a Sanskrit verse, in which case there is good reason to believe that it represents an old kośa fragment. The verse was adopted by the compiler of the Abhidhānappadīpikā [v. Abh 107] and shows a structural similarity with many of the verses that constitute Abh. ${ }^{80}$

[^0]In any case, there is a clear relation between the various functions which the verse ascribes to ämendita and the corresponding definition of ämredita found in Pān VIII 1 [2+] 8: vākyāder āmantritasyāsūyāsammatikopakutsanabhartsaneṣu: A vocative in the beginning of a clause is repeated in the following meanings: [1] envy, [2] praise, [3] anger, [4] blame, or [5] threat. It is evident from this sūtra that the set of definitions found in the verse quoted by Buddhaghosa merely represents an elaborate version of the Pāṇinian definition.

## 3 [Ps II 389,29-390,1-2 ad M I 320,27]

In this example Buddhaghosa comments upon the derivation of the city name Kosambī. This time he does not refer explicitly to the opinion of the grammarians, but since his comment is intimately connected in subject-matter with the preceding example there is no reason to doubt that he is presenting the views of the grammarians. In addition, the specific grammatical rules upon which his comment is based can easily be traced to Pāṇinian grammar.
tattha Kosambiyan ti evamnāmake nagare. tassa hi [so read with v.l.; Ee kira] nagarassa ārāmapokkharaniädisu tesu tesu ṭhānesu kosambarukkhā va ussannā ahesum, tasmā Kosambī ti sañkham agāmasi. Kusumbassa nāma isino assamato avidüre māpitattā ti pi eke.

In this case [the locative] "in Kosambī" means in a city thus named. Because there was an abundance of Kosamba trees in various places of this city such as in the parks and by the lotus ponds or the like, it was called Kosambī. Some [grammarians] are of the


[^0]:    ${ }^{78}$ This verse is found in similar contexts in Sp 170,24-25; Sv 228,11-12 [cf. Sv-pt I 354,25 foll]; Mp II 105,25-28; Sadd 40,29.
    ${ }^{79}$ For examples of the various usages of ämendita, cf. Sv-pt I 354,25-355,7.

opinion that [it is called Kosambī] because it was constructed not far from the hermitage of the rṣi Kusamba".

There were apparently different views among grammarians about the correct derivation of Kosambī. Buddhaghosa therefore presents two altemative explanations, the first of which probably represents his own view. Both alternatives are based on two Pānini sūtras. In the first explanation he analyses Kosambī according to Pān IV 267 : tad asminn astūti deśe tannāmni: [when attached to a word the affix denoted "an" and its substitutes are used] in the sense of a place having such and such a name because such and such a thing is found in it. In the second explanation he presents the view of some scholars who apparently explained the derivation of Kosambī on the basis of Pān IV 270 : adūrabhavas ca: and [lastly a place is named after whatever is found in its] vicinity.

## Manorathapūraṇī

## 1 [Mp I 17,12-15 ad A I 1,7]

Buddhaghosa here focusses on the grammarians' definition of the meaning of the suffix -u attached to the term bhikkhu [= sa. bhikṣu; derived from the desiderative root v̄bhikṣ]. He writes:
bhikkhavo ti ämantanäkäradīpanam, tañ ca bhikkhanasīlatädigunayogasiddhattä vuttam; bhikkhanasīlatāgunayutto pi hi bhikkhu, bhikkhanadhammatāguna-
yutto pi bhikkhu, bhikkhane sādhukāritāgunayutto pī ti saddavidū mañ̃̃anti. ${ }^{81}$

The [vocative] "monks" is an encouragement in the form of an invitation (ämantanäkäradīpanam), and this [encouragement] is used because they have acquired such attributes as the habit of begging, etc. For a mendicant is either one who is in possession of the attribute that consists of the habit of begging, or one who is in possession of the quality that consists of the nature of begging, or one who is in possession of the attribute that consists of skillfulness in begging. This is the opinion of the grammarians.

The grammarians to whom Buddhaghosa refers as his source for this grammatical analysis are definitely Pāninians. The three qualities (sīlatā, dhammatā, sādhukāritā) which he enumerates in order to define the scope of meaning of the term bhikkhu are identical with those mentioned in Pān III 2 134: ā kveh tacchīlataddharmatatsādhukāriṣu: from this sūtra to sūtra 177 [the affixes that are being described are used] in the sense [of agents] having such a habit (silla) or such a nature (dharma) or such a skill (sādhukārin). This rule covers Pān III 2168 where Pānini deals with derivatives from desiderative roots and inter alia v̄bhikṣ: sanāśamsabhikṣa uh. ${ }^{82}$ It is obvious that Buddhaghosa must have had both sūtras in mind when he wrote this grammatical comment.

In this case Buddhaghosa focusses on the usage of the preposition "antarā" in the following passage: ekaṃ samayaṃ Bhagavā antarā ca Ukkaṭhaṃ antarā ca Setabbyaṃ addhānamaggapatipanno hoti: "Once Bhagavā was on his way between Ukkaṭtham and Setabbyaṃ". He continues:
antarāsaddena pana yuttattā upayogavacanaṃ kataṃ. edisesu ca ṭhānesu akkharacintakā 'antarā gāmañ ca nadiñ ca yātī' ti evaṃ ekam eva [v.l. ettha] antarāsaddam payuñjanti, so dutiyapadena pi yojetabbo hoti, ayojiyamāne upayogavacanaṃ na pāpunāati. idha pana yojetvā eva [v.l. evaṃ] vutto ti. ${ }^{83}$

Now the accusative is used because [Ukkattha and Setabbya] are construed with the word "between" (antarā). In such cases, however, the grammarians use the word "between" only once, as [e.g. in the following example]: he is on his way between the village and the river. The [word "antarā"] is surely to be construed with the second word, for if it were not construed [with it], the accusative would not obtain. And in the present case it is actually used in construction [with the second word].

[^0]This argument is only understandable on the basis of Pān II 3 [1+] 4: antarāntarena yukte: [a word] when constructed with antarā or antarena [stands in the accusative]. When constructed with two nouns the preposition antarā generally precedes and the conjunction $c a$ is put after each noun. ${ }^{84}$ This is the basic usage in Sanskrit. In Pāli the situation is slightly different, as appears from the example Buddhaghosa has chosen to comment upon. He was apparently struck by the fact that antarā is used twice in contrast to normal Sanskrit usage. But he seems to regard this anomaly as a redundant feature which only emphasises Pānini's description of the syntactical usage of antarā.

## Conclusion

The relatively few instances where Buddhaghosa refers to grammar or grammarians fall into two distinct categories: grammatical references [a] with emphasis on syntactical, morphological and derivational problems, [b] with emphasis on questions of semantics.

In the case of [a] it has been shown that practically all the references can without great difficulty be traced to particular Pāṇinian sütras. Although the possibility cannot be completely excluded that Buddhaghosa is referring to another grammar or grammatical system, it would seem extremely unlikely, in that the Pāṇinian source is well corroborated by the tikās. Buddhaghosa was obviously conversant with the Pāṇinian tradition as a whole since his references to such topics as the usage of the locative case in a causal sense [= nimittasaptam $\bar{i}],{ }^{85}$ are only understandable on the basis of Mahā-bh [+ vārttikas] ad Pān II 336. Pānini does not himself address this usage in his grammar.

In the case of [b] it is, of course, an open question whether Buddhaghosa actually refers to sa-Dhātup. There is good cause to believe that this is the case since it would be quite natural for him to make references to the collection of roots that was an indispensable part of the Pāninian grammatical system. It is, however, impossible to prove definitively that Buddhaghosa knew sa-Dhātup in its present form.

Buddhaghosa's references to grammar are not a pervasive feature in his works. Compared with the scope of his collected works they cannot, in fact, be considered an essential part of Buddhaghosa's scholarly work. But in the relatively few cases where he displays his skill as a grammarian and an interpreter, his analysis is always marked by a degree of sophistication that makes it reasonable to assume that the tradition about his elucidating the "ideas of Patañjali" (Pātañjalimata) ${ }^{86}$ in one night is founded on fact. Pātañjalimata must be identical, in fact, not with the yogasūtras as Geiger assumed ${ }^{87}$, but rather with the Mahā-bh.

Even though Buddhaghosa's references to grammar are relatively few and in several instances are applied in a way that leads one to assume that they represented a stock of grammatical explanations which he made use of in identical or analogous contexts, it is obvious that he must have assumed that the Buddhist scholars for whom he was writing were capable of identifying his references. Otherwise most of his grammatical analyses and statements about grammar would have been incomprehensible to them. Thus Buddhaghosa's references to grammar indirectly prove that the Sinhalese Buddhist scholars must have been conversant with Sanskrit and Sanskrit grammar.

It is, in fact, difficult to explain these references to Sanskrit grammar unless we assume that there was no clearly defined system of Pāli grammar in existence when Buddhaghosa was writing his

[^0]commentaries. It appears from the way in which he often presents his analyses that they were conceived as a sort of complement to the explanations embodied in the atthakathās. In such instances the grammarians' statements are sometimes contrasted with the explanations of the atthakathās. This too seems to prove that there was no full-scale Pāli grammar available to Buddhaghosa as a reference work.

To conclude, it is highly unlikely that Buddhaghosa, whose respectful attitude towards the tradition is beyond doubt, would have failed to refer to such a work, had it been in existence. There is therefore no cogent reason for assuming that there ever existed a comprehensive Pāli grammar or grammatical system prior to Kaccāyana's grammar. The fact that this, in many ways remarkable, adaptation of the Kātantra is based on a Sanskrit grammar only underlines the dependence of the Pāli grammatical tradition on Sanskrit grammar.

In a subsequent article I shall analyse references to and fragments from Pāli grammars that were presumably written in the tradition of Kaccāyana's grammar, the importance of which is beyond doubt in the development of the Sinhalese Pāli grammatical tradition.
