## THE ORIGINS

The power of speech/language ( $v \bar{a} c$ ) has intrigued Indian thinkers from the earliest times we know of. ${ }^{1}$ Words were not merely the poet's tools, not only the magic keys by which the officiating priest opened the door to prosperity and heavenly bliss: often Speech was seen as a causal force behind even the gods and the universe. The Vedic verses dealing with Speech are couched in expressions as dark and mysterious as the power they praise: "Three parts which are hidden, mortals do not activate; the fourth part they speak" guha trīni [padāni] nihitā nĕ̃gayanti turīyaṃ vāco manuşyā vadanti (Ṛgveda I 164. 45 cb ). ${ }^{2}$ When Speech was visualized as the cosmic Cow, her steps (pada) were first taken as the lines of the verse (catuspadā tristubh Tait. S. III 2, 9, 1); advanced analysis saw in her steps the single words (Sat. Br. X 2, 6, 133), and the (usually four) lines of a verse were henceforth called the 'feet' ( $p \bar{a} d a$; e.g., Ait. Br. IV 4, cf. Greek $\pi o v ́ \varsigma$ ). Aksara, originally perhaps 'the unmoving' part of the flow ( $\sqrt{k s a r}$ ) of speech, came to denote the smallest element of speech recognized at that time, i.e. the syllable whose importance for the Vedic priests lay in the syllable counting nature of their metres; ${ }^{4}$ the term became so popular

that we find it even in a rare colloquial form akhkhalikrtya 'syllabizing' in Rgveda VII 103, 3.5 The mystical speculation on the power of speech and the efficacy of a properly chanted mantra is well documented in later Vedic texts; its heirs are probably the tantric systems attested since the middle ages but almost certainly much older than that. ${ }^{6}$
The interest in language deepened in the Brāhmaṇa period. Important words were frequently explained by relating them to a verb: yad . . . aichams, tad istinām istitvam "because they wished to . . ., the offerings are called isti" (Ait. Br. I 2, 1). This etymology is 'false' because isti 'offering' is historically derived from $\sqrt{y a j}$ 'worship' and not from $\sqrt{i s}$ 'desire' (from which there is a homonym isti 'desire'); but it underscores an aspect of every offering. ${ }^{7}$ The etymology helps to fathom the full and 'real' meaning of a noun, but does not necessarily represent the 'grammatical' conviction of the author. ${ }^{8}$ In time, this kind of etymology was to develop into a special auxiliary science (vedānga) nirukta 'etymology.'
The first branch of linguistics to attain independent status was the study of phonetics. The attempt to preserve the sacred texts in a strictly oral tradition (and to preserve not only the words but also their correct pronunciation!) led to an inquiry into the production of the sounds of speech. A few terms like varna 'sound' or avasāna 'pause' appear in the earliest Brāhmaṇa-s, and at the time of the Āranyaka-s and Upaniṣad-s the science was probably fully developed (vide Ait. Ār. III 5-6, Tait. Ār. VII, Chānd. Up. II 22, 3-5). The alphabet (aksarasamämnāya) consisted of vowels (svara), stops (sparśa), semivowels (antastha for *antas-stha) and spirants (üsman). One had recognized the role of voicing ${ }^{9}$ and of mouth aperture, the nasalization of vowels and the nature of the stops as contact sounds as the name sparśa lit. 'contact' shows. Single sounds were named with an attached element -kāra 'maker' in analogy to older expressions like hin-kāra 'the sound hin' (which itself is based on still older verbal hinin akryot 'made hin' Rgveda I 164.28) or vasat-kāra 'the exclamation vasat'10: a-kāra '/a/', na-kāra '/n/' (consonant names employ an extra /a/ to facilitate pronunciation). ${ }^{11}$ It is not surprising that the new science was usually referred to as just 'the study' (siks $\bar{a}$, later sikss $\bar{a}^{12}$ ); its categories were fundamental for all further linguistic studies as was its pure interest in sounds rather than letters.

It was taught in six chapters: varna 'sound,' svara 'accent,' mātrā 'quantity,'13 bala 'articulation,' sāman 'recital' and samtāna 'connection.'14

There can be no doubt however that these insights were in due time applied to the art of writing. According to the dominant theory the Brāhmī script goes back to a North Semitic script as it was used in the eighth to sixth century B. C. ${ }^{15}$ according to others the source may have been a South Semitic script; and still others believe that the script is autochthonous. Whatever the origin, the phonetic principles of the sikṣa have been applied to this script: a separate letter (and only a single letter!) denotes each phoneme; short and long vowels are differentiated. ${ }^{15 a}$ The alphabet ${ }^{16}$ is phonetically ordered which raises it above the Semitic (and European) arbitrary arrangements. The same principles characterize various later scripts found in India and in neighbouring countries where Indian culture traveled.

A distant and unexpected echo of this script (and indirectly of the phoneticians' work) is the rise of Chinese phonetical science in the fifth or sixth century A. D. with the creation of an almost phonetical script for Chinese. By the so-called $f a n^{2}$-ch $i e h^{4}$ principle original word signs are used to denote initial and final consonants alone, e.g. $k u^{1}$ plus san ${ }^{1}$ together denote $k a n^{1}$; the inspirational source was the Indian siddha-script used for charms by the Chinese Buddhists. ${ }^{17}$ The Korean onmun-script (announced by royal proclamation in the year A.D. 1446; note the alphabetical order: k kh ng t th n p ph m . . .) is a further (maybe indirect) reflex ${ }^{18}$ as also the disputed Ahiru-script of Japan. ${ }^{19}$ In the west, Indian influence on the Arabic grammarian Halīl (eighth century A.D.) at Basra

In metrics an open syllable with a short vowel has 1 mātrā, a closed syllable and a syllable with long vowel 2 mātrā-s. The length of agāt would be phonetically $1+1 / 2+2+1 / 3=4$ mātrā-s, metrically $1+2=3$ mātrā-s.
    ${ }^{14}$ Tait. Ār., ch. VII. samtāna is probably the later samdhi. The discovery of sandhi was utilized early in mystical speculation; the sacred syllable om is allegedly made up of three elements: $a+u+m>o m$ (Ait. Br. V 32, 2).

is almost certain: there is no other explanation for his adoption of a phonetic alphabet. ${ }^{20}$ The Indian influence on modern European phonetics is well documented; in the words of J.R. Firth: "Without the Indian grammarians and phonsticians ... it is difficult to imagine our nineteenth century school of phonetics.' ${ }^{21}$

The beginning of grammar was linked to god Indra. We read in Tait. Samh. VI $4,7,3$ :
vāg vai parācy avyākrtāvadat; te devā Indram abruvann imām no vācam vyākurv iti . . tām Indro madhyato 'vakramya vyäkarot . . "Speech spoke turned away, inarticulate. The gods said to Indra: 'Articulate this speech for us!' . . . Indra entered in the midst of it and articulated it."
Indra's involvement with grammar is later attested in the Mahābhāsya (I 5, 25f.: pupil of Bṛhaspati) while in the classical period it is always Siva who bestows grammatical wisdom (see below p. 92 fn .24 ).

Grammar was not a pure science; it was linked with the ritual duties of the priests who developed it. An example is the discovery of the cases in noun inflection and how it was used to make the ritual more sophisticated. In the ceremony of the repeated kindling of the fire (punarādheya or punarādhāna) a cake is offered to Agni with six verses taken from the Rgveda. A condition is imposed that each verse must contain the name Agni in a different case form, as the varied incantation is more powerful. The term for 'case,' vibhaktilit. 'distinction,' has been retained in later grammatical literature; but while it originally belonged to the root $\sqrt{b h a j}}$ 'divide, share' (Ait. Br. I. 1; VII 1), later authors sometimes derived it from $\sqrt{b h a \tilde{n} j}$ 'bend' (Kātantra-vṛtti II 1, 2; III 1, 1,; cf. our 'inflection').

Even though the verb was not yet recognized as a class, the categories 'future' (karişyat; Ait. Br. IV 29, 3, etc.), 'present' (kurvat; Ait. Br. IV 31, 3) and 'past' (krta; Ait. Br. V 1, 3) ${ }^{22}$ were applied to verbal forms. This allowed for no distinction between the different forms of the past (imperfect, aorist, perfect); it grouped the imperative with the future tense-in short, there was no attempt to describe the complicated structure of the Sanskrit verb. But the three time categories were there to stay-under different names. The later Brāhmaṇa-s and the S̄āṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka have bhavisyat, bhavat and bhūta instead. ${ }^{23}$ With one more replacement, Pānini has the definite set of bhavisyat, vartamāna and bhūta.

    ${ }^{21}$ J.R. Firth, TPS 1946.119.
    ${ }^{22}$ Kauśītakī Brāhmaṇa XXII 3 has cakrvas instead, possibly because the part. perf. pass. krta could be interpreted as the name of the root $k r$ : G.B. Palsule, JUP 29.20. It is more likely that Kauśitakī Brāhmaṇa XXII 3 replaced krta with cakrvas because thus all three terms became active participles.
    ${ }^{23}$ Cf. the discussion in Mahābhāsya I 254, 13-156, 27 on whether roots denote kriy $\bar{a}$ or $b h \bar{a} v a$.
It became clear at this time that many words belonged together as members of a word family, even if the exact nature of their relation was yet unknown. Due to the absence of a derivational hierarchy we find a motley group of head words. In the Ait. Br. the part. perf. pass. leads with about $50 \%$, with agent nouns, action nouns, an adjective, an imperative, a third pers. sing. and a naked root ${ }^{24}$ sharing the rest. These forms are used with a suffix -vat 'having [. . .]' which derives from a priestly praxis to refer to a verse that contains e.g. the word pra as pra-vat 'having pra' (Ait. Br. I 10, 1). jāta-vat is thus the head word for a wide variety of words derived from the root $\sqrt{\text { jan }}$, and mahad-vat for words like mahām, mahas, etc. In the Kauś. Br. the part. perf. pass. covers $90 \%$ of the instances.

The final redaction of the Vedic Samhitä-s ${ }^{25}$ reveals the influence of grammatical thought in the mistaken extension of hiatus after the pronominal forms asme 'us' and yusme 'you' in analogy to the dual forms ending in $-e$, and in the compromise sandhi form [devās]o a[pturah] Rgveda I 3, 8, etc. Because the Brāhmaṇa-s sometimes still quote the Rgveda words in their original pre-redaction form it can be assumed that the redactors' work extended into the early Brāhmaṇa period; ${ }^{26}$ for all later authors the forms given in the sacred Saṃhitā-s are beyond dispute.

Major achievements were the Pada-pātha-s 'word-for-word recitations' to the Vedic Saṃhitā-s, probably in the sequence Sāma-veda, Rg-veda, Atharvaveda, Yajur-veda (first referred to possibly Ait. Br. V 4, 3 and certainly Ait. $\bar{A} r$. III 2, 6). ${ }^{27}$ The Pada-pātha of the Rgveda is ascribed to a Vedamitra Śākalya. The whole text is broken up into its elements: sandhi between words is dissolved, compounds are split up by inserting a pause between their members. Even certain case suffixes are separated from the stem, i.e. those suffixes before which the stem undergoes the same morphophonemic changes as between words: vacobhir (Rgveda I 187, 11; instr. pl. of vacas) appears as vacah/ /bhih as against the instr. sg. vacas $\bar{a}$. A late echo of this practice is found in Pānini's grammar where the noun stem before these suffixes is called pada 'word.' Occasionally the Pada-pātha replaces extinct forms with those more familiar, e.g. uṣāsam (Rgveda IV 3, 11) with uṣasam and etana (Rgveda V 61, 4) with itana. The Pada-pātha-s never achieved a status similar to the Saṃhitā-pātha;

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ mad-vat (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa III 29, 2, etc.) may have been taken from the compound soma-mad; in any case it comes close to the notion of the root.
    ${ }^{25}$ This is really a short form for samhitā-pātha 'recitation in connected speech' contrasting it with the later Pada-pātha (below). From sentences like pada-prakṛtih samhitā "The samhitā [recitation] is made up from the word [-for-word recitation]" (Nirukta I 17 and Rgveda-prātiśākhya II 1) samhitā could be taken to denote the text itself.

scholars occasionally disagreed with their analysis and did not hesitate to say so. ${ }^{28}$

Towards the end of the Vedic period there were thus three branches of linguistic study: phonetics (šiks $\bar{a}$ ), etymology (nirukta) and grammar (vyākaraña); but their oldest systematical works have not survived the hazards of oral tradition. The relative chronology of the preserved texts allows no inference on the genesis of the science. Inner logic as well as indirect testimony suggest that phonetics were the basis for the other two branches; actually phonetics and phonology are taken for granted by all authorities of etymology and grammar. This is especially clear in the sound table of Pānini's grammar which is based on the grouping worked out by the phoneticians.

The list of phonemes was more or less settled at an early time and what debates have survived deal only with such minor points as the status of visarga, anusvāra and other allophones ${ }^{29}$ and with the question if $/ 1 /$ needs to be listed or can be accounted for as a rare substitute for $/ \mathrm{r} / .{ }^{30}$ The sound table is generally phonemic and its authors deserve high praise for that; but it should be noted that at least one allophone ( $/ \bar{n} /$ ) has slipped into the phonemic flock. Besides the vowels, semivowels and sibilants, the centre piece of the alphabet is the so-called pañca pañca-vargāh [Rgveda-prātisāakhya I 2(8)], the 'five groups of five':

|  | Voiceless Stops |  |  | Voiced Stops |  | Nasals |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | 1. tenuis | 2. aspirata | 3. media | 4. media aspir. | 5. nasal |  |
| guttural | k | kh | g | gh |  | n |
| palatal | c | ch | j | jh |  | (ñ) |
| retroflex | t | th | d | dh |  | n |
| dental | t | th | d | dh |  | n |
| labial | p | ph | b | bh |  | m |

The places of articulation (sthāna) move forward from throat (guttural) to lips (labial); the efforts of voicing and aspiration as well as the absence of them are well grouped. It seems that the beauty of the scheme led to the inclusion of $/ \bar{n} /$ which is really nothing but a predictable allophone in Sanskrit (cf. the correspondence loc. sg. nāmani/nāmni vs. rā̄ani/rājñi). ${ }^{31}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{28}$ L. Renou, Introduction générale, p. 37.
    ${ }^{29}$ Kātyāyana, vārttika 6 and 7 on Sivasūtra 5, proposes to include these sounds; his suggestion is adopted in the larger recension of the Jainendra grammar, the Sākaṭāyana grammar, and other grammatical works.
    ${ }^{30}$ A variance in the phonetical description of $/ \mathrm{r} /$ (retroflex or dental) may reflect the historical fate of $/ \mathrm{r} /$ in its relation to $/ 1 /$.
    ${ }^{31}$ M.B. Emeneau, Lg 22.86-93. [n] lacks contrastive value (there is no guna besides gunal) but is predictable only in part of its occurences-and hence is not an allophone but a phoneme.
Every grammatical description presupposes some primitive etymology, if only to recognize that gacchati 'goes,' jagāma 'went' and gatih 'gait' have a phoneme group and a notion in common. Etymology taken in this limited role may with Yāska 'neglect the formation' (na samskāram ādriyeta, Nirukta II 1). But etymology was not seen merely as a preliminary stage of grammatical analysis to be dropped later. It was as Yāska said 'the complement of grammar' (vyākaraṇasya kārtsnyam, Nirukta I 15); a student is warned not to discuss his science with somebody who is ignorant of grammar (nirbrūyāt . . . nâvaiyākaraṇāya, Nirukta II 3). We have to ask what this special contribution of nirukta was and why this branch of linguistics later became atrophic. Both questions are closely related.

The Sanskrit word for grammar ${ }^{32}$ is vyākaraṇa lit. 'separation, distinction' (cf. Śat. Br. XIII 8, 2, 2 daivaṃ caiva tat pitryaṃ ca vyākaroti "He keeps separate what refers to the gods and what refers to the fathers''). ${ }^{33}$ Grammar distinguishes roots, suffixes, and prefixes and assigns each of the latter to a meaning or function. The interest is centered on forming correct words and sentences from these basic elements so that the intended meaning is expressed. The nirukta proceeds in the opposite direction: it explains words, especially Vedic words, by tracing the root or verb they are derived from. ${ }^{34}$ This process is called nirvacana 'explicit mention [of the root/verb]': in the Brāhmaṇa-s a verse was called $a$-nirukta if the praised god is not named in it. ${ }^{35}$ There is no interest in the formation of the word as long as it appears to be common and even if it is not, the etymology can proceed on the basis of the meaning alone with only the slightest formal support:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{32}$ Kātyāyana, in vārttika 14 of his introduction, defines grammar as the sum of 'characterized [words]' and 'characterizing [rules]': laksya-laksane vyākaraṇam. For Patañjali (Mahābhāṣya I 1, 19) and Bhartṛhari (Vākyapadīya I 11) grammar is the foremost of the six auxiliary Vedic sciences (vedānga lit. 'limb of the Veda'); the others are phonetics, metrics, etymology, astronomy and ceremonial. One has to remember that in the Indian way of speaking man has six limbs: arms, legs, head and sex organ. The Mīmāṃsā disputed the claim of grammar to be a vedānga as e.g. Kumārila, Tantravārttika on I 6.3, 18-27 regards it only as smrti; cf. also K.C. Chatterji, JDLCU 24 (pt. 3), 1-21, summarized in J.F. StaAl, A Reader, p. 289.
    ${ }^{33}$ P. Thieme explains vyākaraṇa as '[word-] formation': vividhena prakārenākrtayah kriyante yena; the sacred language is thus 'built up' or 'prepared' (samskrta): Studies . . . Fs. J. Whatmough, ('s-Gravenhage, 1957), p. 267-269. G. B. Palsule, JUP 29.26-29, contrasts vyā-kr 'to divide, analyse' and sams-kr 'to join, to synthesize, to form;' but he renders vācaṃ vyākaroti (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 5.1) with 'utters speech' (p. 27, fn. 38). Cf. above p. 80.

Lakshman Sarup] (Hoshiarpur, 1954) p. 68-79. Even a grammarian like Patañjali occasionally availed himself of the nirukta technique, e.g. Mahābhāṣya I 206, 24 svayam rājante: svarāh "They shine by themselves: therefore they are called vowels (svara)."
artha-nityah parīksetakena cid vṛtti-sāmānyena.avidyamāne sāmānye 'pyakṣara-var-na-sāmānyān nirbrūyāt, na tv eva na nirbrūyāt. na samskāram ādriyeta, viśayavatyo vṛttayo bhavanti" . . examine them with regard to their meaning by the analogy of some [common] course of action. If there be no [such] analogy one should explain them even by the community of a [single] syllable or sound, but one should never give up [the attempt at] derivation. One should not attach importance to the grammatical formation, for these complex formations are subject to exceptions" (Nirukta II 1).
Looking at the noun forms kartre 'doer' (dat. sg.), karma 'deed' (nom. sg.) and krtim 'doing' (acc. sg.) the etymologist would be satisfied to 'explicitly mention' the verb karoti 'does' in order to settle the basic meaning of the nouns; the task of the grammarian would just have begun-but his interest in the notion of 'doing' would be small. This becomes clear in the lists of motivations we find in two prominent works of the two schools. According to Yāska one should study nirukta in order to grasp the precise meaning of the Vedic stanzas; whoever does not understand the meaning cannot conduct a thorough investigation of accent and grammatical form, nor can he understand the word divisions of the Pada-pātha; the attributes of the Vedic gods (e.g. archaic tvisita 'shining') reveal their meaning only to the etymologist (Nirukta I 15 and 17). The grammarian is motivated in his study by his desire to guard the precise form of the Veda; to adapt the Vedic formulae to the people he is serving as a priest; because grammar is the most concise summary of the language; because it decides doubtful interpretations; because it is his duty (Mahābhāṣya I 1, 14-2, 2). ${ }^{36}$ We understand now why the oldest grammar we have, Pānini's Aṣṭādhyāyī, avoids references to meaning as far as possible and why Pānini's root list (dhātu-pātha) originally was without lexical meanings. But there was a change later; sometime between Patañjali and Candragomin meanings were attached to the roots and thus grammars became complete language manuals. Etymology was retained in the schools of Veda interpretation, but there were no recasts of Yāska's classic work, let alone new nirukta-s for the Prakrits or other Indian languages.

What little we know about the period just preceding the great treatises comes from casual remarks in later texts, especially Yāska's Nirukta. The most important discovery was no doubt the 'root.' It did not come easy or in one step. The Nighanțu, an old list of rare Vedic words, gave nouns and verbs separate; particles and adverbs also were grouped together. The idea of a root was hazy at best: several times we find even different verb forms of the same root listed side by side. The most common form of quoting verbs was the $3^{\text {rd }}$ sg. (jvalati, etc.) which was found first in the Ait. Br. (V 20, 4, 8) and which has stayed on as an alternative mode of reference in all later grammatical literature.

The unclear conception is reflected in an equally unclear terminology: ākhyāta lit. 'told' is commonly used for the verb, while dhātu lit. 'part, element'37 is

sometimes found in the same sense, but more often in the sense of the abstract entity called 'root.' A third use 'present tense stem' can be inferred from the Pāṇinian terms sārvadhātuka 'suffix attached to the whole stem' (e.g. [bhava-]ti) and $\bar{a} r d h a d h a ̄ t u k a$ 'suffix attached to the halfstem = root (e.g. [a-bh $\bar{u}-] t$ ) before which a piece of the stem bhava- is as it were cut off to get $b h \bar{u}$-. An indication of how complex the problem is, is in Yāska's statement:
tatra nāmāny ākhyāta-jānīti Śākaṭāyano nairukta-samayaś ca "Amongst them the nouns are derived from the $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$; so says Śākaṭāyana and the doctrine of the etymologists" (Nirukta I 12).
Did Śākaṭāyana derive the nouns from verbs? Or did he use $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ for 'root'? If he did, the anonymous author quoted in the Mahābhāsya (II 138, 14 and 16) was right when he said in his own terminology:
nāma ca dhātu-jam āha Nirukte, vyākaraṇe Śakaṭasya ca tokam "The noun is derived from the root; so he said in the Nirukta and [so said] in grammar the offspring of Śakaṭa."
Śākaṭāyana who evidently had claimed that all nouns are derived from $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$-s, is opposed by others: na sarvānīti Gārgyo vaiyākaraṇānām caike "Not all—thus [say] Gārgya and some of the grammarians" (Nirukta I 12). From these sentences it is clear that Śākaṭāyana was not an etymologist but a grammarian; ${ }^{38}$ and that Gārgya was not a grammarian-but Gārgya cannot have been an etymologist either because the etymologists subscribed all to the doctrine of general derivability. ${ }^{39}$ Since a Gārgya is credited by tradition with the creation of the Pada-pāṭha of the Sāmaveda, the conclusion is plausible that the Gārgya mentioned by Yāska was a follower of the $\bar{s} i k s \bar{a}$. His influence on some grammarians was of great consequence because Pāṇini followed him rather than Śākaṭāyana (cf. below p. 104).

Another famous controversy goes back to this period: do prefixes have a meaning of their own (so Gārgya) ${ }^{40}$ or do they merely illustrate (dyotaka) a meaning contained in the root (so Śākaṭāyana)? This debate, reported in Nirukta I 3, has later continued in the grammatical literature. ${ }^{41}$ Pāṇini again seems to

[^0]:    ${ }^{38}$ According to an old saying, he would have been the founding father of grammar: anu Śākataāyanaṃ vaiyākaraṇāh "All grammarians are followers of Śākaṭāyana" (Kāśikā on Pāṇini I 4 86); cf. Yudhiṣṭhr Mīmāmsak, Saṃskṛt vyākaraṇ kā itihās, I (1963), p. 162f. Patañjali (Mahābhāsya II 120, 20f.) has an anecdote that Śākaṭāyana was so immersed in thought that he did not notice a passing caravan of carts (śakaṭa); the play on his name may well have been the cause of the story. In a verse quoted in Mahābhāsya II 138.16 he is called the 'offspring of Śakaṭa.' Śākaṭāyana admitted only one root per noun (i.e. root +suffixes) while others used up to three roots to explain a single word, e.g. hrdayam 'heart' from $\gamma^{\prime} h r+\gamma^{\prime} d \bar{a}+\gamma^{\prime} y a m$ (Śat. Br. XIV 8, 4, 1).

follow Gārgya because he specifies in I 493 adhi-pari anarthakau "adhi and pari when they are meaningless;" this restriction is only appropriate if they usually are meaningful.

Grammatical analysis in itself was challenged by thinkers like Audumbarāyana for whom the sentence was the linguistic unit; the reference to words in grammar is valid only because they allow a complete and convenient way to handle the language. ${ }^{42}$

Although Pānini and Yāska mention a good number of previous scholars on grammar, etymology and phonetics (Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya are mentioned by both ${ }^{43}$ ), we know very little about them. ${ }^{44}$ Works running under their name are spurious ${ }^{45}$ and alleged quotations in the later commentatorial literature are as a rule highly suspect. ${ }^{46}$ Their insights were assimilated by their followers, but their compositions were lost when the classical works of Pānini and Yāska rose above the previous literature. ${ }^{47}$ Oral tradition knows no mercy for outdated knowledge.

The scholarly literature of this period developed a new style which calls for some comments. ${ }^{48}$ The new texts called sūtra-s 'threads' aimed at extreme precision and brevity; their single sentences, likewise called sūtra-s, reduced or eliminated finite verb forms and dependent clauses. Often they attained further economy by dittoing expressions that normally would be repeated in several

Kielhorn, IA 16.101 f.). Such explanations should be viewed like other suggestions pointing out a possible cause for the apparent anomaly, not a statement of fact. cekrīyita 'intensive middle' (Mahābhāsya II 232, 5 in a quote) is explained by Kaiyaṭa as a term of the pūrvācārya-s but in Nirukta VI 22 carkarita (which denoted an active intensive in II 28) comprises the middle as well: this makes cekrīyita a later fabrication (L. Renou, JA 233.156 fn. 2). For a possible pre-Pāṇinian $a u^{a}$ (in Pāṇ. VII 1 18) 'nom./acc. dual -au' pleads M.D. Balasubrammanyam, JUP 25.77-82.

But the prevailing dogma of śabda-nityatva 'permanence of speech sounds' must accept all these forms as equally correct. For the later commentators (Kāśikā, etc.) such rules are just optional and the use of names (instead of the shorter $v \bar{a}$ 'or') serves to honour earlier scholars.

consecutive sentences (anuvrtti). This made it easier to memorize whole textbooks but made interpretation more problematic. The memorized sūtra was accompanied by the teacher's interpretation that 'fleshed out' the skeleton information supplied in the sūtra. This puts us at a disadvantage as we generally lack such an authentic interpretation. Because the teacher's interpretation was not as rigidly recorded as the sūtra-s and because the wording of the sūtra-s is often ambiguous, inner developments in a school could creep into the traditional interpretation almost unnoticed; sometimes different branches of a school gave different interpretations of the same sūtra.

The name for this style is taken from the image of weaving where a thread is stretched out lengthwise as a warp to be crossed by the woof. ${ }^{49}$ The warp may be one continuing thread or it may be cut on both sides of the frame: this explains the use of sūtra for both the whole work and its sentences. The sūtra is thus a stripped textus. This explanation is supported by the parallel case of tantra 'thread, text' with its counterpart $\bar{a} v \bar{a} p a$ 'insertion.' In liturgical texts one discerns a) the special feature of a ritual (pradhāna) and b) the auxiliary rites that accompany various rituals in an identical manner (anga): from a strictly formal point of view the ancient ritualists could call these auxiliary rites which turn up again and again, the warp (tantra) and the main rite which varies from ritual to ritual, the woof ( $\bar{a} v \bar{a} p a) .^{50}$

Others have suggested that the underlying image is that of a necklace held together by a thread; this explanation leaves the double use of sūtra for 'text' and 'sentence' unexplained. W.

## PĀṆINI

Pānini is not only the oldest grammarian whose work has come down to us-he is also the greatest. His full name was Dāksīputra Pānini (Mahābhāsya I 75,13 and III 251, 12 in a quoted verse) in the common style which added a metronymic to the name itself. Even though in the old times the father's caste alone decided the caste of a son (cf. the story in Chānd. Up. IV 4), it could only increase a Brahmin's prestige if he could point out the equally high caste of his mother. ${ }^{1}$ Pānini's date can be fixed only approximately; he must be older than Kātyāyana (c. 250 B.C.) who in his comments on Pānini's work refers to other still earlier scholars dealing with Pānini's grammar; his proximity to the Vedic language as found in the Upaniṣad-s and Vedic sūtra-s ${ }^{2}$ suggests the $5^{\text {th }}$ or maybe $6^{\text {th }}$ c. B.C. ${ }^{3}$ His home was the town of Salātura ${ }^{4}$ in ancient Gandhāra (northwest India), modern Lāhur in the angle where the Kabul River and the Indus meet, about 20 miles northwest of strategic Attock Bridge. Outside Lāhur, there are now some high mounds which likely contain ancient sites. The Chinese monk Hsüan-tsang visited the city in the $7^{\text {th }}$ c. A.D. "To the north-west of U-to-kia-han-c'ha (i.e. Attock), 20 li or so, we come to the town of So-lo-tu-lo (Salātura). This is the place where the Ṛ̇̄i Pānini, who composed the Ching-ming-lun (vyäkarana), was born." ${ }^{5} \mathrm{He}$ retold also a Buddhist legend in which a

    ${ }^{3}$ There is no shortage of inconclusive arguments. V.S. Agrawala, India as known to Pānini (Lucknow, 1953), p. 380-383, assumes that the word maskarin 'carrying a bamboo cane $>$ religious mendicant' in VI 154 refers to Makkhali Gosāliputta the older contemporary of the Buddha and advocate of determinism, but the rule implies no reference to a certain person. If P.H.L. Eggermont, Persica 4.88-97 is right in fixing the date of Buddha's death at 384 B.C. instead of 484 B.C. the dates of some Vedic texts (and along with them Pānini) could come down a hundred years.

Brahmin claims that there was even a statue of Pāṇini in existence. Pāṇini's origin in the extreme Northwest explains several peculiarities of his grammar. He describes in minute detail features of the area as e.g. the different accents in the names of wells north and south of the river Vipāś (IV 273,74 cf. below p. 108), while he limits himself to the larger geographical features of other parts of India. Furthermore, he shows great familiarity with the Vedic texts found in the North and West (notably certain branches of the Black Yajurveda), but never quotes forms from the White Yajurveda belonging to the East. ${ }^{6}$ As the province Gandhāra was an Achaemenian satrapy from the time of Darius to the end of his dynasty, Pānini must have been a Persian subject at least in name, ${ }^{7}$ but his work shows no trace of it. ${ }^{8}$

Pāṇini's grammar, the Aṣtādhyāyī 'The Eight Chapters,' is composed in a most concise sūtra style and consists of a little under 4000 sūtra-s. The exact number varies depending on our judgement of a few interpolations and 'sūtrasplittings.' Most of the interpolations were originally vārttika-s of Kātyāyana or are at least based on Kātyāyana's or Patañjali's remarks; more frequently only the wording of a sūtra has been altered or enlarged on the basis of such remarks. As only the text in continuous recitation (samhitā-pätha) is authoritative, the Pāṇinīya-s often resorted to dividing a sūtra into two or even three: it allowed them to reinterpret the rules without actually altering them. ${ }^{9}$

Our vulgate text is the one explained in the Kāśikā-vṛtti ( $7^{\text {th }}$ c. A.D.); it is about 20 sūtra-s longer than the text known to Kātyāyana or Patañjali. ${ }^{10}$ The fate of the text before Kātyāyana is not known. It seems that the oral tradition suffered some interruption, for the technical accents and nasalizations which are an essential element of Pānini's metalanguage were lost and already Kātyāyana probably had to infer their existence from the context or from the results,

    8 Of no historical value are the legends about Pānini in later literature such as the Pañcatantra (ed. G. Bühler) II 33, Kathāsaritsāgara I 4, 20-25 or Haracaritacintāmaṇi XXVII [ed. \& tr. J. Brough, Selections from classical Sanskrit Literature (London, 1951), p. 2-21]; some poetical works attributed to him are really products of the late Middle Ages (F. Kielhorn, GGN 1885.185f.).
    ${ }^{9}$ F. Kielhorn, IA 15.203 counts 3983 sūtra-s (cf. the numbering in BöHTLINOK's edition); L. Renou, La Durghatavṛtti (Paris, 1940), vol. I, 1, p. 10, totals 3996 sūtra-s. It was of course impossible to recite a whole adhyāya or even a pāda without interruption. How do we account then for the assumed continuous recitation? Did the Aṣtādhyāyī go through a stage of written tradition in which accents and nasalizations were lost and all rules subjected to sandhi (P.Thieme, Pānini and the Veda, p. $120-124$ )?
    ${ }^{10}$ F. Kielhorn, IA 16.178-184. The enigmatic sūtra-s I 2 53-57 with their argumentative style must be an interpolation, and their tenets point to a different school of thought. As only the first of them is commented on and mentioned in the Mahābhāsya (Patañjali only), it is likely that the others got into the text later; Patañjali could otherwise hardly have avoided any comment on them [B. Faddegon, Studies on Pānini's grammar (Amsterdam, 1936), p. 57-59; L. Renou, JA 233.115 fn. 3; G. B. Palsule, ABORI 30.135-144].
i. e. the known forms of the Sanskrit language. ${ }^{11}$ In his remarks on I 41 Patañjali mentions a variant reading: I 41 was read both as $\bar{a} k a d \bar{a} r a \bar{a} d$ eka $\bar{a} \operatorname{sam} \bar{\imath} \bar{n} \bar{a}$ and as prāk kadärāt paraṃ kāryam (Mahābhāsya I 296, 11 f.). ${ }^{12}$ Besides the 1713 sūtra-s discussed in the Mahābhāsya, many others are incidentally mentioned in it, thus providing testimony of their existence. We have no reason to doubt the basic validity of our Pānini text; its limitations are in the phonetic presentation.

The loss of the technical accents ${ }^{13}$ and nasalizations ${ }^{14}$ was already mentioned. Other changes may have been caused by written fixation of the text. The technical language had-due to a combination of determinatives with suffixes of the Sanskrit language-a number of unusual consonant clusters: ${ }^{k} v \bar{a},{ }^{c} P H a^{6}$, etc. In many instances, the clusters were so unfamiliar to the Sanskrit speaker that he heard a hint of a vowel: $s s^{c}, t_{s} T H a^{n},{ }^{n} a m s^{1}$, tass (but $t r a^{1}$ !), ${ }^{15}$ etc. Whether Pānini consciously used an auxiliary vowel to facilitate pronunciation (uccāranărtham) ${ }^{16}$ or whether it originated in the mind of the listener we do not know. ${ }^{17}$ If the latter was the case, a serious problem must have arisen when the grammar was put down in writing: we find the three short vowels $(a, i, u)^{18}$ used with no apparent reason for their distribution except that the same vowel is used for a certain suffix in all its occurrences ( $t i T H a^{p},{ }^{n} a m u^{1}$ ). In one case the new vocalization led to a secondary differentiation: the suffix $s^{c}$ was rendered as $s u^{c}$ when attached to numerals (e.g. $d v i-s$ ) but as $s i^{c}$ when used as an aorist marker ( $a k \bar{a} r-s \bar{s} t$ ) even though it had the same formal characteristics. ${ }^{19}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ F. Kielborn, Gurupūjākaumudī [Fs. A. Weber], p. 32. Many Vedic texts now without accent marks have suffered a similar loss. The loss of technical nasalization meant that the abbreviation $s^{k p}$ for all case suffixes from $s^{6}$ to $s u^{p}$ (I 4 14) became a homonym of the loc. pl. suffix $s u^{p}$.
    ${ }^{12}$ Similarly III 2134 a ${ }^{k} V E s$ tacchila-taddharma-tatsādhukārişu is also read prāk ${ }^{k} V E s \ldots$ (Mahābhāsya II 135, 19f.). Occasionally Patañjali and repeatedly the Kāsikā ascribe such variant readings or alternative interpretations to Pānini himself (V.S. Agrawala, India as known to Pānini, p. 30f.).

    ${ }^{14}$ One is surprised at first to see the nasal pronuncation retained in the rule I 1 17/18 $u^{6} a \bar{u} \tilde{n}$; the obvious reason is that this $\bar{u} \tilde{n}$ is not a technical form of Pānini's but a quotation from the well known Padapāṭha of the Rgveda (P. Thieme, Pānini and the Veda, p. 129).

    ${ }^{17}$ Inspite of a superficial similarity, the genesis and distribution of these vowels is different from the 'vowel bits' (svara-bhakti) employed in the later recitation of Vedic texts (below p. 131).
    ${ }^{18}$ The non-utilization of $r$ and $l$ points to a time when these vowels had disappeared from vernacular speech.
    ${ }^{19}$ H. Scharfe, Pānini's metalanguage (Philadelphia, 1971), p. 7-9.
Finally, Pānini had a unique way to indicate the short, long or protracted duration of a vowel: he likened it to the crow of a cock: "The short, long and protracted [vowel] respectively have the length of $u, \bar{u}, \bar{u} 3 .{ }^{\prime 20}$ There was no proper way to put down the last imitative sound in writing and the three vowels were contracted into a single long /ū/: $\bar{u}$-kälo 'j-jhrasva-dirgha-plutah (I 2 27); the commentators from Kātyāyana on had to reach the true form by logical deduction.

Pānini's grammar was clearly meant to be memorized before it could be studied as any operation or definition involves numerous leaps from chapter to chapter, forward and backward. And indeed it was the custom for students to learn the grammar by heart at a tender age before the teacher explained its application. ${ }^{21}$ To the uninitiated the first impression is one of organized chaos. This is largely due to a constant struggle between two principles: logical grouping and technical economy. While the logic of things has settled the basic structure of the work, the quest for economy often prevailed in its execution. Besides, there are numerous associative digressions that disrupt the basic scheme. L. Renou ${ }^{22}$ has pointed out that Kātyāyana's proposals if inserted into the grammar at their points of reference would create much the same picture, and he has concluded that these digressions (or at least many of them) may be interpolations and indicate the gradual growth of the grammar. I would add that these interpolations are probably the work of Pānini himself. The theory that Pānini was only the last in a line of redactors of a traditional text ${ }^{23}$ lacks proof and even probability because many of the 'interpolations' are indispensable parts of any Sanskrit grammar.

[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ Nāgojībhatṭa's explanation: " $a$, etc. are not given because the quantity of 1,2 and 3 measures is established for the $u$-sound crowed by cocks" (kukkuta-rute ukāre eka-dvi-tri-mātratva-prasiddher akārādayo nōktāh Laghuśabdenduśekhara on I 2 27, KSS no. 128, p. 67) is based on Viṭthala's commentary of the Prakriyākaumudī I 2 27, BSPS no. 78, p. 21: "Because the status of 1,2 and 3 measures is established in the $u$-sound in the cock's crowing the author of the sūtra used the $u$-sound setting the $a$-sound aside." Otherwise Indian phoneticians have compared the length of speech sounds to that of typical sounds of different animals: "A blue jay cries one measure, a crow two measures; a peacock should be recognized as having three measures" [Rgveda-prātiśākhya XIII 20(50)]. Cf. B. Liebich, Einführung in die indische einheimische Sprachwissenschaft II (Heidelberg, 1919), p. 42, and P. Thieme, Pānini and the Veda, p. 125 f.; not convincing G. Cardona, Lg. 41.236 f . The pitches of the 7 musical notes are measured against animal sounds, from a peacock's cry to the trumpeting of an elephant [Nārada Sikṣā, ŚS, p. 407, quoted by S.

The grammar proper is preceded by a sound table ${ }^{24}$ based on the old phonemic alphabet worked out by the šiksā. Pānini reduced the vowels ( $a, \bar{a}, i, \bar{i}$, etc.) to their types ( $a, i$, etc.) comprising all varieties by duration, accent, nasalization, etc. The original sequence of sounds was modified in several ways; then the list was broken up into 14 sections, each with another consonant as end marker. This arrangement enabled the author to form groups almost at will by combining a sound of the list with an end marker further down: this combination comprises all sounds down to (and excluding) the end marker, e.g. in the sūtra-s $1 a i u^{2} 2 r l^{k}$ the abbreviation $a^{u}$ would denote the vowels $a, i, u$, the abbreviation $i^{k}$ the vowels $i, u, r, l$. This is done by a process of contraction called samähāra 'gathering' introduced in rule I 171 , ādir āntyena sahêtāa "The beginning with the determinative that is last." Short labels thus denote whole classes: $h a^{i}$ all consonants, $y a^{r}$ all consonants except $/ \mathrm{h} /, k h a^{y}$ all voiceless stops, etc.

These formulae are used frequently in the grammar as in the very first sūtra of the grammar proper: vrddhir $\bar{a}^{d}$-ai ${ }^{c}$ "[When I say] vrddhi [I mean] $\bar{a}, a i, a u$." In this rule the usual word order has been inverted to obtain an auspicious beginning: vrddhi means ordinarily 'growth, prosperity.' This is taken up at the end of the grammar with the expression udaya which ordinarily means 'success' but here is used in the meaning of 'following.' ${ }^{25}$ The very last sūtra VIII 468 $a a$ reverts to the sound table at the beginning: it corrects an assumption made throughout the grammar-that the short /a/ is phonetically homorganic with the long / $\bar{a} /$. After we have used $/ \mathrm{a} /$ as just a short open $a$, we now learn that its phonetic value is that of a closed $a$. The phonemic oppositions contrast with the phonetic ones more in this way:

[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ The old name for it is pratyāhāra-sūtra-s 'contraction/summation rules'; under the influence of Kashmirian Saivism, the names siva-sūtra-s and māhesvara-sūtra-s became popular [K.M.K. SARMA, Pānini Kātyāyana and Patañjali (Delhi, 1968), p. 32-36].
    ${ }^{25}$ This sūtra VIII 467 nödätta-svaritōdayam . . (neglecting the names that follow) is by the way a sloka line (it occurs as such in Rgveda-prātisākhya III 9d and 12d) just like the first two sūtra-s I 1 1-2 vṛddhir $\bar{a}^{d}-a i^{c}, a^{d}-e^{h}$ guṇah taken together. The Aṣṭādhyāyī belongs with the Mimāṃsā-sūtra-s to those sūtra texts which show a tendency towards rhythmic formulations [H. Smith, Retractationes rhythmicae (Helsinki, 1951), p. 31 f., and Sukumar Sen, Paninica (Calcutta, 1970), p. 24f.]; it is therefore not necessary to assume that rhythmic sūtra-s like IV 435 f . were borrowed from a metrical grammar.
    ${ }^{26}$ This shows the antiquity of the present tendency (at least in northern India) to pronounce the short $a$ very closed.
The first chapter is basically ${ }^{27}$ taken up by 'meta-rules,' rules about the rules. Some of them are definitions (samijña-sūtra); others, rules of interpretation (paribhāṣā-sūtra). In the definitions, the defined term (samj $\bar{n} \bar{a}$ ) stands last, the content (samjñin) first (cf. Mahābhāsya I 40, 9), e.g. I 160 a-darśanam loqah 'lopa [means] not-being-seen' i.e. the word lopa lit. 'loss, deprivation' denotes no such physical action but merely states that a certain sound or suffix will not be seen. In his meta-rules Pāṇini established a special technical language (meta-language) to facilitate the grammatical description for which he uses the term uqadeśa lit. 'instruction. ${ }^{28}$ The creation of a metalanguage meant in the first place new word-like elements: ${ }^{29}$ the suffix of the part. perf. pass. -ta gets a determinative ${ }^{k}$ to indicate the weak grade of the preceding element (e.g. lup-ta); a suffix - $a$ may get the determinatives $q$ and $q$, the $q$ to indicate in the preceding stem the loss of the last vowel and any consonant that follows, and the $p$ to indicate vṛddhi for the first vowel of the stem ( $a_{a} \bar{v}$ V 162 ; thus we form from trimśjat ' 30 ' traimś-a 'containing 30 chapters' as the name of a text).

New values are assigned to several cases: the genitive is to be construed with a supplied sthāne 'in place of . . ' (saṣthi sthāne-yogā I 1 49), ${ }^{30}$ the locative denotes the following element ('before . . .;' I 1 66), the ablative the preceding one ('after . . .;' I 1 67). Often several such meta-rules are involved in the formulation of a single sūtra. In the manner described above the vowels $i, u, r, l$, short as well as long, can be summed up in the contraction $i^{k}$; likewise all the vowels from $a$ to $a u$ in the contraction $a^{c}$ and the semivowels $y, v, r, l$ in $y a^{n}$. If we add now the proper case endings as per meta-rules we get the sūtra VI $177 i^{k} .0$ $y a^{n} a^{c} . i$ "Instead of $i^{k} y a^{n}$ is substituted before $a^{c}$ "; as both the substitutes $(y, v, r, l)$ and substituends ( $i, u, r, l$ ) are equal in number, the substitution will proceed strictly parallel (cf. Pāṇini's rule I 3 10), corresponding to Whitney's rule number 129: "The i-vowels, the u-vowels, and r, before a dissimilar vowel or a diphthong, are regularly converted each into its own corresponding semi-

    ${ }^{28}$ A grammar of it is H. Scharfe, Pānini's metalanguage (Philadelphia, 1971). Because references in grammar are usually to word forms, references to content are marked with an iti-a direct reversal of the common Sanskrit practice: Kātyāyana's vārttika 3 on I 144 iti-karaṇo 'rtha-nirdeśā̄rthah 'iti is used to make it refer to meaning."
    ${ }^{29}$ The attached determinatives (it) disappear when the Sanskrit word is formed, before the application of any rules. From that follows the explanation of their name: $i-t$ 'the one that goes away' given by Candragomin in his vrtti on I 1 5, Abhayanandin on Jainendravyākarana I 23 , commentary on Sarasvatikaṇthābharaṇa I 26 (cf. the term krt 'primary suffix' from $y^{\prime} k r$, lit. 'that which makes [a noun]'; the Nirukta I 17, II 2, etc. uses nāma-karaṇa 'noun maker'). Less convincing is L. Renou, Altindische Grammatik I (2nd ed.), Introduction, p. 41, with fn. 615: short for iti. In his Terminologie Grammaticale du Sanskrit (2nd ed.), Renou accepted the interpretation 'ce qui s'en va.' Both publications appeared in 1957.

vowel, y or v or r. ${ }^{\prime 31} / 1 /$ though formally included in Pāṇini's rule has no application.

In the root list appended to the grammar, the dhātu-pātha, many roots were marked with one or two technical accents to subject them to certain rules of the grammar(below p. 101); most of these accents can be reconstructed ex resultatu. Besides, the svarita-accent was used to denote adhikāra-s 'charges' (I 3 11). The problem is that we no longer know for sure which of Pāṇini's rules were adhikāra-s and what their functions were. Headlines like III 11 pratyayah "Suffix" were easily recognized as such and hardly needed additional marking. Occasional remarks in the Mahābhāsya have led to another interpretation, viz. that these 'charges' were the expressions that are to be dittoed in the following rules. A difficulty is that the end of the dittoing is not marked as well. There is frequent overlapping and boxing; it is by no means true that a 'charge' would end where the next begins. Another possibility is that a marked 'charge' could refer to a certain section in the grammar, e.g. the word stri- in I 248 if marked as a 'charge' could refer to the striyām-section IV 13-81.32

Under the heading kārake 'for a factor [of the action]' Pāṇini introduces six basic semantic notions (I423-55) that play a crucial role in his syntax and indirectly also in his morphology. Their number and character make it likely that these notions were originally conceived in analogy to the cases (excluding the vocative and the elusive genitive):

I 424 dhruvam apāye 'pādānam "[That which is] firm when departure [takes place] is [called] apädāna 'take-off'"
32 karmaṇā yam abhipraiti sa sampradānam "He whom one aims at with the object is [called] sampradāna 'recipient'" (lit. 'bestowal')
42 sädhakatamam karaṇam "That which effects most is [called] karaṇa 'instrument'"
45 ädhäro 'dhikaraṇam "Substratum is [called] adhikaraṇa 'location'"
49 kartur ipsitatamam karma "What the agent seeks most to attain is [called] karman 'deed, object'"
54 sva-tantrah kartā "He who is independent is [called] kartr 'agent'"33
The objective relations and the kāraka-s do not run completely parallel and therefore the kāraka definitions are followed by amendments which substitute one kāraka for an expected other. By the definition I 445 we expect the substratum of adhi $\sqrt{s t h a}$ 'rule' to be adhikaraṇa; but we are told in I 446 that it is

The sequence in which the definitions are given is the consequence of the rules I 4 1-2 as Kātyāyana vārtt. 30-34 on I 41 demonstrates: each item in this section can have only one technical name, and in case of conflict the one taught later prevails (G.CARDONA, JIPh 1.43f.).
karman instead. Consequently we use (by II 3 2) the accusative grāmam adhitisthati("He rules in the village") and not (by II336) the locative *grāme'dhitiṣthati; and we form a passive grāmo'dhisthīyate instead of *grāme'dhisṭhīyate.

If the notion of kāraka-s was perhaps derived from an observation of Sanskrit cases, Pānini has raised them above the level of case values and made them intermediaries between reality and the grammatical categories. Their importance, often misunderstood, goes far beyond the syntax of cases; next to the roots, they are the prime moving factors of the whole grammar. There are, as Kātyāyana vārtt. 5 on II 31 points out, five ways to express a kāraka relation: case suffix, verbal suffix, krt suffix, taddhita suffix and compound.

The use of cases is taken up only late in the next chapter (II 3 1-73), well separated from the kāraka-section. Though the kāraka values are the basis for the assignment of case suffixes, again there is no one-to-one relationship. ${ }^{34}$ While basically the second case ( $=$ accusative) suffix is used to denote the object (karman), in the Veda also the third case (=instrumental) suffix can be used (II 3 3-4). The number of such modifications in the case syntax section is larger than in the kāraka section which accounts for its greater length. The sequence in which the cases are treated is different from the morphological ranking of the cases as it appears in their names (prathamā 'first' = nominative, dvitīya 'second' = accusative, etc. based on the suffix list IV 1 2); ${ }^{35}$ nor is it related to the sequence of the kāraka definitions. It seems that the sequence is based on the convenience of dittoing expressions from one sūtra onto some following sūtra-s.

The section begins with the sūtra II 31 anabhihite which is dittoed through II 371 (the end of the section): "When it (i.e. the kāraka named in the respective rule) is not already expressed [otherwise]." Evidently, the case syntax rules are conditioned by a prior application of the kāraka definitions. The second case ( $=$ accusative) suffixes are used to denote the object (karman), the third case ( $=$ instrumental) suffixes for the agent (kartr) or instrument (karana), etc., for sundry relations the sixth case ( $=$ genitive) suffixes ${ }^{36}$-all provided that these semantic relations have not already been expressed otherwise. The first case

[^0]:    ${ }^{34}$ Of course, the divergence would be even greater if we tried to pair the cases with the objective relations; cf. also G. Cardona, JOIB 16.207-210.
    ${ }^{35}$ The horizontal arrangement with the nominative first and the accusative second leaves the strong forms of the noun together; if read vertically (as in the punarādheya rite, cf. above p. 80) it allows maximal dittoing of forms.
    ${ }^{36}$ The rule II 350 sastihi sese "The sixth [case ending] for the rest" reflects the difficulty to define in a few words the use of the genitive case; cf. A. Debrunner, Aus der Krankheitsgeschichte des Genitivs (Bern, 1940), E. Schwyzer, Griechische Grammatik, 2nd. ed. (München, 1959), vol. II, p. 89; and also cf. Mahābhāsya I 118, 10 eka-satam sastihy-artāh " 101 are the meanings of the genitive [suffix]" and I 463, 13 karmädīnām avivakṣā śesah "śesa 'rest' is the non-intention to express object, etc." For the residual form of the statement, cf. I 451 akathitam ca "Also that which has not been told so far [is called 'object']." Bhartṛhari's Vākyapadiya III 7, 156 treats śesa like a kāraka, and Amaracandra's Kārakanirūpana lists it as the seventh kāraka [Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Adyar Library, VI (Madras, 1947), p. 151].
( = nominative) suffix is added when we want to express merely the gender and number of the nominal stem notion. ${ }^{37}$

In I 31 bhūv-ādayo dhātavah, Pāṇini defines dhātu 'root' by referring to the root list (dhātu-pātha) appended to his grammar: ${ }^{38}$ "Roots are $\sqrt{b h u} \bar{u}$, etc. (as listed)." He takes up the subject in II $435-57$ when he teaches root substitutions for defective verbs like han/vadh, as/bh $\bar{u}$ that supplement each other in noun formation and verbal paradigm. With the word nucleus thus established, the process of growth-adding suffix after suffix like a tapeworm growing from its head-begins with the sūtra III 11 pratyayah "[What follows now is a] suffix." The first suffixes taught are closest to the roots; in fact Pāṇini declares that they form new roots (III 1 32), for the desiderative and denominative taught here share many properties with the original roots. ${ }^{39}$ The tapeworm develops, so to say, an enlarged head. The addition of further suffixes depends on the direction of growth: verbal or nominal.

In a verbal form the element affixed next to the root is what we call the tempus character, etc.; Kātyāyana and the later Pāṇinīya-s call it vikaraṇa 'modification'-but Pāṇini has no general name for this class of suffixes. ${ }^{40}$ Before the personal endings of the first future an element -sya- is inserted after the root (e.g. $d \bar{a}$-sya-ti; III 133 ), before the endings of the aorist an element ${ }^{c} L^{i}$ which is immediately replaced by the special characters of the different aorist classes ( $a-k \bar{a} r-s-i t$, etc.; III $143-66$ ). Before the personal endings of the present tense, imperfect, imperative, etc. (called collectively sārvadhātuka) the stem forming elements are added to (viz. classes $1,4,5,6,8$ ) and inserted into (viz. class 7) the root: div-ya-ti, tud-a-ti, etc. (III 168-81), but elided in the classes 2 and 3 (II 472-75): ad-O-ti $>$ at-ti, etc. ${ }^{41}$ It is evident in all these instances that the vikaraña-s are dependent on the personal endings (which are endowed with temporal or modal values) because this dependence is expressly laid down in III 167 sārvadhātuke . . "Before a sārvadhātuka suffix . . ."

    ${ }^{38}$ The form bhūv-ādayah is strange. As Patañjali (Mahābhāsya I 253, 2 f.) points out we expect either (in continuous speech) bhy-ādayah or (in discontinuous speech) $b h \bar{u}-a ̄ d a y a h$. But there are indications that for some grammarians $b h \bar{u} v-a ̄ d a y a h$ would be normal sandhi (Abhayanandin on Jainendravyākaraṇa I 2 1; Bhāṣāvrṛtti on Pāṇini VI 1 77: Vyādi, Gālava); then the expression could go back to Pāṇini's predecessors (Yudhristrmin MImā̄saA, Saṃskṛt Vyākaraṇ kā itihās, I, p. 152f.). Of course several forms of $y b h \bar{u}$ show an unexpected /v/ even in Sanskrit, e.g. babhūva.
    ${ }^{39}$ E.g. the formation of the present tense stem including its accentuation or the formation of primary nouns from them.
    ${ }^{40}$ While the tense value is vested in the personal endings only, the Mahābhāsya on III 167 discusses at length whether vikaraña-s or personal endings denote the agent, object, or existence of the action (active or passive meaning in Western terminology); the case for the personal endings appears to be stronger-which leaves the vikaraña-s with no meaning at all.
    ${ }^{41}$ The sequence of the verbal classes is based on the length of the suffix ( $1,6,7$, 8,9 ); into this group the classes with disappearing ( 2,3 ) or alternative ( 4,5 ) suffixes are inserted [B. Shefts, Grammatical method in Pāṇini (New Haven, 1961), p. 2 f.].
After this excursus on the verbal stems the joint presentation of verbal and nominal formations resumes. The three time-classes of reality (past, present and future) result in three sections for suffixes that have such a time connotation: ${ }^{42}$ bhūte 'past' III 2 84, vartamāne 'present' III 2123 and bhavisyati 'future' III 33. In the first section, e.g., the (nominal) zero suffix ${ }^{k} V I^{p}$ is added to the root $\sqrt{c i}$ if it is joined with the noun agni: agni-ci $=\varnothing=t$ 'somebody who has arranged the sacrificial fire' (III 2 91), ${ }^{43}$ in the third section gamin is taught as 'somebody who intends to go' (III 33 ), etc. The verbal suffixes stand side by side with nominal suffixes, but their tempus characterization is more differentiated. While the aorist suffix ( $L u^{4}$ ) is said to denote just past action, the imperfect ( $L a^{y}$ ) is more specifically noted for the past that precedes the present day, and the perfect ( $L i t$ ) for the remote past. Even the present tense suffix ( $L a t$ ) can be used for the past if it is accompanied by the particle sma. The category 'future' logically includes not only the future tenses ( $L r^{t}$ and $L u^{t}$ ) but also the modal forms: after all, the actions referred to in the imperative ( $L o t$ ) and optative ( $L i^{4}$ ) all still lie in the future.

The user has now at his disposal a wide array of suffixes which he can add to the root, both verbal and primary nominal ( $k r t$ ) suffixes. But the order to start the whole process of word and sentence formation, and the decision which of the suffixes to take, comes in the last section, the pivot of Pānini's grammar which returns to the basic concept of the kāraka-s. "[If one wants] to denote the agent, [one can employ] a krt-suffix" (kartari krt III 4 67). But he can also use one of the $L$-forms (verbal personal endings, e.g. paca-ti); this is implied in III 469 [67 kartari] Lah karmaṇi ca bhāve cākarmakebhyah "The verbal ending denotes [the agent] and the object and, after objectless ${ }^{44}$ roots, the existence [of the root meaning itself]. ${ }^{45}$ In traditional Western terminology,

Patañjali (Mahābhāsya II 111, 2-5) considers first käle 'for the past . . . time' but rejects it because käle is not dittoed here. Then he suggests a locative dhätau to be obtained from the ablative dhätoh in III 191 which is dittoed through the chapter. However as the roots themselves are not subject to the time categories he concludes that the actions denoted by the roots are meant. Another, and it seems better, possibility would be an anticipating reference to kartari, karmaṇi and $b h \bar{a} v e$ in III $467+69$. A logical difficulty can easily be met: gamin 'somebody who intends to go' will be an agent of going only in the future even if the person happens to be present; the alternative would be to accept a present agent of a future action which makes no sense at all.

Cardona, Lingua 25.213-220, have drawn attention to the close relation of bhāva and kriy $\bar{a}$; but neither 'état' nor 'action' are satisfactory translations for bhāva. bhāva in V 1119 tasya bhāvas tva-ta ${ }^{1} a u$ "-tva and -tā [denote] the existence of this" cannot be left aside. 'Existence [of the action]' for bhāva has been proposed independently by A. Wezler, Bestimmung und Angabe der Funktion von Sekundär-Suffixen durch Pānini, Wiesbaden 1975, p. 99-104.
this would be the active voice, the personal and the impersonal passive. Of more limited importance are some of the following rules that rule in nominal suffixes to express the kāraka-s sampradāna, apādāna (bhī-ma is 'somebody of whom one is afraid') and adhikaraña (III 4 73-76). While we were made to believe that we could see the verbal 'tapeworm' grow: root, root enlargement, vikaraña and personal endings or krt-suffix, we see now that Pānini held the worm by its tail all along. That leads to the question what his grammar really is: analysis or construction (realization)? Does kartari krt state that 'a krt-suffix denotes the agent'46 or does it direct the user to 'use a krt-suffix to denote the agent'?47 Pānini's procedure indicates that he favoured the second alternative; his substitutions of roots, suffixes and sounds show that he did not start with the finished word or sentence but that these were the final products of the process. At the beginning stands the desire of a speaker to express himself: artha-nimit-taka eva śabdah "The sound utterance of course is brought about by the meaning" as Patañjali later says (Mahābhāṣya I 114, 13 f. and III 253, 12-15). There has never been any doubt that the last three chapters, dealing with internal and external sandhi, ${ }^{48}$ are synthetical. B. Faddegon assumed a dichotomy: the chapters 1 to 5 he labeled 'theory of the ultimate components of language, or the analytical part of grammar,' the chapters 6 to 8 'the theory of phonological and morphological coalescense, or the synthetic part of grammar. ${ }^{49}$ Pānini nowhere makes such a distinction-nor does Patañjali: the whole grammar is synthetic, ${ }^{50}$ but its synthetic character is half hidden in the peculiar presentation which more or less follows the words as they emerge from the mouth of the speaker from root through vikaraña and suffix (nominal krt or verbal $L$ ) to the vibhakti-s. With the vibhakti-s verbs and nouns part their ways. For the $L$-element we substitute one of the 18 substitutes which correspond to the three numbers, three persons and the two genera verbi; in the case of certain tempora or modi, different forms will be substituted. The word components which have so far remained isolated are then joined in the latter part of the grammar through a great number of morphophonemic rules. The nouns too move from the abstract to the concrete: in IV 12 there are seven triplets corresponding to the seven cases (the vocative is regarded as a modified nominative) and three

numbers, ${ }^{51} 21$ suffixes in all that are added to the noun in accordance with the rules II 3 1-73 (käraka-case-relations). Again the coalescence into words is treated later, viz. in the last three books (together with the final development of the verbal forms as many morphophonemic rules apply equally to nominal and verbal forms).

Let us take as an example a simple fact and its expression in the Sanskrit language: Devadatta sings a praise (hymn). Besides the proper name Devadatta, there are the roots $\sqrt{\text { gai }}$ 'sing' and $\sqrt{\text { stu }}$ 'praise.' If the speaker wants to take 'singing' as the basic or connecting notion and if he chooses an agent-directed construction, then the form $g \bar{a} y-a-t i$ denotes not only 'singing' but also the (present!) agent in the singular 'he/she/it sings'; the nominative Devadattah only fills the abstract notion 'agent' with a concrete personality; the object of singing, viz. the praise, appears in the accusative: ${ }^{52}$ Devadattah stotram gāyati "Devadatta sings a hymn." In the goal-directed construction, gi-ya-te denotes (besides 'singing') the (present) object 'he/she/it is being sung'; the nominative stotram only details the specific item. The agent of singing appears in the instrumental: Devadattena stotram giyate "A hymn is being sung by Devadatta." But the speaker may as well decide to express 'praise' by the verb and ends up with a sentence Devadatto gitena stauti "Devadatta praises with a song;" or he may choose a noun construction like Devadattasya stotra-gāyanam . . "Devadatta's praise singing . . ." The word stotram in the sentence Devadattah stotram gāyati contains two kāraka relations: the krt-suffix -tra- denotes the karana 'instrument' of the root notion, i. e. 'instrument of praising' (by rule III 2 182), the accusative ending the karman 'object' of the action of 'singing' expressed by the verb. ${ }^{53}$

Nominal composition, though taught much earlier in the grammar (II 1 1-2 38), really enters only now into the grammatical process. The rule that releases this mechanism is II 11 samarthah padavidhih "[Now] the finite-word rule, with unified object:" when words are so close that they together refer to a single thing or notion, composition replaces case suffixes. ${ }^{54}$ An example is rule II 137 pañcamí bhayana "[A word ending in] an ablative suffix is compounded with bhaya," e.g., vṛkād bhayam 'fear of a wolf' > vṛka-bhayam 'wolf-fear.'

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{51}$ Different from our system, number is not the primary classifier: the three nominatives (sing., dual, plural) come first, then the three accusatives; similarly among verbal endings: the three third persons, the three second persons, etc.
    ${ }^{52}$ stotra 'praise, hymn' is derived from the root y'stu 'praise' with the suffix -tra expressing the kāraka-function 'instrument' (III 2 182): 'instrument of praising'; this complex notion becomes the object of y'gai 'sing' and receives therefore the accusative case ending.
    ${ }^{53}$ In Patañjali's examples (Mahābhāsya I 442, 7f.) prāsāda āste; śayana āste "He sits on the terrace; he sits on the bed" the suffix -ana denotes adhikaraṇa 'location'and so does the locative suffix. Here -ana denotes the location of y'sad 'sit' and $\sqrt{s i}$ 'lie,' respectively; the locative, the location of y'ās 'sit.'
    ${ }^{54}$ Patañjali's discussion of this important sūtra has been translated and explained by S.D. Joshi, Patañjali's Mahābhāsya, Samarthāhnika (Poona, 1968).
Most of the fourth chapter and all of the fifth are devoted to the secondary noun suffixes (taddhita) ${ }^{55}$ which optionally (IV 182 , viz., instead of an otherwise indicated compound) replace longer analytic expressions when the condition of a unified concept is met. ${ }^{56}$ Examples are the patronymics (IV 1 92-178): Dakṣasyāpatyam 'Dakṣa's descendent' $>$ Dakṣa $+i^{5}>$ Dākṣi (IV 1 95), etc. The number of these secondary suffixes is great, and the variety of their meanings shows the sophistication of the language. The kāraka-relations play hardly any role, and even that only indirectly: V 445 [42 anyatarasyām 44 pañcamyās $t a s^{i} h]$ apādāne ca...' -tas may be substituted for the ablative suffix if the suffix denoted apādāna ..." The rules about taddhita-suffixes and composition presuppose a completed 'basic language' with verbal and nominal endings and primary noun formation; for 'unified concepts'57 they offer abbreviated expressions. Dāks $i$ points to one certain person only, while Dakṣasyāpatyam refers to both Dakṣa and the person descended from him.

From the sixth chapter to the end of the grammar Pānini lays down the mechanics that create words and sentences ${ }^{58}$ out of the morphemes taught so far: ${ }^{59}$ where similar vowels meet they merge in their corresponding long variety (e.g. $i+i>i$ ), in other cases we have diphthongs (e.g. $a+i>e$ ), etc.; consonants are also variously affected. A large segment of the sixth chapter (VI 1 158-2 199) deals with the three pitch accents as they result from suffixation and composition.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{55}$ These suffixes form nouns from other nouns. Some of them are first taught with heterophonic elements which are later replaced with the actual morphemes: $Y U$ and $V U$ stand for actual -ana and -aka, respectively (VII 1 1), $P H, D H$, etc. stand for -āyan, -ey, etc. (VII 1 2); cf. H. Scharfe, Pānini's metalanguage, p. 24 f . The term taddhita is probably taken from an older grammar where it prominently defined the function of some suffixes similar to Pān V 1117 tad-arham "[The suffix -vat] is used to denote 'fitting for x.'" Butin Pānini'sgrammar the corresponding rule reads slightly differently V 15 tasmai hitam "good for it" and does not occupy a prominent place. [A. Wezler, Bestimmung und Angabe der Funktion von Sekundär-Suffixen durch Pānini, Wiesbaden 1975, p. 139 proposes instead for taddhita a translation 'daran gefügt' ( $=$ 'joined to x').]
    ${ }^{56}$ samarthānām . . vā of IV 182 refers back to II 11 samarthah padavidhih of the chapter on compounds. On the traditional interpretation of Pān IV I 82 cf. A. Wezler, Bestimmung, passim.
    ${ }^{57}$ To mention just one other group of derivatives, the suffix $T H a p$ (=ika) is joined to prāurṣ 'rainy season' to express the notion 'born in it:' prāurṣika 'born in the rainy season' (IV 325 f .)
    ${ }^{58}$ The crucial word here is samhitāyām (VI 1 72; 3 114; VIII 2 108) which means 'in connected speech,' i.e. in close contact (definition I 4 109). This is not necessarily the same as the sentence but often a sentence phrase (varga): H. Scharfe, ZDMG 117.146f.; K.L. Janert, Abstände und Schlussvokalverzeichnungen in AśokaInschriften (Wiesbaden, 1972), cf. Bhatṭasvāmin's commentary on Arthaśāstra II 10 (JBORS 11.20*), the verse quoted in Pradīpa and Uddyota on I 31 (beginning) and V.L. Joshi, IL 26.66-71. In the text of the Mahābhāsya the sandhi is frequently neglected within a sentence (K.V. Abhyankar, 3rd ed. of the Mahābhāsya, vol. I, p. 561 f.).
    ${ }^{59}$ Dakṣi and prāurṣika just mentioned are in this stage still Dakṣi $+i^{5}$ and prāurṣ + $T^{2} H^{p}$.
For the final section of his grammar Pānini creates a one-directional string of rules, i.e., each rule here applies to forms as they appear up to this point but is 'non-existent' (asiddha) ${ }^{60}$ when it comes to the application of any earlier rule. This is the so-called tripädi 'The Three Sections' (VIII 21-468). ${ }^{61}$ The tripädi deals mainly with special accent rules and with consonant sandhi. The linear nature of these rules prevents them from becoming the cause for the application of an earlier rule: when *rājan looses its final /n/before the suffix -bhis by VIII 27 (>rāja-bhis), this rules does not cause the application of VII 3102 (lengthening of final /a/before suffix) or VII 19 (stems ending in /a/ take the suffix -ais instead of -bhis in the instrumental plural)-because the rule VIII 27 is 'nonexistent' with regard to these preceding rules. The very last rule (VIII 468 a a) corrects an assumption made throughout the grammar (cf. p. 92).

Tradition attaches several appendices to the Aṣtādhyāyī, yet not all of them appear authentic when scrutinized closely. The first and foremost appendix is the root list (dhātu-pātha) which contains all roots of the language arranged in ten classes-dependent on how their verbs form their present tense stem; ${ }^{62}$ roots whose verbs can follow one or the other formation are listed under both classes (e.g. $\sqrt{m r j}$ in classes 2 and 10). Pānini refers in his grammar to these lists with references like div-ädibhyah (in III 169 ) "After the roots $\sqrt{\text { div }}$, etc." In six instances he refers to a certain number of roots from such a class, e.g. VII 398 rudaś ca pañcabhyah "After the five roots $\sqrt{r u d}$, etc." (i.e. $\sqrt{r u d}$ and the four roots that follow it in the root list). Pānini was not satisfied merely to list the roots according to their present tense classes; through various attached determinatives and technical accents he marks them for active or middle inflection of their verbs, insertion of /i/ between the root and certain suffixes, loss of a final nasal, etc. These additional markings are conclusive proof that the $d h a \bar{a} t u$ pätha is authentic, for Pānini teaches these markings in his sūtra-s (e.g. $d u$ in I 35 and III 388 ) while their applications occur only in the root list. Occasionally Pānini wants to grasp in a sūtra several roots that even with all these devices cannot be called upon summarily; in these cases he has no choice but to list the roots in his sūtra one by one (e.g. III 2 182). Though the dhātu-pātha as a whole is proven old, this cannot be said about many single roots: there are many apparent doublets that may have entered into the text at a later date; ${ }^{63}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{60}$ Pānini has invoked the asiddha-principle also in VI 186 and VI 422 , though on a more limited scale.
    ${ }^{61}$ This part of the Astāadhyāyī has been studied in an exemplary fashion by H.E. Buiskool, Pūrvatrāsiddham (Amsterdam, 1934); an abridged English recast of this study is The Tripādī (Leiden, 1939).
    ${ }^{62}$ This arrangement is easily justified by the statistical preponderance of present stem forms.
    ${ }^{63}$ yuch puch much I 229 and jhas $\bar{u} s$ I 720 are graphic variants due to the similarity of the first letters in some script or other. Extensive commentaries on the Dhātupāṭha are the Dhātupradīpa of Maitreyarakṣita from Bengal and the Kṣīratarañgini of Kṣīrasvāmin from Kashmir (both 12th c. A.D.) and the Mādhavīyadhātuvṛtti of Sāyaṇa (14th c. A.D.).
the Pāninīya dhātu-pātha is less well preserved than the root lists of some later grammatical schools. Patañjali has on several occasions proposed adding a root or changing a technical accent ${ }^{64}$ and even where he finally rejected the amendment it has found its way into the traditional text. A major addition to the $d h a \bar{a} t u-p a \bar{t} t h a$ is the root meanings which we now find after each root in the form of a noun in the locative case, e.g. II $1 a d^{a}$ bhaksane ' $\gamma^{\prime} \bar{a} \bar{d}$ in the meaning of eating.' When Patañjali once (Mahābhāsya I 254, 12) recites a segment of the root lists, he recites the roots only: bhv-edh- (cf. the reading of the traditional list bh $\bar{u}$ sattāyām; edha vṛddhau; . . . with the meanings added after each root). Patañjali may however already have known a list of root meanings, because he contrasts in Mahābhāsya I 256, 11-15 certain standard (dṛsta 'noted') root meanings with other occurring meanings. ${ }^{65}$ Tradition attributes the addition of meanings to a certain Bhimasena ${ }^{66}$ who probably only codified traditions current at his time. The modernity of the root meanings is still recognized by Bhaṭtojidīkṣita (17th cent.). ${ }^{67}$

A second appendix consists of the over 200 word-lists (gana), often collectively called gana-pātha. These lists do not form a corpus but occur in the commentary on the sūtra-s, e.g. in the Kāśikā-vṛtti, wherever a sūtra with an expression like svar-ädini ('svar, etc.') called for such elaboration. It is generally conceded that the lists were expanded over the centuries, not only through copying mistakes but also through deliberate additions; the occurrence of a word in the gana-pātha is therefore no proof that the word or its object were known to Pānini. ${ }^{68}$ The insertion of new words into the list was facilitated by the doctrine (first indicated by Patañjali, Mahābhāsya I 400, 13) that besides 'complete' lists (samppūrna-gana) there are lists that comprise all words of the same type (äkrti-gana) even if these are not expressly mentioned in it. As the need to insert new words continued, more and more gana-s were gradually claimed to be such äkṛti-gana-s: gaṇa 219 vrihy-ādayah on Pānini V 2116 was not regarded as an äkṛti-gana in the Kāśikā, but later was so regarded in Vāmana's Kāvyālaṃkāra-sūtra V 2 57. The distinction is not based on any indication of Pānini's who uses in his sūtra-s references like amśv-ādayah, urah-prabhṛtayah, gaväśva-prabhṛtini, goträdini and ardharcāh with no apparent difference in meaning. In a few instances (ayasmayädini I 420 , indrajananädayah IV 3 88, tujādayah VI 1 7) the vṛtti has no list at all. Besides such words the gaṇa-s contain a number of sūtra-like sentences which the later Pāniniya-s

call gaṇa-sūtra-s; many of them are identical with sūtra-s of Pānini or vārttika-s of Kātyāyana while the origin of others is unclear. ${ }^{69}$

What is the evidence for Pānini's authorship of the gaṇa-s? The question must be asked because a sūtra like I 127 sarvādini sarvanāmāni "Pronouns are sarva, etc." does not necessarily indicate the existence of a list 'sarva, etc.' It is likely that Pānini explained the rule to his students and named other words that fell under his term sarvanāman, but he need not have given them a fixed list, on a par with the sūtra-s themselves or with the dhātu-pātha. Six times he refers to the dhātu-pātha with a numbered reference (e.g. VII 275 kiraś ca pañcabhyah "And after the five roots $\sqrt{k_{r}^{2}}$, etc."), ${ }^{70}$ twice to the sūtra-s (VI 2135 ṣat ca kāndādini "And the six words kānda, etc." refers to words mentioned in the rules VI 2 126-129; VII 116 pūrvādibhyo navabhyo vā "Optionally after the nine words pūrva, etc." refers to the nine words mentioned in I 1 34-36). But only once Pānini seems to refer to the gaṇa-s in this way: VII 125 ad dataradibhyah pañcabhyah "The ending -at is substituted after the five words ending in -atara, ${ }^{71}$ etc." which includes words ending in -atama ${ }^{72}$ as well as itara, anya and anyatara-altogether 9 words. Is this a reference to a section of the gaṇa sarvädini (241, 5-9) or did Pānini merely want to indicate that five analogous formations or words form the neuter nom./acc. sing. in -at and left it to the student to identify these five? Twice, it was mentioned, Pānini refers with numbered references to words taught in the sūtra-s: VI 2135 ṣat ca kāndādini and VII 116 pūrvādibhyo navabhyo vā; if there were fixed gaṇa-s there is a danger that the first would be taken to refer to kānda in the gaṇa bilvādayah (thus denoting the six words kānda, mudga, masūra, godhūma, iksu and vemu), the second to pūrya in the gaṇa ardharcāh (and thus denoting the nine words pürva, camasa, kșira, karṣa, ākāśa, aṣtāpada, mangala, nidhana and niryāsa). The difficulty disappears if there were no fixed gaṇa-s in Pānini's time.

If the fixed gaṇa-s should go back to Pānini himself, it remains unclear why we have so many sūtra-s with long lists of words (e.g. II 165 ; III 121 ) instead of a short reference to an attached gaṇa; Vedic nipātana rules (which teach the desired forms directly) almost never use the gaṇa-technique to reduce their bulkiness (e.g. III 1 123). ${ }^{73}$ When a quotation of roots cannot be given with a

[^0]:    ${ }^{69}$ An extreme position was taken by R. Brrwe, Der Gaṇapāṭha zu den Adhyāyās IV und V der Grammatik Pāninis (Wiesbaden, 1961), who on p. 18, fn. 1, attributes most gaṇa-sūtra-s to Pānini and on p. 26 f . some to his predecessors because of their 'pre-Pāṇinian terminology:' ākhyāta 'verb' in gaṇa mayūra-vyaṃsakādayah, sa 'compound' (short for samāsa) in gaṇa utsādayah and samāhy-akṣara 'diphthong' in gaṇa svar-ädini. This argument however is inconclusive because ākhyāta and samāhyakṣara were used by Kātyāyana and other Pāniniya-s, sa in the late Jainendravyākaraṇa.

reference to the dhātu-pātha ${ }^{74}$ because the roots are not consecutive in it, Pānini lists the roots in the sūtra (e.g. I 27 mṛda-mṛda-gudha-kusa-kliśa-vadavas.ah ${ }^{\text {s }}$ tva ) without recourse to a gana. In Pānini's treatment of the particles (nipāta) the only element of vagueness is in the sūtra I 457 [56 nipātāh] cádayo 'sattve "ca, etc. [are nipāta-s] except when they denote substances": the definition of 'ca, etc.' depends on the gana attached to it. It is worth noting that the Bṛhaddevatā II 93 states that iyanta iti samikhyānaṃ nipātānāṃ na vidyate "There does not exist an enumeration of the particles stating explicitly: 'there are so many'"; almost identical is the statement of Rgveda-prātísākhya XII 9 (26) néyanta ity asti samikhyā. Shall we assume that the gana-s were non-existent when these two texts were composed? This would force us to assume for them a higher date than for Kātyāyana who was quite familiar with the gana-s. Or did the author(s) of the two texts ignore this part of Pānini's work deliberately? The likely answer is that the gana cádayah was regarded by them as an $\bar{a} k r t i-$ gana. ${ }^{75}$

The gana-s lack a feature typical for sūtra- and dhātu-pātha: Pānini's knack of putting every formulation to double or triple use through a resourceful employment of sequence, accents and determinatives. The gana-s may in character if not in the exact formulation represent the explanations given to students. If that is so, then even the insertion of sūtra-s into a gana (e.g. I 1 $34-36$ in the gana sarvädini) is justified: as a mere duplication it cannot claim to teach anything new but it assists in the interpretation of the sūtra I 127 sarvādini sarvanāmāni. It is remarkable that Jinendrabuddhi (11th cent.) in his Nyāsa on the Kāśikā on IV 1 106, V 32 and VII 43 claims that the gaṇa-s are not Pāṇinian and that the author of the gana-s is not the author of the sūtra-s (anyo hi gana-kārah, anyaś ca sūtra-kārah).

A third alleged appendix is the $u^{9}$-ädi-sūtra-s ${ }^{76}$ in which nouns are derived from roots in a more irregular fashion. Pānini twice (III 31 and 475 ) refers to the suffixes $u^{9}$, etc., but it is not clear whether he referred to a specific list and if he did, to which or whose. The $u^{9}$-ädi-list which is now attached to his grammar (e.g. in the appendix to the Siddhānta-kaumudī) is sometimes ascribed to Śākaṭāyana. ${ }^{77}$ Because Śākaṭāyana, Pānini's forerunner, held the view that every noun can be derived from a root he must almost of necessity have had a similar list of irregular suffixes; the Pāniniya-s, on the other hand, believe that

the words with $u^{9}$-ädi suffixes are really not built up ( $u^{9}$-ādayo 'vyutpannāni prātipadikāni, paribhāsā 22 in Nāgojībhațta's Paribhāşenduśekhara). The question arises why Pānini referred to $u^{9}$-ädi suffixes at all if he disapproved of the procedure. It is perplexing, to say the least, that Pānini often refers to suffixes which he has never introduced. Some of these are mentioned without determinatives, e.g. as-anta '[stems] ending in -as' (VI 4 14), -tu- (VII 2 9) or is-us.oh 'of [words ending in] -is or -us' (VIII 3 44); one could possibly argue that /as/, /is/, /us/ and /tu/ were not conceived as suffixes. This is however not possible for VI 497 is-man-tra-n.VI.su ca "Also before [the suffixes] -is, -man, -tra and ZERO" where the suffixes -is (chadis), -man (chadman), -tra (chattra) and ZERO (upacchad) are mentioned side by side: tran ${ }^{n}$ has a determinative ${ }^{n}$; it cannot be a reduced form of previously taught $t \underline{t a n}$ (III 2 181-186) because the sphere of $t \underline{t a n}$ is restricted to certain roots excluding $\sqrt{c h a d}$. As Pānini has never taught the use of these suffixes one must conclude that they were $u^{9}$-ädi suffixes; $\operatorname{tran}$ and $u^{9}$ are quoted with their determinatives, others (e.g. $-i s$, $-u s$ and -tu) without them. That corresponds to Pānini's frequent practice to refer to his own suffixes in a short form. While a suffix is ${ }^{4}$ is found in our (spurious) Un-ādi-sūtra-s to account for chadis (265), chattra is not accounted for. If Pānini knew some $u^{9}$-ädi lists, there is no indication that he knew the Un-ädi-sūtra-s we have. In fact Un-ādi-sūtra 73 cāyah kih gives every impression of being modelled after Pānini VI 121 cāyah $k \bar{\imath},{ }^{78}$ Un-ādi-sūtra 215 aVI ${ }^{b}$ vaci-pracchi-sri-sru-dru-pru-ju.ām dirgho 'samprasāraṇam ca after Kātyāyana's vārttika 2 on III 2178 vaci-pracchy-āyatastu-kaṭapru-ju-srīnām dirghaśs ca. Patañjali's suggestion (Mahābhāsya II 135, 14) bhiyah krukan api vaktavyah "The suffix -ruka- after $\sqrt{b h i}$ also must be taught (to account for bhīruka 'fearful')" was apparently the source for Un-ādi-sūtra 189 bhiyah krukan. ${ }^{79}$ I conclude that Pānini knew some $u^{9}$-ädi list but that the ones we have are later than Patañjali.

The Lingānuśāsana 'Instruction about gender'80 sometimes attributed to Pānini (e.g. Appendix to the Siddhānta-kaumudī) is probably much later than Patañjali. It is not mentioned in the Mahābhāsya and Patañjali's thesis lingam aśisyam lokâśrayatvāl lingasya "The gender need not be taught because it is based on usage" (Mahābhāsya I 390, 18f. and often) speaks against the existence of an authoritative work on gender in his time. The composition of gender manuals was probably inspired by the lexica which often have a special section on gender.

The Phit-sūtra-s ${ }^{81}$ of Śāntanava are also probably later than Patañjali. They teach in a mechanical way the Vedic accents of noun stems.

Pānini seven times refers to the 'language' (bhāṣā; e.g. III 2 108), in contrast to the language of the older Vedic literature (chandas). ${ }^{82}$ Several of his rules refer clearly to spoken language: in VIII 283 f . we are told that the last vowel in a sentence has the high pitch accent and is extra long when one responds to a greeting-except when the other man is a suidra (low caste man); the same applies if one shouts from a distance. But Pānini is concerned only with the spoken idiom of the educated classes; the language of the lower classes was, in his time, probably much closer to the Prakrit dialects as the occurrence of popular forms in texts as old as the Rgveda (e.g. akhkhalikrtya) and the prominence of Middle Indo-Aryan dialects at the times of Buddha and Aśoka Priyadarśin indicate.

Pānini's verbal paradigm had lost many of the competing options we find in the older Vedic texts and verb and prefix are now joined together; in noun inflection, the ancient distinction of devī and vrki types is a thing of the past. On the other hand, the distinctions of the past tenses (perfect for the distant past, aorist for the most recent past, imperfect for the past before the present day) are still retained, the verbal duals in -äte and -äthe are not yet pragrbya and the subjunctive is still taught. The periphrastic perfect (unknown to the oldest Vedic texts) is formed only with $\sqrt{k r}$ : corayām cakāra in accordance with later Vedic usage. Pānini's language is virtually the language of the brāhmaṇa-s and sūtra-s of the later Vedic period. ${ }^{83}$

Considering that Pānini hailed from Śalātura in the northwest Punjab it is not surprising that his language is especially close to that of the Kāṭhakasamhitā which represents the northern Yajurveda tradition as opposed to those traditions of the East (Vājasaneyi-samhitā), South (Taittirīya-samhitā) and the West (Maitrāyaṇī-samhitā): ${ }^{84}$ amāvasyà besides amāvāsyà (III 1 122), apāṃnaptrīya (IV 2 28) and katipayatha (V 2 51). ${ }^{85}$ The syntax of cases fits closely with the Vedic prose of the brāhmaṇa-s and sūtra-s. ${ }^{86}$ The language of the North was regarded the best in Kauśitaki Brāhmaṇa VII 6 tasmād udīcyām diśi prajñāatatarā vāg ucyata udañca u eva yanti vācam sikṣitum yo vā tata āgacchati tasya vā śuśrūsante "In the northern region, speech is spoken particularly distinct.

its position of authority at a time when the language of the North was yet felt to be exemplary. Later the highest authority on language and customs rests with the people of Āryāvarta (central North India): Mahābhāṣya III 174, $7-10 .{ }^{87}$

Pānini's credibility was severely challenged by W.D. Whitney ${ }^{88}$ who pointed out the great number of unattested roots in the Dhātu-pātha (he found only little more than one third of its roots attested in other than grammatical texts) and other peculiar forms taught in the Aṣtādhyāyī but not found in literature. We must consider however that we have only fragments of the Vedic literature and that Pānini, along with such texts, relied on the spoken language that was familiar to him. It is only natural that he knew and taught words and forms that have not come down to us. This became apparent when subsequently some such forms came to light in L. von Schroeder's editions of the Kāṭhaka and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. Concerning the unattested roots, one must further keep in mind that the tradition of the Dhātupātha is much less reliable than that of the Sūtrapātha; it is easier to insert items into a list and moreover the Mahābhāṣya affords us hardly any checks on the tradition of the root lists. The existence, side by side, of the roots kakh (I 124 and 821) with the variants kakkh and khakh (I 124) and ghaggh (I 170) with the variants gaggh and ghagh all meaning 'laugh' points to onomatopoetic formations in colloquial usage; similarly carc, jarc, jarts, jharjh 'rebuke, chide' which remind of tarj and bharts may be local variants. Other roots have only nominal and no verbal derivatives, which still makes them eligible for the root lists; the notion of 'verbal' roots is not Pāṇinian. It may be true that these roots have been set up to account for the formation of a few nouns: they are 'artificial,' fictitious, e.g. $\sqrt{\text { ghr }}$ (I 985) accounting for ghrta, ghrna and gharma. ${ }^{89}$ But so are all of Pānini's roots; they are abstracts, attempts to pronounce mental images, and he never entertained the notion that these at some time past formed separate words with suffixes following. Pānini thought strictly synchronically, not historically.

Harsh criticism was also directed at the Vedic rules in Pānini's grammar. It was felt that here we have, in contrast to the spoken language, the control material to test his competence. On the one hand Pānini notices the finest distinctions: he has observed that the abhinihita-samdhi, i.e. the elision of an initial /a/ after word final /e/ or /o/ is not observed inside a verse line unless /a/ is followed by /v/ or /y/ (VI 1 115)—and the next rules give seven exceptions to

On what basis these roots were assigned to verb classes and why they received determinatives is not clear. But this problem is not confined to roots like $\sqrt{ } g h r ; d r s$ s that has no present tense stem is listed with the first class (I 1037) as are also some other defective roots without present tense stems that are taught as root substitutes (vadh for han, ah for br $\bar{u}$ ). In some cases root substitutes in present tense stems (yach for $d \bar{a}$, paśy for $d r \bar{s}$, dhau for $s r$, etc.) are not listed in the Dhātupāṭha.
the exception. All these statements check out perfectly with the Vedic texts. On the other hand, the presentation of the Vedic peculiarities is very spotty. Major features are not treated at all and the selection of archaisms seems to be without principle. ${ }^{90}$ It is clear from this that the Vedic rules have only the character of a supplement; moreover, it was not necessary to repeat the treatment of features that the Vedic dialects had in common with the later language. A method of description somewhat strange to the spirit of Pānini's grammar is more frequently employed for Vedic forms, viz. mentioning of the finished form without any grammatical build-up (so-called nipātana-sūtra-s; nipātana lit. 'letting it drop in'); ${ }^{91}$ sometimes a whole Vedic passage is quoted (e.g. VII $143 ; 269$ ).

Several times Pānini refers to the Eastern or Northern usage; ${ }^{92}$ the genitives prācām and udīcām need not refer to Eastern or Northern grammarians as the Kāśikā on IV 117 suggests (prācām ācāryānạam matena). Being himself from the North, Pānini gives more intimate details concerning Northern usage: IV 274 informs us that the names of some wells north of the river Vipāś(modern Bias) vary in their accent from those south of the river (a well dug by a man named Datta would be called dâtta north but dättá south of that river). Other Northern expressions were probably rare archaisms like mātara-pitarau 'mother and father' (VI 332 ) against common mätā-pitarau or pitarau (I 2 70). The 'Eastern' rules refer to Eastern cities, their inhabitants and to features of their speech. Of these the word ekatama 'one of many' (V 394 ) is actually first attested in an Eastern text, the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa I 6, 3, 23.

Pānini's object was the colloquial as well as literary language of the educated without any reference to certain Vedic branches of tradition. Once his work was classified as a 'limb of Veda' (vedānga) it became necessary to say this, because ordinarily Vedic traditions were the property of certain schools alone. Patañjali defends the formulation of optional rules by saying: sarva-vedapārisadam hidam sāstram; tatra naikah panthāh sakya āsthātum "This instructional work belongs to all Vedic schools; therefore it is not possible to resort to one single way" (Mahābhāsya I 400, 10f.; III 146, 15f.). Pānini's rules were accepted, we do not know since what time, as authority on Sanskrit grammar wherever Sanskrit was used; later remakes were concerned almost exclusively with easier or more logical presentation and only rarely with new observations of usage. That does not mean that everything Pānini taught was put into practice. The rule VIII 456 vâvasāne states that in final position with no other word following immediately (i.e. at the end of a sentence or sentence segment)

voiced stops are only optionally devoiced: suhrd besides suhrt. ${ }^{93}$ Later grammarians paid lip service to this rule (e.g. the Kāśikā on this rule; Candragomin VI 4 149; Jainendra V 4 131) but the voiced stop is never found in this position in any texts as far as our manuscripts go. ${ }^{94}$

Pānini and with him the grammarians that contributed to the science of grammar before him, owe their greatness to a combination of fundamental discoveries: 1) the insight that the proper object of grammar is the spoken language, not its written presentation; 2) the theory of substitution; 3) the analysis in root and suffix; 4) the recognition of ablaut correspondences; 5) the formal description of language as against a 'logical' characterization; and 6) the concise formulation through the use of a metalanguage. It is often said that the transparent nature of Sanskrit made the analysis possible. But we can argue as well that it was first Pānini's (and his predecessors') analysis which made the structure so transparent: was the relationship of dohmi and adhukṣat, or majjati and madgu really that obvious?

While the Prātisākhya-s and our own popular grammar have it that e.g. the sound $/ \mathrm{b} /$ becomes $/ \mathrm{p} /$ under certain conditions, it has always been the view of Indian grammarians that the sound $/ \mathrm{p} /$ is substituted for $/ \mathrm{b} / ; / \mathrm{b} /$ does not change, it is our mind that switches from one phoneme to the other. Before certain suffixes, the root $b h \bar{u}$ is substituted for the root as (II 452 ); here it would be difficult anyway to speak of 'change.' Substitutions apply to single sounds, sound groups, suffixes and roots. Substitutions make it possible to derive the parallel inflections of different noun classes and the pronouns from a single set of case suffixes; ${ }^{95}$ but no attempt is made to further reduce the case suffixes of singular, dual and plural to a single set with separate number markers because no Sanskrit paradigm shows such a reduction. It is necessary that the substitutions are valid throughout unless limited by special conditions. Strict application of the theory led to remarkable results of internal reconstruction. The sentence variants aśvas, aśvah, aśvaś, aśvo, aśva, etc. can be explained from a basic form aśvas; this happens to be historically the oldest form (I. E. *ek̄uos). Even more striking is the assumption of a root masj as the common basis of the verb majjati 'submerges' and the noun madgu 'diver-bird' which can be derived from it by independently established substitution rules. The comparison with Latin mergo 'submerge' and mergus 'diver-bird' leads us to a reconstructed Indo-European root mes $\bar{g}$ 'dive:' Pānini's internal reconstruction could not have been closer.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{93}$ Rgveda-prātisākhya I 3(15/16) tells us that Gārgya favoured the voiced, Śākaṭāyana the unvoiced stop; Caturādhyāyikā I 8 recognizes only the unvoiced as correct.

    94 W.D.Whitney, Sanskritgrammar, §141b; J.Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik I, p. 302 f. §260a.
    ${ }^{95}$ The case suffixes taught in IV 12 are essentially those that appear with the noun stems ending in consonants; but the nom. sing. suffix $s^{u}$ is only reached by internal reconstruction as it never appears with the above-mentioned stems. The internal reconstruction is confirmed by comparative and historical reconstruction: Sanskrit $v \bar{a} k$, Latin vōx (i.e. vōk-s).
At a later time the substitution theory came into conflict with the Mīmāmsā dogma of the permanence of words/speech sounds (sabda-nityatva): how can the sabda-s be permanent if their constituent elements are subject to substitutions? Kātyāyana who raised the question in his vārttika 12 on I 156 answered in vārttika 14 that it is only our notion of sounds that undergoes substitution. In deference to the Mīmāmsā finally a compromise was reached that left both concepts outwardly intact but warped: all of Pānini's substitutions are substitutions of complete words; in a series of substitutions aśva $+s u>a s ́ v e+s u>$ aśvesu we have not just a substitution of $a>e$ and $s>s$ (nor do /a/ and /s/ 'change' to /e/ and /s/) but first aśvesu is substituted for aśvasu and then aśvesu for aśvesu. ${ }^{96}$

The analysis in root and suffix went beyond a mere separation of 'word' and 'ending' or a mechanical division of root and the remainder of the word. To a meaning-carrying nucleus called 'root' a well ordered string of suffixes is added. Some of these suffixes called krt can only be attached to roots directly, others called taddhita can be added only to such previously established composites, sometimes a few in a row. The suffixes indicate a functional relation of the nuclear meaning: 'location of $x$,' 'agent of $x$,' 'existence of $x$,' etc. The case endings of nouns and the personal endings of the verb finally relate these words to other words in the sentence. This should not, however, be understood as an historical statement in the spirit of the 19th century linguistics when it was for some time believed that people originally used in their speech naked roots to which rootlike elements were attached until the latter became gradually mere suffixes to the root. Pānini's rules are purely descriptive and synchronic; the furthest concession ever made by Sanskrit grammarians to an historical approach is the recognition of nirūdha-lakṣan $\bar{a}$ 'stabilization of an originally secondary meaning. ${ }^{97}$ Pānini's suffixes are as much abstractions as his roots. When he derives from utsa- 'well' an adjective autsa- 'being in or produced by a well' by adding to utsa- a suffix $a^{a}$, the only visible effect is the vrddhi in the first syllable: $u \bar{t} s a+a^{a}>a u \bar{t} s a$ - (IV 1 86), besides the capacity to be inflected in any of the three genders as demanded by its noun of reference. From the (abstract) root diś 'point' Pānini derives the (inflectable) noun diś- fem. 'direction' by adding a suffix ${ }^{k} \mathrm{VI}^{n}$ which disappears after creating the accented noun: diś $+{ }^{k} \mathrm{VI}^{n}>$ diś (III 2 59). These 'zero suffixes'-rediscovered for modern linguistics by F. de Saussure-may have created the frame of mind that led to another great achievement in India: the position value of ciphers including zero. ${ }^{98}$

From correspondences like patati paṣāta; vidyā veda vaidika; buddha bodha bauddha; kyti kartr kārya a scheme of vowel alternation (ablaut) was abstracted in which the first and shortest vowel constituted the unnamed base form, the

second the 'quality' (guna ${ }^{99}$ ) form, the third the 'growth' ( $v r d d h i$ ) form. Again this is not an historical statement on the relative age of the ablaut vowels. Before certain suffixes the base vowel of the root (or of another, preceding suffix) is replaced by the guña or vrddhi vowel. ${ }^{100}$ The roots are usually ${ }^{101}$ given in the base form because this constitutes the smallest unit that still contains the full meaning. The beauty of the three-level scheme is marred by two irregularities. Pānini had not recognized that parallel to $i$ e ai and $u o a u$ the base form corresponding to guña $/ \mathrm{a} /{ }^{102}$ and vṛddhi /ā/ is 'zero'. Pānini explains the reduplicated aorist $a-p a-p t-a m$ (from the root pat 'fall'), therefore, as an $a$-aorist with an ad hoc invented infix $/ \mathrm{p} /: a-p a[p] t-a m$ (VII 4 19). The roots following this ablaut type are taught with the guña vowel: pat, pac, etc. One could argue that these roots would be hard to pronounce with a zero vowel; if they could be, we would still need to know where to put the guña or vṛddhi vowel. It is possible that Pānini for these reasons chose to teach these roots as he did; but with his usual ingenuity he could certainly have found a solution to this problem and it remains probable that he had not recognized the full ablaut scheme. Whether Pānini failed to recognize a second type of ablaut ( $r$ ra $r \bar{a} ; i$ ya $y \bar{a} ; u$ va vā) is hard to say. He teaches roots with such ablaut in the guña grade: prach, ${ }^{103}$ vac, yaj, etc. and institutes a special procedure to achieve the shortest vowel grade, the 'stretching' (saṃprasārana) of the semivowel into the corresponding vowel and consequent loss of $/ \mathrm{a} /:$ prch, $u c, i j$. Had Pānini given these roots in their shortest form, this would have called for a special marker or a list in order to prevent the usual guña and vṛddhi substitutions $\left({ }^{* *}\right.$ parch, ${ }^{* *} o c,{ }^{* *} e j,{ }^{* *}$ pāch, etc.). This would not seem overly complicated and it appears likely, therefore, that Pānini had not recognized this type of ablaut as an independent variety.

Whenever grammar is developed as an ancilla philosophiae there is a danger that logical or metaphysical categories are forced on the grammatical analysis: subject, predicate, substantive, etc. In India grammatical analysis preceded, due to the role of Vedic tradition and the techniques of text preservation, the systematic philosophies. Pānini gives us neither a logical nor a psychological but a grammatical description of his language. Words that end in one of the case suffixes $s^{u} \ldots s u^{p}$ are our 'nouns,' those that end in personal endings from

    100 These vowels may be further affected by internal sandhi: cikai-a >cikāya.
    101 Exceptions are roots of which no forms with the base vowel commonly occurred in the language.
    ${ }^{102}$ For reasons given below, guña /a/ is never ruled in and rarely alluded to (cf. VI 197). The main use of $a$ in I 12 is for the guña of $/ \gamma /$, i.e. $/ a r /$ (with the assistance of I 151 ); cf. below, p. 163, fn. 7.
    ${ }^{103}$ This is one instance where internal and comparative/historical reconstruction differ: Pānini separates gacchati (gam $>$ gach; VII 377 ) from prcchati. The I. E. type $g^{u} \eta-s \bar{k} \bar{o} p r \bar{k}-s \bar{k} \bar{o}$ was no longer transparent in Pānini's time due to phonological developments. prach offered a base for the derivation of both prcchati (VI $116+73$ ) and praśna (III 390 ; VI 4 19).
$t i p$ to mahi ${ }^{\bar{n}}$ our 'verbs. ${ }^{104}$ The verb is used in the second person if the word 'you' stands with it in congruence or at least could stand with it; in the first person if 'I/we' could go with it; and in the third person in the remaining cases (I 4 105-108). The verb [-ending] denotes in itself the agent (in the active and middle voice) or the object or existence [of the action] (in the so-called passive). The action expressed by the verb has a large potential to supplement itself with expressions for 'factors' (käraka) of the action such as instrument, location, agent, object, etc. which can be expressed by noun cases or by other suffixes. The concept of käraka-s helps to separate and link at the same time logical and grammatical notions.

The algebraic formulation ${ }^{105}$ of Pānini's rules was not appreciated by the first Western students; they regarded the work as abstruse or artificial. This criticism was evidently not shared by most Indian grammarians because several of them tried to outdo him in conciseness by 'trimming the last fat' from the great teacher's formulations: notably Devanandin, the author of the Jainendra grammar, and Vopadeva, the author of the Mugdhabodha. The Western critique was muted and eventually turned into praise when modern schools of linguistics developed sophisticated notation systems of their own. Grammars that derive words and sentences from basic elements by a string of rules ${ }^{106}$ are obviously in greater need of a symbolic code than paradigmatic or directmethod practical grammars.

It is interesting to observe in contrast what Pānini does not teach. First he does not deal with phonetics. When he appears to do so, the thrust of his rule is nevertheless grammatical: terming sounds with an equal pronunciation effort in the mouth ${ }^{107}$ sa-varna 'of equal colour' (I 19 ) is necessary for the use of this term in several later rules (e.g. I 169 ; VI 1 101). The term anunāsika 'nasal sound' and the three pitch accents were possibly defined because they form part of the metalanguage. ${ }^{108}$ The reason for this exclusion of phonetics is that they are presupposed, because "grammar is the science studied later on" (vyākaraṇaṃ nāmêyam uttarā vidyā, Mahābhāṣya I 208, 19).

[^0]
[^0]:    104 The terms nāman 'noun' and $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ 'verb' were known to Pānini because he teaches in IV 372 the formation of nāmika and ākhyātika (or nāmākhyātika?) which obviously refers to works or a work dealing with nouns and verbs.
    105 Often mislabeled in the past as 'mnemotechnical devices.'
    106 This string can be very long. The fixation of the root vowel (i.e. $r>a r$ ) alone in the aorist form ajāgarisam 'I woke up' involves the application of nine sūtra-s (VI 177 ; VII 21 through 5 and 7 ; VII $384-85$ ) in an amazing zigzag of rules and restrictions. Important is the reduction to a few basic and recurrent processes. Processes that apply in different stages of the word formation are stated only once, e.g. the replacement of simple vowels by the corresponding semi-vowels in internal and external sandhi (VI 177 ).

While Pānini teaches the formation of many nouns he is not interested in their lexical aspect, nor does he teach grammatical gender. The root list likewise is free of lexical meanings. Due to the relatively free word order in Sanskrit there are but few references to such ordering. ${ }^{109}$

It is a puzzling question ${ }^{110}$ why Pānini has failed to derive some common Sanskrit nouns with lucid root and ablaut relations: manas from $\sqrt{\text { man, śravas }}$ from $\sqrt{s r u$, cetas from $\sqrt{c i t}$. Similarly havis from $\sqrt{h u}$ and yajus from $\sqrt{y a j}$, chattra from $\sqrt{c h a d}$ and saktu from $\sqrt{s a \tilde{n} j}$ are not taught in his grammar although the suffixes are occasionally alluded to-they must be $u^{9}-a ̄ d i$ suffixes (cf. our Unādisūtra no. 628-678). L. Renou ${ }^{111}$ has suggested that maybe these formations were not taught because they had ceased to be productive. But Pānini has not hesitated otherwise to derive archaic nouns (in his Vedic rules) and he has even taught a suffix for the benefit of a single noun: he derives gāthaka 'singer' from $\sqrt{g a i}$ with the unique suffix thak $a^{n}$ (III 1 146). ${ }^{112}$

Though it is sometimes said that Pānini's grammar lacks instruction in syntax, we have seen above that this is not quite correct. Syntax is amalgamated with the formation of words in the process from thought to its verbal expression. I find it surprising though that on the one hand the dominant role of the verb (and some verbal nouns called kytya, etc., III 470 f .) is fully appreciated, and yet on the other hand, no attention is given to other frequent nominal (i.e. verbless) sentences of Sanskrit. Kātyāyana felt the shortcoming and sought to remedy it. One could amend the rule for the nominative case ending so that it covers also instances of identification: virah purusah 'the man [is] a hero'; the amendment is however found unnecessary because the identification is obtained from the sentence as a whole. Or one could assume that the word 'is/are' must be understood in all 'verbless' sentences. ${ }^{113}$ The lack of any reference to this type of nominal sentences is not quite consistent with the usual process of sentence and word formation in which, as a rule, the options are spread out for selection.

Pānini's description is so complex that the author must have reworked it repeatedly, and one can only wonder if this formidable task could have been carried out without written notes. Writing was certainly known to Pānini as he himself refers once to script (lipi/libi 'script' III 2 21). Whether Pānini used written notes or not, after the task was completed the work was handed down by oral tradition like other texts of that time. The result is a work that is not easy to

understand, every syllable frought with meaning, often a double or triple meaning; even the sequence of the rules is often important. At the same time, one cannot understand a rule properly if one lacks instant recall of every rule in the Aṣtādhyāyī as only careful memorizing can give it. Through Pānini's associative digressions many items are treated in unlikely sections and whoever attempts to follow through the formation of a word has to jump forward and backward in the grammar from one rule to another. This has earned the Aṣtādhyāyī the nickname of the 'untimely grammar' (a-kälakaṃ vyākaraṇam, Candravṛtti on II 2 68). ${ }^{114}$ The first explanation of this expression is found in the Nyāsa on Kāśikā II 4 21, viz., that Pānini's grammar has no section on grammatical time, and a few centuries later the Padamarijarī, on the same passage, elaborates that in contrast to previous grammars Pānini's Aṣtādhyāyī is devoid of metarules on 'today's,' etc. In the 14th c. A.D. Sāyana tells us in his Dhātuvṛtti (under j $\bar{a} \bar{a}$ avabodhane) that Pānini was the first to break with the tradition. One can see how the growing distance in time lent wings to the commentators' fancy; had they known any such older grammars they would not have failed to mention them. It must be noted that the expression is first found in a Buddhist text, the Candravṛtti, from which the Kāśikā frequently borrows, ${ }^{115}$ and that $a$-kälaka is a Buddhist vinaya term found in the Sanskrit Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra 40.54, Divyāvadāna 130.22 and Mahāvastu I 306, 13 meaning 'provided at odd times.' It voices a critique on Pānini (the use of the Buddhist term must have had an ironical effect) from a scholar who tried to improve on Pānini's grammar - even if Candragomin should not be the author of the bonmot. The arrangement of rules in the Aṣtādhyāyī ${ }^{116}$ has indeed called for more attempts to improve it than anything else and it is not hard to see why later a work like the Siddhāntakaumudī was so eminently successful.

The first European contacts with Pānini's work in the 18th century were indirect, through popular handbooks based on Pānini's analysis until soon afterwards Henry Th. Colebrooke mastered the original text and translated it. ${ }^{117}$ But only Otto v. Böhtlingk gained for Pānini his rightful place in the centre of Indological studies; after his first edition of 1839/40, it was his second edition of 1887 with translation, notes and detailed indices that has been the main tool of research in this field. While his translation has been variously improved

since, the important indices are still unrivaled. ${ }^{118}$ In a period rich in acrimonious debates, Theodor Goldstücker challenged many established doctrines and their proponents in his 'Pānini: his place in Sanskrit literature' (1861); the elegance of his style has gained some of his ideas a longer life than they deserve, especially in India where his arguments are still being refuted. Even though Franz Kielhorn's work centered around the Mahābhāsya he furthered the study of Pānini's work as well by investigating the ways in which Pānini's sūtra-s have been amended and supplemented by later grammarians, and by clarifying the inner workings of the grammar.

Acquaintance with the Pāṇinian analysis of root and suffixes and his recognition of ablaut-though only indirect via Ch. Wilkins' Sanskrit Grammarinspired Franz Bopp and others to develop the imposing structure of IndoEuropean comparative and historical linguistics. The generality of phonetic and morphophonemic rules was rigidly established only in the last decades of the 19th cent.; at about the same time the notion of 'becoming' gave way to that of 'substitution.' A purely grammatical description of language and a formalized set of derivational strings are hotly debated issues today. ${ }^{119}$ It is a sad observation that we did not learn more from Pānini than we did, that we recognized the value and the spirit of his 'artificial' and 'abstruse' formulations only when we had independently constructed comparable systems. The Indian New Logic (nauya nyāya) had the same fate: only after Western mathematicians had developed a formal logic of their own and after this knowledge had reached a few Indologists, did the attitude towards the nauya nyāya school change from ridicule to respect. A striking example of how we only understand what we already know is the frequent translation of varna as 'letter' by F. Kielhorn and others who followed the Western grammatical tradition at least in their choice of words, while the linguistically inclined O. v. Bōthlingk at the same time correctly used 'Laut' (e.g. in his translation of I 39 and in the index under varna).

The last decades have seen a revival of Pāṇinian studies both in India and the West (notably in the U.S.A.). This stretches from antiquarian interest ${ }^{120}$ to

# Chapter III 

## YĀSKA

The ancient science of nirukta 'etymology' is for us more or less synonymous with the work of Yāska. The Nirukta is a commentary on the Nighanțu, a Vedic glossary in five chapters. The first three chapters give groups of synonyms in the way of the later kośa-s (mostly nouns, but there are also a few groups of verbs given in the 3 rd person singular). ${ }^{1}$ The fourth chapter has three largegroups of rare forms and of homonyms and the fifth contains classes of divine names. No author is named for this glossary. ${ }^{2}$

After a lengthy introduction (I 1 to II 4), Yāska offers a running commentary: in II 5 to III finis he comments on the synonym lists of Nighanțu I-III, though not on every word given there; the three batches of odd forms from Nighanțu IV are treated in chapters IV to VI, and the six classes of divine names (Nighanțu V), in chapters VII to XII, preceded by a lengthy discussion on theology at the beginning of chapter VII. ${ }^{3}$

The text of the Nirukta has come down to us in a shorter and a longer version; the word-for-word commentary ${ }^{4}$ of Durgasimha (c. 13th cent. A.D.), written in a Jammu hermitage, represents a third still shorter version. A study of the versions shows that the text grew through many small insertions and a new chapter of Addenda (parisişta; later split into the two chapters XIII and

[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The first of these chapters deals with the physical world, the second with man and the third with abstractions.
    ${ }^{2}$ On the basis of Nirukta VII 13 samāmane 'I enlist . . .,' B. Bhattacharya [Yāska's Nirukta (Calcutta, 1958), p. 31-33] assumes that Yāska is also the author of the Nighanțu; but Nirukta I 1 states: samāmnāyah samāmnātah; sa vyākhyātavyah "A traditional list has been handed down; it is to be explained."
    ${ }^{3}$ The first half of the Nirukta (chapters I to VI) is called naigamam kāndam in the colophone; the latter (chapters VII to XII), daivatam kāndam.
    ${ }^{4}$ It is curious that Durgasimha refused to explain the Rgveda stanza III 53, 23 quoted in Nirukta IV 14: "The stanza in which this word (i.e. lodham) occurs is hostile to Vasisṭtha and I am a descendant of Vasisṭtha, belonging to the Kapiṣthala branch; hence I do not explain the stanza" yasmin nigama esa śabdah sa Vasisthadvesinī rk. aham ca Kāpisthalo Väsisṭhah. atas tām na nirbravimi. The oldest extant commentary is that of Skandasvāmin. K. Kunjunni Raja, ALB 28.250-262, reports on a fragment of Nilakanṭha's Nirukta-ślokavārttika written in Kerala (14th c. or earlier). The Nirukta-bhāṣya of Ugrabhūti or Ugrācārya (18th c.) has not yet been edited.
XIV) still unknown to Durgasimpha. ${ }^{5}$ Even the text commented on by Durgasimpha contains insertions and this author frequently mentions variant readings. ${ }^{6}$

The question of Yāska's date has so far not been settled. All that can be said with safety is that he is older than Patañjali and the ślokavārttika-s quoted by him in his discussion of Pān III 31 (Mahābhāsya II 138, 3-19). Yāska is also quoted repeatedly in the Bṛhaddevatā. ${ }^{7}$ But the crucial question is his relation to Pānini. The first impression of Western scholars was that Yāska must be older because his outlook is ritualistic and his treatment of language primitive when compared with that of Pānini. But these arguments are not conclusive: theories in parallel sciences need not develop in lockstep. Pānini's knowledge of a name Yäska (Pān II 463 ) proves nothing.
P. Thieme ${ }^{8}$ has pointed out that Yāska, when he refers to regular formations, frequently betrays a familiarity with Pāṇinian technique and terminology. He does know the concept of the root because he explains the gerund gatvā 'having gone' as an example of the loss of a final sound ([gam $>g a]+t v \bar{a}$, II 1); and he is aware of the suffix classes called krt and taddhita (primary and secondary suffixes, II 2). When Yāska mentions the loss of the initial vowel of the root $\sqrt{a s}$ 'be' in the nivṛttisthāna-s (II 1) he speaks the language of the ancient Pāniniya-s: the basic injunction to substitute a guṇa vowel is 'turned away' (nivṛtti) before certain suffixes, i.e. we have the weakest grade-Yāska's expression presupposes a rule like Pānini VII 384 being 'turned away' by a rule like Pānini I 15 : $s$-tah, $s$-anti.

While this is no proof that Yāska refers to Pānini's work rather than to that of a forerunner of Pānini, it shows that the apparent archaism of the Nirukta is not "Pānini in the making,"9 but the special (in some ways conservative) position of the etymologists. In several instances the wording of the Nirukta and the Astādhyāyī is very close or even identical: the definition parah samnikarsah samhitā "The closest conjunction is [called] connected [speech]" is

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ In some manuscripts of the commentary there is an additional section commenting on the parisiṣta.
    ${ }^{6}$ Devarājayajvan in the introduction to his commentary on the Nighanțu (probably older than Durgasimha) also describes the poor state of the tradition of that text [L. Sarup, The Nighanțu and the Nirukta (Lahore, 1927), pt. II, p. 10].
    ${ }^{7}$ Embarrassingly, most references are not found in our Nirukta (B. Bhattacharya, Yāska's Nirukta, Calcutta, 1958, p. 46-56). When Kātyāyana (vārttika 15 on Siva-sūtra 5) recognized the transmutation of sounds (varna-vyatyaya) as an etymological principle, he likely summarized Nirukta II 1 [P. Thieme, Pānini and the Veda (Allahabad, 1935), p. 18, fn. 2]. On the other hand, S.D. Laddu (VIJ 5.58-62) suggests that Yāska may be younger than Kātyāyana.

found both in the Nirukta I 17 and Pānini I 4 109. Twice Yāska uses a determinative: in XI 24 the prefix $\bar{a}$ is technically called $\bar{a}^{4}$ as in Pānini I $320^{10}$ and in II 2 he derives kaksa 'armpit' from the root $g \bar{a} h$ with a suffix ${ }^{k} s a$. Though Pānini nowhere teaches such a suffix, he refers in VII 29 to an $u^{9}-\bar{a} d i$ (?) suffix $s a$ (as in vat-sa 'yearling, calf'). It means little that our Un-ādi-sūtra 342 derives kaksa from the root kas with a suffix sa because these sūtra-s are of a much later period. While we cannot be certain that Yāska knew Pānini, he must have known a grammar so close to the Aṣtādhyāyī as to be almost identical with it. Considering that Pānini lacks familiarity with the White Yajurveda (studied in the more eastern parts of India) while Yāska quotes from all branches of the Yajurveda, it is not hard to assume that Pānini preceded Yāska and did not know his work.

The most interesting part of the Nirukta is for us the detailed introduction in which Yāska defines his aims and methods. In the course of these discussions he gives us more information on early grammatical studies than any other author. This is all the more valuable as two of these earlier scholars, Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya, are also mentioned in the Aṣtādhyāyī, showing they definitely preceded both Pānini and Yāska. Almost ${ }^{11}$ all other information on pre-Pāṇinian grammarians in later literature is suspect.

Set against Pānini's formal-grammatical attitude, Yāska's interest in philosophy is remarkable. He gives in Nirukta I 1 a possibly traditional classification of words: noun, verb, prefix and particle; the first two are established by definitions, the remaining by enumeration. Though the noun is named first, the verb is evidently more important and is dealt with before the noun. ${ }^{12}$ The verb has 'becoming' (bhāva) as its basic notion, the noun has 'existing thing' (sattva); ${ }^{13}$ if there should be two expressions for 'becoming' the one with a time sequence will be expressed by a verb, the consolidated whole by a noun (pacati 'cooks' vs. pakti 'cooking'). Then Yāska suggests a formal characterization: "adas 'that' is a reference to existing things: cow, horse, man, elephant; bhavati 'becomes' [is a reference] to becoming: sits, sleeps, goes, stands." ${ }^{14}$ This anticipates Patañjali's statement that a verb denotes 'action' because it is in potential congruence with the verb 'to do': kim karoti? pacati "What does he do? He cooks;" or that it denotes 'being' because of its congruence with the verb 'to be': bhavati

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ Yāska derives the word āgas 'sin' from yigam with the prefix $\bar{a}$ : 'that which comes.'
    ${ }^{11}$ Patañjali and a verse quoted by him (Mahābhāṣya II 281.3-5) have some apparently authentic information on a rule of Āpiśali.
    ${ }^{12}$ nāman 'noun' precedes of necessity $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ 'verb'in the compound nāmākhyāte 'noun and verb' because it has less syllables.
    ${ }^{13}$ J.A.B. van Buttenen, JAOS 77.104; cf. Vākyapadīya III 135 where kriy $\bar{a}$ and sattva are characterized as having and lacking sequence, respectively.
    ${ }^{14}$ ada iti sattvānām upadeśah: gaur aśvah puruṣo hastiti. bhavatiti bhāvasya: āste éste vrajati tiṣṭhatīti (Nirukta I 1).
pacati "It is [that] he cooks." ${ }^{15}$ Yāska's association of the noun with sattva and the verb with bhāva has been quoted in the Rgveda-prātisāāhya XII 5 (18-19), Bṛhaddevatā II 121, Arthaśāstra II 10, 16 and Vākyapadīya II 342; often we find dravya 'thing' instead of sattva, and kriy $\bar{a}$ 'action' instead of bhāva, e.g. Mahābhāsya II 418, 14-16, Bṛhaddevatā I 44/45, Arthaśāstra II 10, 17 and Vākyapadīya II 342.

In contrast it is remarkable that Pānini has kept philosophical notions out of his grammatical description; exceptions are only apparent. While the adjectives stoka 'little,' alpa 'small,' etc. often denote an 'existing thing' (sattva; e.g. stokena visena 'with a little poison'), ${ }^{16}$ there are instances when they do not; the ablative ending may be used to express the semantic notion 'instrument:' instrumental stokena or ablative stokät 'hardly, with difficulty' (Pānini II 333 . . . a-sattva-vacanasya). The interest of this problem reaches far beyond grammar. A certain similarity of some Indian philosophical systems (notably Nyāya and Vaiśesika) with ancient Greek thought has struck many observers, especially when these were contrasted with Chinese, etc. philosophies. Historical contact between India and the Hellenistic world can explain at best only single features-and the skepticism of scholars regarding such borrowing is mounting. The independent emergence of the categories substance, quality and action in the two traditions has been attributed to the common structure of their language: the existence of substantives, adjectives and verbs led, it is supposed, to the first three metaphysical categories; ${ }^{17}$ and grammar is assigned a leading role in this development. Without passing judgement on the role of language itself, ${ }^{18}$ the role that grammatical science actually played has been reversed. The adjective was often not recognized as a main word class but was included in nāman 'noun' as a special group; ${ }^{19}$ the particles on the other hand, correspond to no metaphysical category. Philosophical categories and terms are introduced

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ This notion was further developed by Bhartṛhari, Vākyapadīya III 4, 3. Compare with this the remark of the American logician, W.v.O. Quine: "To be assumed as an entity is, purely and simply, to be reckoned as the value of a variable. In terms of the categories of traditional grammar, this amounts roughly to saying that to be is to be in the range of reference of pronouns" [From a logical point of view, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, 1961), p. 13, quoted by B.K. Matilal, Epistemology, logic, and grammar in Indian philosophical analysis (The Hague, 1971), p. 110, fn. 17].
    ${ }^{16}$ More specifically they refer to the qualities of things (gunavacana) which they follow in gender and number (vārttika 6 on IV 13 ); but a quality may also be expressed by a noun as Patañjali points out: gāvo dhanam "Cows [are his] wealth" (Mahābhāsya II 356.18 f .).
    ${ }^{17}$ B. Faddegon, The Vaiçesika system (Amsterdam, 1918), p. 108-110; J.F. Staal, BSOAS 23.109-122 and PhE\&W 15.104f.
    ${ }^{18}$ For the category 'generality' there is no grammatical counterpart, and note that 'action' is exemplified in Mahābhāsya I 1, 7f. by verbal nouns like ingitam, etc. Cf. also H. von Glasenapp, Entwicklungsstufen des indischen Denkens (Königsberg, 1940), p. [1] - [3].
    ${ }^{19}$ Patañjali's guna-sabda (Mahābhāsya I 19, 20; 316, 23, etc.) and guna-vacana (Pānini etc.) come close to our notion of an adjective; but even then the category is not primarily grammatical. Cf. S.D. Joshi, JUP 25.19-30.
into grammar: ${ }^{20}$ dravya 'substance,' guṇa 'quality,' kriyā 'action' (besides sattva and bhāva)—not grammatical notions into philosophy: nāman 'noun,' ākhyāta 'verb' and dhātu 'root' remain just grammatical terms.

Regarding the prepositions, Yāska notes the controversy between Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya: ${ }^{21}$ do prepositions have a meaning of their own or not? Then he lists 20 prepositions (upasarga), each with one or two nouns indicating their value. This list (Nirukta I 3) corresponds materially if not in sequence to that given in the Vājasaneyi-prātiśākhya VI 24, Ṛgveda-prātiśākhya XII 6 (20), Pāṇinīya Gaṇapāṭha prādayah.

Particles are of three kinds: comparative, conjunctive, verse filler (Nirukta I 4); the latter term is secondarily expanded to 'sentence filler' (I 9), though a sentence has-contrary to a verse-no fixed frame that must be filled. It is surprising that the Indian grammarians with their astute observation have accepted so many meaningless fillers. ${ }^{22}$

Of these four word classes, a special relationship exists between the first two, i.e. nouns and verbs: the nouns can be derived from the verbs (or the roots behind them). ${ }^{23}$ Again Yāska notes the opposing standpoints of Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya, clearly siding with Śākaṭāyana: all nouns can be thus derived. Gārgya and some of the grammarians derived only those nouns where accent, formation and derivational modification ${ }^{24}$ (viz. of the root) were regular. Gārgya's arguments are given and refuted one by one (I 1 12-14). Though Yāska argues here the theories of Śākaṭāyana and Gārgya, it is by no means certain or even likely that he literally reproduced their argumentation.

The term used to denote word derivation is pradeśa as in the following argument of an opponent. "And it is said: the existing thing precedes becoming; the derivation (or: designation?) of the earlier from becoming-which is later-is not possible [and hence nouns cannot be derived from verbs]." ${ }^{25}$ The derived form is characterized by the appropriate accent and suffix, and is accompanied

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ The old categories of past, present and future (above, p. 80) were not grammatical but philosophical in nature.
    ${ }^{21}$ Kātyāyana (vārttika 7 on I 3 1) sides with Gārgya: prepositions modify the action. The controversy, whether prepositions modify the root meaning or only illuminate a shade of meaning already present in the root, was carried on in later grammatical literature; cf. Mahābhāsya III 93.21-94.1 on the question what the root joins with first: preposition or suffix.
    ${ }^{22}$ Cf. the Tamil grammars' acai-nilai and acai-ccol.
    ${ }^{23}$ An exception would be the onomatopoetic words, especially bird names (Nirukta III 18); the followers of Upamanyu denied the existence of onomatopoetic words.
    ${ }^{24}$ vikāra. The longer version and Durgasimpha in 3 out of 5 occurrences have guṇa instead (and so also Śabarasvāmin on Mīmāṃsā-sūtra X 434) which may have been an explaining gloss; cf. L. Sarup, The Nighanṭu and the Nirukta, pt. II, p. 222 f. Yāska uses vikāra also for the lengthening of the vowel in rājan: rājā (II 1).
    ${ }^{25}$ athāpi sattva-pūrvo bhāva ity āhuh. aparasmād bhāvāt pūrvasya pradeśo nōpapadyata iti (Nirukta I 13).
by prādesika vikāra 'derivational modification. ${ }^{28}$ If all these features are present in a fitting manner, etymology is easy. If not, one shall explain a word on the basis of the meaning it has in a given context without excessive regard for its formation; in extreme cases the similarity of a single sound or syllable is regarded sufficient. Never is one to abandon the effort to etymologize (II 1). And etymologize he does: kaksa 'armpit' is derived from $\sqrt{g a ̄ h}$ 'plunge into' with the suffix ${ }^{k} s a$; or from $\sqrt{k h y a}$ ' make known' with redundant reduplication: 'what is there worth seeing?'; or it is derived from $\sqrt{k a s}$ 'rub against' (II 2).

If the words' meanings are uniform, their etymologies are uniform; if their meanings are multiform, their etymologies are multiform (II 7). This theory led to the assumption of an excessive number of homonyms with the possibility of metaphor, specialization, etc. being neglected. ${ }^{27}$ The distinction of descriptive and naming nouns was known to Yāska as the following debate shows. An objection to etymology was raised: every person who performs a certain action should be named after it; and a thing or person should be named after all the actions performed by it or him. ${ }^{28}$ This objection is countered by the argument that in some cases a word is used descriptively for everybody and everything that fits the meaning-and then often this is not the case when the meaning has been narrowed down to a certain item.

One of the motives for the study of etymology is that, without it, the Vedic verses cannot be understood. For Kautsa and his followers this claim was not convincing: he believed the Veda-s to be free of ordinary meaning. Powerful magic formulae, they must be applied according to the dictates of the sacred texts to be effective, but their efficacy is not dependent on any meaning seen in their words. Besides, these words are different in many ways from those of ordinary speech, their sequence is unalterably fixed and their meanings often appear to be contradictory. Against Kautsa, Yāska maintains that the language is the same and that apparent obscurities can be explained by metaphor, hyperbole, etc. But Yāska misses the point when he compares the rigidity of the Vedic texts (a closed corpus!) with word order rules pertaining to spoken language. Neither Kautsa nor Yāska imply any critique of the Veda-s, but the dispute has occasionally been taken by modern scholars as a sign of emerging anti-Vedic skepticism; ${ }^{29}$ in reality it only exhibits the same mechanistic-magical attitude towards the ritual as so many late-Vedic texts. ${ }^{30}$

The bulk of the Nirukta, though of considerable interest in other respects, falls outside the theme of this survey. If Yāska's etymologies are often primitive and tortured and if they lack the perspicuity of Pānini's analysis, we must consider that Yāska dealt with different language material: with the words that did not yield to Pānini's methods because they were isolated and whose make-up could only be explained perhaps by modern comparative and historical linguistics.
# Chapter IV 

## SHADOWS OF SOME EARLY THEORISTS

The philosophical interpretation of grammar was pursued by two authors whose works have not survived, Vājapyāyana and Vyādi. Both are mentioned by Kātyāyana in his vārttika-s 35 and 45 on Pānini I 2 64. Vājapyāyana held the view that words denote the 'form' or universal because a word evokes a general picture of its objects beyond special features, just as the traditional rules have general value: e.g. "Do not kill a Brahmin" means "nobody shall kill any Brahmin." Vājapyāyana guards against the assumption that the single object is the meaning of words because that would make general statements and commands impossible. But that is exactly what Vyādi proposes: all orders are actually carried out with individual objects, and statements such as "The dog died," are valid individually but not for the whole race of dogs. It is not surprising that Kātyāyana in summing up the arguments sides with Vājapyāyana. The Mīmāṃsā has always held that words denote universals because this assumption met its need for universal rules; and the Vedic scholar Kātyāyana regarded grammar as a dharma-sāstra (vārttika 1, introduction).

The contrast to the individual 'thing' is the universal 'attribute' or 'quality' and thus Vājapyāyana's theory was developed into a conception of syntax as an 'association of qualities;' 'the white cow' denotes the association (samsarga) of whiteness and cow-ness, and as both reside in one place (i.e. the cow) the words form a syntactic unit in conformity with grammatical rules. How much of these doctrines (found in works of the classical period) goes back to Vājapyāyana himself is not known, even if they are occasionally ascribed to him, ${ }^{1}$ because his work was probably long lost. While there may have been a line of tradition we know nothing about, these doctrines can be just logical extensions of the well-known position of Vājapyāyana's that words denote universals.

We know more about Vyādi; his followers were called vyādīya-s ${ }^{2}$ or sāmgraha-sūtrika-s; ${ }^{3}$ his work apparently was called the Samgraha ${ }^{4}$ which may be a short form for Samgraha-sūtra. It dealt principally with the question of whether the

language sounds (including words) are permanent (nitya/siddha) or made (kārya, i. e. of a passing nature). ${ }^{5}$ Patañjali's sentence "Beautiful is Dākṣāyaṇa's work, the Samgraha" ${ }^{6}$ shows the high esteem in which the Samgraha was held, but there remains one uncertainty: while both problems, i.e. the permanence of words and the meaning of words, are closely related and could well have been the subject of one and the same work, there is no definite link between the passages quoted. Patañjali does not say that Vyädi was the author of the Samgraha nor does he say that Vyaḍi had the patronymic Dākṣāyaṇa (which could make Vyādi a distant relative of Pānini through Pānini's mother Dākṣī). The earliest extant testimony for Vyādi's authorship of the Samgraha is Bhartṛhari's remark in his commentary on Mahābhāṣya I 6, 22.7 If this Vyādi is identical with the one cited several times in the Rgveda-prātiśākhya (III $14+17$; VI 12f.; XIII 15), we would get the picture of a scholar who is basically a linguist. Indeed, his contention that words denote things reflects the attitude of everyday speech better than Vājapyāyana's theory and it is more compatible with grammatical categories. ${ }^{8}$ The question of whether words are permanent or notwhich was so important for the Mīmāṃsā-was apparently left undecided after Vyādi weighed the pros and cons: all that mattered for him was that either way one must study grammar (Mahābhāṣya I 6, 13f.).

From Patañjali's remarks we can conclude that he perhaps had the Samgraha still before him and even expected his reader to be familiar with it. But all later references are suspect, the work having perished as Bhartṛhari tells us. ${ }^{9}$ Its stupendous size alone was remembered: it dealt with 14,000 matters ${ }^{10}$ and had 100,000 verses. ${ }^{11}$ Detailed statements on Vyādi's theory of language in Helārāja's commentary on the Vākyapadīya can be logical extensions of his known theorems and the numerous quotations from the Samgraha in Bhartrhari's own vṛtti on the Brahma-kāṇda of the Vākyapadīya can hardly have been taken from Vyādi's work-also they are never linked to the name Vyādi. The tone and level of discussion in these quotations are so similar to Bhartṛhari's own that it is hard to believe they could have been taken from a text older

It is to be expected that Bhartṛhari quotes his teacher sometimes, and therefore I propose to see in these quotations from a Samgraha the tribute he pays his guru. A systematic study of these quotations is still wanting.

In contrast to Vājapyāyana's concept of association, Vyādi's is said to be a theory of exclusion (bheda): ${ }^{12}$ a word denotes a 'thing' to the exclusion of all other things. Thing or substance must be taken in this context in a wider sense because it includes theoretical constructs such as universals, fictional objects, etc. An indication of this kind of thinking in an early period can be obtained from the dicussion in the Mahābhāsya II 367,14-23; because of the non-Pāṇinian enigmatic term varti( $n$ ), ${ }^{13}$ it is likely that Patañjali relies here on a foreign source. While there is no problem in attaching the suffixes -tva or -t $\bar{a}$ '-ness' to words like vṛkṣa 'tree:' vṛkṣatva or vṛkṣatā 'tree-ness' it is feared that the rule cannot operate for words like śukla 'white' to obtain śuklatva or śuklatā 'whiteness' because they are not or have not varti( $n$ ). Words like vṛkṣa denote (primarily) a thing and (secondarily) a quality; ${ }^{14}$ the suffix is added to the word in its primary meaning of a thing-which is not possible in the case of śukla 'white.' And yet, it is-if we assume the loss of an imaginary suffix -mat 'having . . .'; then the adjective śukla 'white' is really short for śuklamat '[a thing] having white' and we can attach the suffixes -tva and -t $\bar{a}$ after the basic śukla. The underlying notion is evidently that things are associated with an implied quality which can also be directly expressed with the abstract noun and treated like a thing; but this cannot be so in the case of adjectives: a quality cannot have a quality. Therefore the attempt is made to treat adjectives as nouns plus zerosuffix. The philosophical interpretation of grammar leads to a distortion of the grammatical description. ${ }^{15}$

## THE PRĀTISĀKHYA-S

The analysis of the Vedic samhitä-s in their respective padapatha-s (and the subsequent reassembling of the samhitä-pätha-s from the pada-patha-s) implied a thorough knowledge of the sandhi procedures, i.e. the ways in which isolated (abstracted) words interact when joined in a sentence. To attain their goal of perfect preservation of the sacred texts, the Veda students required also a sound knowledge of pronunciation techniques. This was a concern for every school (parişad/parşad) or branch (šăkhā) of the Vedic tradition and hence the manuals devoted to this task are called pārsada or prātisākhya. As a matter of procedure they start with the (historically later) 'word-for-word recitation' and give rules on how to construct from it the 'text in continuous recitation:' "The school-treatises of all schools are based on [the recitation of isolated] words." ${ }^{1}$ A notable exception to this pattern is the third chapter of the Taittirīyaprātisākhya which gives rules in the opposite direction, viz. how vowels that appear long in continuous Vedic recitation are short in the word-for-word recitation (and for that matter, also in ordinary language).

The chronology of these texts has been hotly disputed for over a century and is not finally settled. Of at least four Prātisākhya-s (Rgveda Pr., Taittirīya Pr., Vājasaneyi Pr., Bktantra), one or the other has variously been acclaimed as the oldest. But three of these texts (Rgveda Pr., Taittirīya Pr., Bktantra) are, in the opinion of some scholars, the youngest of all Prātisāakhya-s. The question of their relative chronology is so hard to decide because the Prātisākhya-s-despite their identical basic aim-differ greatly in design. ${ }^{2}$ This is a result of their being school manuals in very conservative traditions. Besides, each Prātisākhya had to address itself to the problems of its samhitä. For the same reasons it is so difficult to relate them to the works on grammar and etymology. L. Renou ${ }^{3}$ has pointed out the great number of technical terms formed from the root $g r h$ (pragraha, avagraha, udgrāha, grahana, etc.) in the Prātisākhya-s which contrasts with the extensive use of derivatives from the root $k r$ (kartr, karman, kāraka, krt, etc. $)^{4}$ in grammar. We have here two very different scholastic

traditions; and yet, occasional identical sūtra-s and frequent agreements in their expressions show that they were not isolated.

The basic question for modern scholars has been the relation of the Prātisākhya-s to Pānini. The belief in the continuous progress of mankind seemed to have the answer: the less scientific Prātisāakhya-s, each concerned only with its respective samhitā in its outward form and often formulated in a clumsy style, had to be earlier than Pānini's grammar with its wide outlook and concise formulation. But it soon became evident that at least some of the Prātisākhya-s were quite familiar with Pānini's work. Caturādhyāyikā I 88 mentions (without explanation or definition!) stems ending in -vas ${ }^{u}$ which is the form in which Pānini teaches the suffix of the part. perf. act. -vāms; ${ }^{5}$ the same Prātisāakhya gives in I 87 three roots in their abstract form (sān, mān, dān) as Pānini III 16 does even though only one of them (viz. mān) occurs in the Atharvaveda for which the Prātisākhya is intended; and in II 84 it treats yusmad as the base form of all pronouns of the 2nd person and regards tvam te, etc. as substitutes (ādesa) following closely Pānini's procedure. The sūtra-s 195-218 of the Rkktantra-vyākaraṇa are nearly identical with Pānini's VI 1 135-157.

In marked contrast with these two are the Taittirīya Pr. and the Rgveda Pr. which strictly avoid grammatical expressions. The Taittirīya Pr. went to the limit; it explained forms like rakṣāmsi 'protections' or jyotīmsi 'lights' by prescribing the insertion of a nasal after $/ \bar{a} /, \beta /$ and $/ \bar{u} /$ whenever followed by /si/ or /si/, and then removing the verbal forms dadāsi 'you give,' dadhāsi 'you put,' etc. as exceptions in a following rule (XVI $14+18$ ): all that in order to avoid the grammatical classification in 'nouns' and 'verbs'! It is unbelievable that its author was ignorant of this ancient division and, therefore, his attitude reveals rather a sophisticated restraint ${ }^{6}$ than primitive clumsiness. His phonetic knowledge is greater than that found in other Prātisākhya-s, e.g., in the remark on the degree of nasality in nasal consonants (chapter XVII) and the remarkable formulation nāsikā-vivarañād ānunāsikyam "Nasal quality is given by the unclosing of the nose" (II 52). 'Continuous speech,' which Pānini I 4109 had defined as 'closest contiguity' (parah samnikarṣah samhitā), is explained as 'that which is within the compass of a single breath' eka-prāna-bhāve (V 1).

One can classify the Prātisākhya-s by the degree in which they show the influence of grammar: Rgveda Pr. and Taittirīya Pr., the least; Vājasaneyi Pr., more; Caturādhyāyikā, Rkktantra and perhaps Atharvaveda Pr., the most. But does this allow any inference on their relative chronology or their relation to Pānini? How little the use of popular terms counts as an argument is proven by the occurrence of the popular expressions svara 'vowel,' samdhy-akṣara

'diphthong,' ghosavat 'voiced,' etc. in a late grammatical work such as the Kātantra. Rather than comparing intellectual levels or styles we must look for improvements of detail, either formal or material.

The starting point for such investigations must be the Vājasaneyi Pr. because it has the greatest affinity to Pānini. A few of its sūtra-s are identical with Pānini's; but they allow hardly any inference about the direction of borrowing. Many others are so similar that they invite comparison. The appearance is often that of a concise rule of Pānini's corresponding to a longer ('loose' or 'diffuse') rule in the Vājasaneyi Pr.; but the picture changes when we look behind the appearance. Pānini I 19 defined tulyäsya-prayatnam sa-varnam "'Of the same group' is what is of equal effort in the mouth:" thus /a/ and / $\bar{a} /$ belong to the same group, and likewise $/ \mathrm{t}, \mathrm{th}, \mathrm{d}, \mathrm{dh}, \mathrm{n} /$ belong to one group because their peculiarities are caused by factors outside the mouth-duration in the first case; aspiration, voice and nasalization (or their absence) in the other. The Vājasaneyi Pr. I 43 is less brief: samāna-sthāna-karaṇāsya-prayatnah sa-varnah "'of the same group' is [a sound that is] of the same place of articulation, the same organ of articulation, and the same effort in the mouth." If this definition is longer, it is also more precise. One could be misled by Pānini's definition to call /t/ and /k/ sa-varna 'of the same group' because both are produced by an occlusion, viz. a contact of the tongue, though their places of articulation are different: $/ \mathrm{k} /$ at the base of the tongue, $/ \mathrm{t} /$ at the alveolae. This concern for a misapplication is not contrived-we find it voiced in the first vārttika on Pānini I 19 by Kātyāyana, the oldest author of the Pāṇinian school whose work we have. The investigation of other parallel rules confirms that the Vājasaneyi Pr. improves on Pānini's formulations but does not achieve or aim for the same intellectual level; after all, this manual addresses itself to ordinary Veda reciters and not to scholars. If this line of reasoning needed any support it can be found by a study of Pānini's source material: his grammar ignores the language of the White Yajurveda (which includes the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā to which the Prātisākhya is an auxiliary). This is primarily due to geographical reasons, Pānini living in the extreme northwest of India and the White Yajurveda at home in the Eastern provinces. Pānini could hardly use the manual of a school he did not know, but the author of the Prātisākhya could draw on a scholarly work that had gained wide acceptance.

The posterity of the Vājasaneyi Pr. to Pānini is the one safe point of Prātisākhya chronology. Its author Kātyāyana is almost certainly identical with the author of the vārttika-s on Pānini's grammar who lived around 250 B.C. ${ }^{7}$ If the other Prātisākhya-s (with the possible exception of the Rgveda Pr.) are later than the Vājasaneyi Pr., the whole genre is much later than earlier estimates assumed: not forerunners of grammar in a 'Vedic age' but works of Veda pandits in the age of the Maurya-s and Suinga-s. And who knows how much of

the so-called Vedic literature may be late, defying the simplistic concept of a definite and closed 'Vedic period'? The lower limit for the Prātisākhya-s would be approximately the time of Patañjali (c. 150 B.C.) who quotes and explains in his Mahābhāsya I 207, 5-10 two sūtra-s of the Taittirīya Pr. (XXII, 9-10) and possibly in Mahābhāsya I 64, 7-9 four sūtra-s of the Caturādhyāyikā (I 29-32). The great number of authorities cited in the Prātisākhya-s suggests that many treatises have been lost, even if we may doubt that each Vedic 'branch' (śākhā) actually had its own Prātisāakhya.
The object of a Prātisāakhya is stated succinctly in Caturādhyāyikā I 1: "Of the four kinds of words-viz. noun, verb, preposition and particle-the qualities exhibited in the combined and in the word-for-word state are here made the subject of treatment." ${ }^{8}$ The Veda reciter had to learn how to constitute the continuous text from the word-for-word text, observing the rules of vowel and consonant sandhi as well as those of accentuation; that included also a correct pronunciation of sounds. The Prātisākhya rules correspond more or less to the sandhi rules in Pānini's grammar, while Pānini does not deal with pronunciation per se. The sandhi rules of the Prātisākhya-s are narrower but more precise than Pānini's because they concentrate on a special text; in fact many rules with their references to specific verses deal with a text in its continuous and its word-for-word form rather than with language. ${ }^{9}$ While Pānini in his quest for generalities could legitimately employ abbreviations like sarvädini 'sarva, etc.,' the Veda reciter required every item spelled out; only the two Prātisākhya-s of the Atharvaveda and the Bktantra make extensive use of abbreviated rules, obviously under the influence of grammar. ${ }^{10}$

The Prātisākhya-s have not adopted Pānini's theory of substitution ("/y/ instead of /i/ before . . .") but follow the popular notion of 'change' (vikära) ("/i/ becomes /y/ before..."); the original sound is generally given in the nominative case, the result of the change in the accusative, e.g. Taittirīya Pr. V 20 nakārah sakāram . . " $/ \mathrm{n} / \ldots$ becomes $/ \mathrm{s} /$ " in accordance with the metarule tam iti vikārah "The accusative denotes the change" Vājasaneyi Pr. I 133.11 The technical genitive à la Pānini is found occasionally under the influence of grammar. The Prātisākhya-s follow Pānini in the use of technical ablatives ('after . . .') and locatives ('before . . .'). The attempt of the Vājasaneyi Pr. to introduce a technical instrumental for an 'insertion' (āgama; in I 137) remained

    ${ }^{9}$ This explains why there are hardly any optional rules in the Prātisākhya-s: the Vedic texts were fixed.

without followers, just as his short terms sim 'simple vowels,' mud 'sibilants', etc.

The main interest of the Prātisākhya-s lies for us in their descriptions of the contemporary pronunciation; also, they serve as a check on the tradition of our manuscripts of the Vedic samhit $\bar{a}$-s. Their phonetic observations were far more to the point than anything achieved in Europe before the last quarter of the 19th century when-largely under the influence of these same Prātisākhya-s -modern phonetics emerged as a science. The places of articulations (i.e. palate, teeth, lips, etc.), the organs (root of the tongue, tip of the tongue, etc.) and accompanying features were clearly separated: those inside the mouth (opening, closure, constriction) contrasted with those outside it (aspiration, voicing, nasalization) even though the role of the vocal cords was not recognized. And yet I hesitate to accept their phonetic description as a true image of old Vedic pronunciation because the main thrust is to meet popular trends as we find them in the Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) dialects. ${ }^{12}$ The Rgveda Pr. devotes a whole chapter (ch. XIV) to faulty pronunciations with rules such as 5 (14) sāntasthānām ādi-lopānta-lopau "In the case of those [consonants] which appear with a semivowel the first or the last [sound] is dropped" or $5(16 / 17)$ anyonyena vyañjanānām virāgo leśena vā vacanam pilanam vā "Mutual colouring of consonants or partial pronunciation or suppression [of consonants]." The MiddleIndic sound law $r>i$ led to uncertainty when to pronounce an original $/ \mathrm{r} /$ : in the last syllable of candra-nirnik we might hear a hypercorrect $/ \mathrm{r} /$ instead of an /i/, in śrniga a popular *śinga [17 (45/46)].

The Prātisākhya-s devote several sūtra-s to 'vowel fractions' (svara-bhakti) which are inserted between an $/ \mathrm{r} /$ or $/ \mathrm{l} /$ and a following consonant, especially a fricative: varsa will be pronounced varsa, arhati will sound like arshati. As these are the forms we commonly find in the MIA dialects (e.g. varisa, arahanta) it is likely that the Prātisākhya-s describe a popular pronunciation of Sanskrit; if this pronunciation should be old, we have so far no way of proving it.

The aspirate pronunciation of stops before sibilants (e.g. vathsa for vatsa, viraphsin for virapsin) is taught in Rgveda Pr. VI 15 (54); Taittirīya Pr. XIV 12; Caturādhyāyikā II 6 (and Kātyāyana's vārttika 3 on Pāṇini VIII 4 48). This too is probably popular pronunciation. ${ }^{13}$ In groups of stops the first is often incompletely pronounced: the /d/ in marudbhih is not exploded [e.g. Rgveda Pr. VI 5 (17)]; ${ }^{14}$ but Vyādi severely restricted this rule to certain situations [Rgveda Pr. VI 12 (43/44)]. Such incomplete articulation or implosion was a necessary stage in the development towards the consonant assimilations which we find in the MIA dialects. Again it is not possible to make any state-

ments about when this incomplete articulation came into use. The explosion of the first stop in certain clusters ${ }^{15}$ is called sphotana 'bursting' (Caturādhyāyika I 103 and II 38).

Besides the rules on incomplete articulation, and with no attempt to contrast or harmonize these doctrines, we find rules on doubling applicable in the same cases: the first member of a consonant group should be pronounced double (sapta: sappta), likewise a consonant in final position (marut: marutt). The earliest reference to doubling is Pānini VIII 447 where optional doubling of the first consonant in a group is accepted; Pānini cites Sākataāyana's opinion that no such doubling takes place in original groups of three or more consonants (VIII 450 ; i. e. in words like Indrah or rāstram). Kātyāyana added in his vārttika 3 on VIII 447 the optional doubling of a final consonant. Doubling of the final consonant is not admitted by Vājasaneyi Pr. IV 114, ${ }^{16}$ Rgveda Pr. VI 2 (7) and Taittirīya Pr. XIV 15, and was apparently limited to certain schools or areas. As I see it, this doubling is an attempt to speak correct academic Sanskrit. Against the common tendency to articulate a final stop incompletely which led to its disappearance in the MIA dialects, the 'correct' pronunciation would stress the explosion and give the impression of a double consonant. The same applies to the initial stop in a consonant cluster: the tendency towards assimilation was checked with a heavy articulation of the first stop.

Comparison with Pānini's grammar reveals another peculiarity of the Prāti-śākhya-s. Pānini composed his work for oral transmission from teacher to pupil; it had to be memorized and all technical implications had to be mastered before it could be used. When his grammar was finally put down in writing, the technical accents and nasalizations were lost because they could not be expressed in the script of the time. The user of a Prātisāakhya on the other hand, would know his Vedic samhitā by heart, but he needed no unusual mastery of the Prātisākhya-certainly nothing that was not contained in the written text. The use of accents is avoided even where clarity and verbal economy would have demanded it: referring to the adverb antáh 'within' (in contrast to the noun ántah 'end') the Vājasaneyi Pr. I 162 says antar an-ādy-udāttam 'the antah that is not accented on the first syllable'- Pānini would simply have read the adverb with its accent. For the authors of the Prātisāakhya-s, pitch accents were no longer a fact of spoken Sanskrit but limited to Vedic recitation.

The Rgveda Prātisāakhya is attributed to Saunaka; it is the only Prātisāakhya completely made up of verses: a medley of tristubh-s, jagatī-s, sloka-s and a few other metres. It is organized in 18 chapters or patala-s over which a mechanical division into three adhyāya-s (with six patala-s each) and varga-s (consisting ge-

nerally of five stanzas each) is superimposed. The ten introductory stanzas are a late addition and have not been commented on by Uvaṭa in his commentary to the Prātisākhya. Closer study of the text shows that it was not cast in one mold. The chapters XVI to XVIII constitute virtually an independent manual of metrics; separate authorship has also been assumed with some hesitation for chapters XIII to XV, and perhaps for chapters XI and XII. The frequently voiced assumption, however, of old pre-Pāṇinian kernels in this Prātisāakhya as well as in others lacks solid proof.

The metrical form led to a larger use of synonyms, finite verb forms and connecting particles but the style is not verbose. The verses can be dissolved into strings of sūtra-like sentences with frequent use of dittoing. ${ }^{17}$ This Prātisāakhya has shunned arbitrarily created terms but employs more common words in a defined technical meaning than any other. Almost every phenomenon of sandhi is called by a special name which is introduced by definition and then never used again in the text: the loss of $/ r /$ in abraví[r] Rāmam is called ' $a$-kāma,' in nṛpati $[r]$ räjate with lengthening of the preceding vowel ( $>$ nṛpati räjate) 'niyata' [IV 9 (30)]. ${ }^{18}$ The technical use of the accusative is taught ${ }^{19}$ but the abbreviated expression made possible by it is sometimes set aside in favour of a non-technical formulation. ${ }^{20}$ The commentator Uvaṭa (11th c. A.D., from Gujerat; he wrote commentaries also on the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā and the Vājasaneyi Pr.) quotes an older commentary (vṛtti) and in fact his remarks seem to be, with the exception of the more independent remarks on the first four or five pațala-s, largely identical with an anonymous Pārsada-vṛtti or (in other manuscripts) Pārsada-vyākhyā. On the ten introductory stanzas we have a brief commentary Varga-dvaya-vṛtti by Viṣnumitra who seems to refer to Uvaṭa's work and hence should be younger. It is remarkable how rarely Sāyana in his commentary on the Rgveda has made use of the Prātisākhya.

The Rktantra-vyākaraṇa, the Prātisākhya of the Sāmaveda, is perhaps the youngest of the true Prātisāakhya-s ${ }^{21}$ for it shows the strongest influence of grammar including extensive use of gana-s ('. . etc.') instead of lists. It is also the shortest with only 287 brief sūtra-s.

The Kṛ̣̣na-yajub-prātisāakhya 'Prātisāakhya of the Black Yajurveda' (ascribed in one manuscript to Kārtikeya) has been labeled the Taittirīya-prātisākhya by W.D.

The Sukla-yajuḥ-prātisāakhya 'Prātisāakhya of the White Yajurveda' or Kātyāyanīya-prātisāakhya is commonly quoted as the Vājasaneyi-prātisāakhya; its author Kātyāyana is almost certainly identical with the author of the Vārttika-s on Pānini'sgrammar. ${ }^{24}$ Each of the eight chapters of the Prātisākhya is closed with the auspicious words vṛddham vṛddhir just as the word siddham concludes every last vārttika in every one of the eight adhyāya-s. Uvaṭa's commentary on this Prātisākhya seems to be later than that on the Rgveda Pr. because his explanations of certain theoretical points have become more sophisticated. ${ }^{25}$ While Uvaṭa comments on the Prātisākhya from the standpoint of a student of the Mādhyamdina branch, the commentator Anantabhaṭta reinterprets it as a manual of his own Kanva recension of the White Yajurveda.

Of the two Prātisākhya-s of the Atharvaveda, the one connected with our vulgate text of this Veda, by some twist of fate, remained virtually unknown until a few decades ago. First a shorter and mutilated version was discovered, and subsequently more complete manuscripts of it became known. The Caturādhyāyikā, published from a single manuscript more than a century ago by W.D. Whitney as the Atharvaveda-prātisākhya, belongs to a lost branch of the Atharvaveda. Because of its last colophon it has also been accepted as the Saunakīya Caturādhyāyikā even though in rule I 8 the opinion of Saunaka is first mentioned and then rejected.

It is hard to say whether Patañjali's sentence upasedivān Kautsah Pāninim "Kautsa came to Pānini as a student" (Mahābhāṣya II 115, 17) refers to the same person or rather to another member of that gotra. Both Prātisākhya-s of the Atharvaveda show strong influence of the techniques of grammar.

## KĀTYĀYANA

Kātyāyana ${ }^{1}$ was not the first to comment on Pānini's Astāathyāyī but his vārttika-s ['remarks on the [teaching] procedure (vrtti)' (?)] ${ }^{2}$ are the first such work that is preserved in its entirety. Their preservation is owed to Patañjali who included them in his 'great work in colloquial language' (mahäbhāşya) and discussed their pros and cons. We have reason to believe that no vārttika has been left out: in the sometimes lengthy discussions (there are 59 vārttika-s on Pānini I 264 and 33 on II 1 1!) we see a logical development of the argument. When Kātyāyana refers about a hundred times to another vārttika with uktam "It has been said"3 this reference can be found (e.g. vārttika 8 on Pānini I 14 refers back to vārttika 4 on the same sūtra); all eight adh$y \bar{a} y a$-s conclude with the auspicious word siddham "it is correct." In isolated cases there may be some doubt as to whether a sentence found in the Mahā-bhāsya-text is a vārttika of Kātyāyana or a statement of Patañjali, but in the overwhelming majority of cases we can recognize the vārttika-s with the help of the criteria developed by F. Kielhorn: the vārttika-s are generally followed by a paraphrase of Patañjali; their nominal sūtra-like style differs from the conversational style of the Mahābhāsya. Their total number is approximately 42934-attached to 1245 of Pānini's circa 4000 rules. There are manuscripts that contain the vārttika-s alone but these are secondarily derived from the Mahā-

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The differentiation between an older mahāvārttikakāra Kātya and a later (and minor) vārttikakāra Kātyāyana made by K.G. Subramaniam, JOR 2.25-33 and V. Raghavan, Bhoja's Srngāra Prakāśa (Madras, 1963), p. 746, is not convincing. There is no support for the later identification of Kātyāyana with Vararuci.
    ${ }^{2}$ Patañjali, Mahābhāsya I 371, 18, contrasts Pānini's vrtti-sūtra-s 'concise rules of procedure' with Kātyāyana's vārttika-s 'remarks on the procedure.' To judge from the expression vārttika-sūtrika 'student of vārttika' (Mahābhāsya II 284, 3f.; not 'student of vārttika and sūtra' MW)-if it refers to students of the same textthe full name would have been vārttika-sūtra 'concise statements relating to procedure.' Cf. P. Thieme, GGA 212.23 f.
    ${ }^{3}$ Frequently this reference is to a vārttika that comes later in the text, e.g. vārttika 9 on Pānini I 13 aṭi cōktam refers to vārttika 5 on Pānini VI 113 and vārttika 6 on I 112 refers to vārttika $9+10$ on VIII 26 . This shows that the whole text of the vārttika-s is supposed to be present in the mind of the student.

bhāsya text. The combined edition of Pānini's sūtra-s with Kātyāyana's vārttika-s ${ }^{5}$ gives an impression of the tradition as it might have appeared to Kātyāyana's successors, but it is likewise secondarily derived.

The careful separation of the vārttika-s from the surrounding text of the Mahābhāsya and their stylistic characterization was the work of F. Kielhorn ${ }^{6}$ whose investigation generally confirmed the Indian grammatical tradition about the separate identity of Kātyāyana's vārttika-s. A vārttika (or the first of several vārttika-s) on a sūtra of Pānini ${ }^{7}$ often carries as a mark of reference the full quotation of Pānini's sūtra ( 131 instances) or the quotation changed only insofar as to allow its being construed with the other words of the vārttika. Otherwise the vārttika contains at least the first word(s) of a sūtra or the special term taught in it. The absence of any such references in a few vārttika-s or other inconsistencies in a few others raise doubts about their status, but the small number of such cases does not justify a general skepticism ${ }^{8}$ against the establishment of Kātyāyana as an author with a separate identity.

More specific was E. Frauwallner's ${ }^{9}$ attempt to prove that at least in one instance a large group of supposed vārttika-s were really inserted by Patañjali from another source into the argumentation of Kātyāyana. In his vārttika-s on Pānini I 2 64, Kātyāyana discusses Pānini's peculiar way of generating dual and plural forms: in the case of two trees (spelled out vkksas ca vkksas ca 'a tree and a tree') the dual suffix $a u$ is used according to Pānini I $422^{10}$ and I $4103 ;{ }^{11}$ before this suffix only one word vkksa remains (Pānini I $264^{12}$ )-vkssau. In his lengthy discussion of the feasibility of this rule I 2 64, Kātyāyana introduces the opposing arguments brought forward by two other scholars, Vājapyāyana and Vyādi (above p. 124-126): the former held that words denote first the universal, the latter on the contrary that they denote single things. Pānini's procedure would obviously imply that he took words to denote single things first-but probably Pānini had taken no principled stand on this question which may

have arisen well after his time. ${ }^{13}$ Kātyāyana sides with Vājapyāyana and his belief in the role of universals; he gives in the vārttika-s $35-44$ the basic arguments of Vājapyāyana, ${ }^{14}$ in vārttika-s $45-52$ one by one Vyādi's counter-arguments and finally, in vārttika-s $53-59$ his own opinion which is similar to Vājapyāyana's: a word denotes the universal which manifests itself in individuals (Mahābhāsya I 242.10-247.16). Frauwallner, who regards the whole discussion on the role of universals as an insertion made by Patañjali, assumed that the original text excerpted by Patañjali proceded not in three but in two steps: first the theory of Vyādi, then Vājapyāyana's theory of universals. His main argument is an apparently senseless repetition of vārttika 40 (in vārttika 56): asti caikam anekâdhikaraṇa-sthaṃ yugapad-itindravad viṣayah "It happens that one thing is simultaneously in several places: the range is like [that of] Indra." ${ }^{15}$

Vārttika 40 is embedded in the Mahābhāsya text and its two parts are separated by Patañjali's paraphrase and discussion of the first part.
"It happens also that one thing is perceived simultaneously as being in several places, e.g. the sun: the one sun is seen simultaneously in several places.-This analogy is not correct because not one and the same viewer sees the sun simultaneously as being in several places.-Then: 'The range is like [that of ] Indra' . . ."

This is repeated, said Frauwallner, in vārttika 56 with accompanying commentary:
na caikam anekâdhikaraṇa-sthaṃ yugapad ity ādityavad viṣayah "[Regarding your statement that] one cannot be simultaneously in several places [I say:] the range (of application) is like the sun."

Patañjali paraphrases the vārttika and continues:
"E.g. the one sun is seen simultaneously as being in several places.-The analogy is not correct because not one and the same viewer sees the sun as being in several places.-Then: The range is like [that of] Indra, ${ }^{16}$ viz. the one Indra who is called at hundreds of rituals is at all [these places] simultaneously. Thus the form (universal) will be at all places simultaneously."

Frauwallner objected to the idea that an example (viz. the god Indra) which is offered in vārttika 40 but replaced by another (viz. the sun) in vārttika 56

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ As Patañjali, Mahābhāsya I 6, 8-11 points out, Pānini's rule I 258 would imply that he saw the universals as the meaning of the word and I 264 , conversely, the individuals.
    ${ }^{14}$ It must be remembered that the formulation of these vārttika-s is Kātyāyana's and that they are probably not literal quotations of Vājapyāyana's and Vyādi's works.
    ${ }^{15}$ God Indra attends many rituals at the same time. Nāgojibhatṭa (18th c. A.D., in his Uddyota on vārttika 40) assumes that it is the word Indra that is invoked at several rituals simultaneously and becomes part of them, a late rationalistic interpretation which he tries to read into the text of the Mahābhāsya.
    ${ }^{16}$ The edition of Joshi, Kupāla and Raghunātha-sāstrin prints the phrase itindravad vişayah as a separate vārttika in both occurrences.
should again be preferred in Patañjali's commentary on both vārttika-s. The problem disappears when we recognize that the editors erred in regarding itindravad viṣayah as a vārttika or part of a vārttika. ${ }^{17}$ Vājapyāyana's postulate asti caikam anekādhikarana-stham yugapad (vārttika 40) was answered by Vyādi's counterclaim na caikam anekādhikarana-stham yugapad (vārttika 48)— both equally unsupported by an example. The latter is then refuted by Kātyāyana in his definite opinion (vārttika 56):
'na caikam anekādhikarana-stham yugapad' ity ādityavad viṣayah "[Regarding your statement that] one cannot be simultaneously in several places [I say:] the range (of application) is like the sun."

That was the end of the argument for Kātyāyana just as it was for the author of Mīmāṃsā-sūtra I 1, 15 yaugapadyam ādityavad "Simultaneousness like [in the case of] the sun." Only Patañjali was not satisfied; if the sun is seen simultaneously in several places this is due to several different viewers, which makes the statement relational and worthless. Instead of ity ādityavad viṣayah "[I say:] the range is like the sun," the vārttika 56 should end itindravad viṣayah "[I say:] the range is like Indra." This use of the particle iti ('regarding your statement that... I say ...') is so typical of Kātyāyana's style that only vārttika 56 can be the original place of the example. With iti Kātyāyana refers back to vārttika 48 just as he so often refers with iti to Pānini's sūtra-s (e.g. on Pānini I 147 ; I 152 , etc.) or with iti ced 'If you say . . . then I say . . .'18 to a hypothetical reasoning. Patañjali was free to mention the examples that were to be introduced later and no further inferences can be drawn from this fact. Thus, a clear understanding of the Mahābhāsya is only possible after a correct separation of Kātyāyana's and Patañjali's contributions.

To determine when and where Kātyāyana lived we depend on incidental references. On Pānini VI 321 ṣaṣthy $\bar{a}$ ākrośe "[Before the second word of a compound there is non-disappearance] of the genitive ending if [the compound] expresses an insult" Kātyāyana's vārttika 3 demands an exception-devānāmpriya, the title of the Maurya kings. The elliptical expression śāka-pārthiva 'vegetable [eating] king,' i.e. 'vegetarian king' in vārttika 8 on Pānini II 1 69, can hardly refer to anybody but Priyadarśin Aśoka and suggests thus a date after 250 B.C. ${ }^{19}$ On the other hand, Kātyāyana cannot have lived much later than that because of the large derived literature (variant readings of the vārttika-s, polemics against them, etc.) quoted by Patañjali (c. 150 B.C.) in his Mahābhāsya.

Scholars have long assumed that Kātyāyana lived in the South, i.e. the Dekkhan, because of a statement of Patañjali. At the end of his very first vārttika Kātyāyana offers a parallel: yathā laukika-vaidikesu ". . . as in secular and Vedic [affairs]." On the question why Kātyāyana did not simply say: yath $\bar{a}$ loke vede ca ". . . as in the world[ly life] and in the Veda," Patañjali suggests a) that Southerners are overly fond of secondary suffixes or b) that perhaps there is a special meaning to the longer formulation. Patañjali's suggestion has been taken by modern scholars as a statement that Kātyāyana was a Southerner but no such statement is implied; all we may conclude is that Patañjali thought it possible that Kātyāyana was a Southerner and that this may explain the unusual formulation. That Kātyāyana indeed lived in the South becomes likely through his vārttika on Pānini VI 373 nalopo na ${ }^{\underline{a}} . a \underline{h}$ "The negation na looses its /n/ [in the beginning of a compound]" (e.g. a-putra 'not a son; sonless') which demands similar negated forms from the verb if an insult is intended:
naa.o na-lope 'vaksepe tiá.y upasaṃkhyānam "In addition to Pānini VI 373 it must also be taught that the /n/ of the negation $n a$ is dropped before a verb form if an insult is intended."

Patañjali gives the examples apacasi vai tvaṃ jālma "You don't cook [right], you fool!" and akaroṣi vai tvaṃ jālma "You don't do it [right], you fool!" Negated verb forms are strange to Sanskrit and the Indo-European languages in general, ${ }^{20}$ but are a common feature of the Dravidian languages. ${ }^{21}$ And if we look at the few examples of such negative forms in Sanskrit texts, ${ }^{22}$ it is striking that two of these texts are definitely from South India: Śankara ${ }^{23}$ hailed from Kerala and the Bhāgavata-purāna (a-spṛhayanti III 25, 37) comes from the Tamil country. Besides, it is noticeable that forms like a-sakkoti 'cannot' are frequent in the later Pāli texts. ${ }^{24}$ One thing is certain: Kātyāyana neither belongs to the West nor to the North of India because of his links with the White Yajurveda ${ }^{25}$ which was not represented in these areas; nor was he an Easterner because in his vārttika 8 on Pānini VII 345 , he postulates the bird name vartaka 'quail' for the 'eastern' dialect while he apparently used vartika-as does the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā XXIV 30.

It is virtually certain that Kātyāyana the Vārttika-kāra is identical with Kātyāyana the author of the Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya of the White Yajurveda. ${ }^{26}$ We have seen above (p. 129) how the Vājasaneyi Pr. I 43 improved on Pānini's definition I 19 :
tulyásya-prayatnam sa-varnam "'Of the same group' is what is of equal effort in the mouth" becomes a cumbersome samāna-sthāna-karaṇāsya-prayatnah sa-varnah "'Of the same group' is [a sound that is] of the same place of articulation, the same organ of articulation and the same effort in the mouth."

The motive for this alteration is voiced in Kātyāyana's first vārttika on Pānini I 1 9: Pānini's definition is too wide as it would extend to stops such as $/ \mathrm{k} /$ and /t/ which are produced through identical (samāna) efforts though at different places. But in his solution he stays as close to Pānini's formulation as possible while removing its shortcomings. He retains the adjective tulya against samāna of the Prātisākhya and proposes in vārttika 2 to read: āsye tulya-deśa-prayatnam sa-varnam "'Of the same group' is what is of equal location and effort in the mouth." The vārttika-s indicate familiarity with the Vājasaneyi Pr. I 43 and must therefore be later; the solution proposed by the vārttika is superior.

Pānini I 19 tulyāsya-prayatnam sa-varnam: concise but not precise
Vājasaneyi Pr. I 43 samāna-sthāna-karaṇāsya-prayatnah sa-varnah: not concise but precise
vārttika 2 on I 19 āsye tulya-deśa-prayatnam sa-varnam: both concise and precise

In the writing of his vārttika-s, Kātyāyana has not been able to free himself completely from the terminology and the attitudes of the Prātisākhya-s. He uses occasionally svara for 'vowel'27 instead of $a^{c}$, sparśághoṣa for 'voiceless stop'28 instead of khay, etc.; we even find śvastani '2nd future suffix'29 instead of Lut and bhavanti 'present tense suffix'30 instead of Lat. Instead of Pāṇinian 'substitution' (ādeśa) of sounds he speaks occasionally of 'change' (vikāra) ${ }^{31}$

I 73 the two components of the diphthongs /ai/ and /au/ are equally one measure (mātrā) long, while according to vārttika 4 on I 148 the diphthongs are made up from $1 / 2$ measure /a/ and $11 / 2$ measures $/ \mathrm{i} /$ and $/ \mathrm{u} /$. This interpretation reads more into the texts than they intend to state. The Prātisākhya merely speaks of the measure of /a/ being guttural, that of /i/ and /u/ palatal and labial, respectively. The vārttika only says that the latter part of the diphthong is greater, which Patañjali, Mahābhāsya I 118, 2 f., explains by saying that "the measure of /i/ and /u/ is greater, the [measure] of /a/ lighter:" the term 'measure' is not used here with the precise time value.

and even uses a technical accusative to denote such a 'change'32 instead of Pānini's genitive of substitution. But Kātyāyana's obligation to Prātisākhya techniques goes still deeper and touches on the basic difference between grammar and Prātisākhya. Grammar strives for scientific generalization, for the essence of things; the Prātisākhya-s look for practical rules to aid the priestly practitioner, with every detail spelled out.

Pānini's rules I 237-38 give rise to a discussion in which Kātyāyana displays his dual approach. The subject is a Vedic mantra of over twenty words, the so-called Subrahmany $\bar{a} .{ }^{33}$ Pānini had succinctly defined the peculiar way in which it is recited: all vowels with (normally) falling tone are chanted in high pitch with the exception of the two words dèväh and bráhmânah at the end of the formula where these vowels are chanted in a low pitch instead. Pānini's description is marred by a technical oversight: several of the falling tones are only secondarily established in one of the very last rules of his grammar (VIII $466^{34}$ ), in that final section of strictly linear rules called the tripadi-hence these falling tones are not available for substitution in I 237 -38. All would be faultless if the rules I $237-38$ would be put after VIII 466 ; but-and that is Kātyāyana's final opinion in his vārttika 5 on I 232 -such transfer of the rules I 237-38 is not necessary because Pānini's procedure indicates that he himself regarded the rules I $237-38$ as if they followed VIII 466 . Kātyāyana argues that it would make no sense otherwise to say that the falling tones of dèväh and bráhmânah are chanted not in the high but in the low pitch because these falling tones are established only secondarily by VIII 466 . This discussion of Kātyāyana, in which he points out a technical flaw, suggests a way to remedy it and finally decides that Pānini himself had already taken care of the problem, is a fine specimen of Pāniniya scholasticism. Under the rule I 237 itself Kātyāyana follows a different course by actually rewriting the whole rule. "In the Subrahmany $\bar{a}$ the vowel /o/ is [always] high pitched" (vārttika 1); "The vowel /ā/ is [always] high pitched before a verb form; also the first of the following [syllables]" (vārttika 2), etc. This is the technique of the Prātisākhya-s: a mechanical enumeration of instances instead of a statement of the salient feature-not a word on the elimination of the falling tone (svarita)!

Kātyāyana's attitude towards Pānini shows great respect; he not only closes every last vārttika of an adhyāya with the auspicious word siddham 'it is correct'-but the whole opus closes with the deferential clause . . . bhagavatah Pānineth siddham "[This formulation] . . . of the venerable Pānini is correct." The definition of a vārttika is in Nāgojībhatṭta's words "The critique of what

If found wanting, emendations or additions are proposed; if found superfluous, their elimination is recommended.

I find the earliest suggestion of a bias against Kātyāyana in Śabarasvāmin's commentary on Mīmāṃsā-sūtra X 84. Śabarasvāmin, who does not accept vārttika 2 on Pānini II 11, rebukes the 'venerable Kātyāyana' for not telling the truth (a-sad-vādin) due to ignorance. Th. Goldstücker went still further in his criticism in his book 'Pānini: his place in Sanskrit literature.' He saw in Kātyāyana a vicious enemy of Pānini and in Patañjali a loyal defender. Such views are not tenable.

The Aṣṭādhyāyī can be compared to a code of law which is subject to legal interpretation ${ }^{36}$ when cases arise that were not or could not be foreseen by the lawmaker. The courts need a consistent and workable application even in such cases. Lawyers are used to obtaining this application by extrapolating principles embodied in the code which is presumed to be comprehensive and consistent to the minute technical details; seemingly redundant features must have their significance. If these extrapolations lead to opposing conclusions, ${ }^{37}$ this contradiction must be resolved. As a last recourse, the law may be amended. The Pāninīya-s are like such lawyers and we miss the point when we castigate them for reading later theories into the original texts. ${ }^{38}$ But the philologist's objective is different. He wants to know what Pānini meant when he formulated his rule, comparable to the historian of law who is interested in the original intent of the lawmaker and the meaning his work had in his time. Instead of being flustered by contradictions that appear in the extrapolations he sees in them the sign of a lively scholarly tradition, an indication of problems that surfaced only after the author's time.

The problem of maintaining consistency in such a large and complex structure as the Aṣṭādhyāyī must have been staggering, much more so than it would have been in a paradigmatic kind of grammar. Add to this the irregularities of a natural language and it was inevitable that there should be contradictions if we attempt to extrapolate the underlying principles. Furthermore, it is in the

nature of unformulated subconscious principles that they are not quite applied with the same consistency as expressed metarules. I might add that our task in interpreting Pānini is not to further embroider the intricate scholastic patterns by new sophisms (phakkik $\bar{a}-\mathrm{s}^{39}$ ) but to cut through to the original material: not a faultless weave as the Pāniniya-s would have it and not quite the automatic device they pretend it to be-it is but a 'thread' and after the loss of the oral instruction that once went with it we must know the results (i.e. Sanskrit) to check our procedure and to avoid wrong forms. ${ }^{40}$

Seven references in the vārttika-s to emendations proposed by 'some' (eke) show that Kātyāyana was not the first to investigate the Aṣtādhyāyī in this fashion. ${ }^{41}$ The śloka quoted in Mahābhāsya II $398,4+13$ might well be older than Kātyāyana. To express possession, Pānini V 2115 teaches the suffixes -in and -ika for noun stems ending in /a/ (e.g. daṇda: daṇdin, daṇdika); the next rules adds the nouns vrīhi, etc. (urīhi: urīhin, urīhika; sikha $\bar{a}$ : sikhin). The verse demands a restriction: sikhädibhya intr vācya ikaa yavakhadädisu "'in must be taught [exclusively] for śikh $\bar{a}$, etc., -ika [exclusively] for yavakhada, etc." Kātyāyana (vārttika 1 on V 2 116) regards the restriction as unnecessary, an apparent polemic against the śloka.

Kātyāyana attached his vārttika-s to Pānini's sūtra-s in their natural sequence in the Aṣtādhyāyī; as the authoritative form of the sūtra-s was their continuous recitation he had considerable leeway in dividing sūtra-s into two: ${ }^{42}$ e.g. he proposes to read the sūtra I $117 / 18 u^{a} \cdot a \bar{u} \bar{m}$ as two: I $117 u^{a} \cdot a h$ and $18 \bar{u} \bar{m}$-an emendation that has been adopted in the vulgate text. In other instances Kātyāyana found a sūtra unnecessary. Pānini I $148 e^{c} . a$ ir ghrasvâdeśe teaches that /i/ and /u/ are substituted for /e, ai/ and /o, au/, respectively, when the substitution of a short vowel is decreed for the latter sounds: citra $+g o>$ citra-gu (I 2 48). The correct substitution can in Kātyāyana's opinion however be effected without the rule I 148 because there is no short /e,ai/ or /o,au/ and because /i/ and /u/ belong to the same group and are therefore the natural substitutes. In this case Kātyāyana's suggestion (in spite of Patañjali's silent consent!) did not prevail in the tradition and the vulgate still contains the sūtra I 148 .

    ${ }^{41}$ F. Kielhorn, IA 16.103.
    ${ }^{42}$ Note that there are but a few suggestions (by Patañjali only) that a word at the beginning of a sūtra may instead belong at the end of the previous rule (KielHORN, IA 16.247) which reveals a basic consensus on the division of the sūtra-s.
Proposed changes in the formulation of sūtra-s are motivated either by logical-technical problems or by additional language material that needed to be covered. An example of the logical problems we have seen in the definition of sa-varna (p. 140); but they are not limited to definition rules. While we easily get vkṣau 'two trees' from vkksas ca vkksas ca 'a tree and a tree' (above p. 136), Kātyāyana sees the need for a special injunction regarding synonyms. We should be able to combine vakra-danda 'someone with a bent staff' and kutiladanda 'someone with a crooked staff' in a single dual form, either vakra-dandau or kutila-dandau 'two people with bent/crooked staves' (vārttika 23 on I 2 64). Technical simplification is the aim of a vārttika on Pānini I 1 34: the listing of the seven direction adjectives can be shortened by a reference to the gana 'word list' attached to I $127 .{ }^{43}$

Regarding the additional language material, we must try to differentiate between additional old Vedic forms and new or regional forms. Pānini's presentation of the Vedic material was highly selective, possibly restricted to forms that occurred in commonly used liturgical texts; for reasons that so far elude us, Kātyāyana included further Vedic material. Pānini VI 321 allows the retention of the genitive suffix for the first member of a compound only when an insult was intended (type dāsyāh-putra '[illegitimate] son-of-a-maid')-Kātyāyana postulates also a non-abusive Divo-dāsa (a name found in the Rgveda) and Devānām-priya (the very recent title of the Maurya kings). Frequently the words or forms postulated by Kātyāyana ${ }^{44}$ are not attested to in any text which makes it virtually impossible to decide between the two kinds of language material. Furthermore, it is possible that Pānini has overlooked certain words or forms or has not thought it necessary to teach them. Forms postulated by Kātyāyana do not, therefore, necessarily indicate linguistic development.

A major morphological development reflected in the vārttika-s is the formation of the periphrastic perfect with $\sqrt{k r}, \sqrt{a s}$ and $\sqrt{b h \bar{u}}$, whereas this perfect in the language of the Brähmaṇa-s (and Pānini) could only be formed with $\sqrt{k r}$ (Pānini III 140 with vārttika 3): pācayām cakāra/āsa/babhūva. Another example: in agreement with older usage Pānini I 111 teaches $\bar{i}^{d}-\bar{u}^{d}-e^{d}$ dvi-vacanaṃ pragrhyam " $\bar{\imath}, \bar{u}$, e/ expressing duality are pragrhya," i.e. must be 'separated' from an eventually following vowel without any sandhi effects. Kātyāyana takes the sūtra to mean that dual suffixes ending in $\bar{\imath}, \bar{u}, \mathrm{e} /$ are pragrhya so as to include the verbal dual forms in - $\bar{u} t h e$, etc. which were not treated as pragrhya in the older language. ${ }^{45}$ The aspiration of stops before sibilants (vatsa $>$ vathsa, etc.) mentioned in vārttika 3 on VIII 448 as the doctrine of Pauskarasādi probably reflects a recent popular pronunciation and corresponds to state-

Kātyāyana, who in his Vājasaneyi Pr. used artificial terms extensively, also developed Pānini's metalanguage. The elements $-i$ and $-t i$ used often by Pānini to denote roots (e.g. ruc-i III 2 136; as-ti II 452 ) are taught in vārttika 2 on III 3108 as $i^{k}$ and $4 t i^{p}$. And in the vārttika-s 5 to 8 on I 168 he proposes four new determinatives ${ }^{48}$ to mark those nouns in Pānini's rules that denote a) also their synonyms, b) only their synonyms, c) only the subspecies or d) both the word itself and its subspecies. ${ }^{49}$

Many of Kātyāyana's vārttika-s deal with the principles of interpretation or construction. Some of these principles have been laid down by Pānini himself, e.g. I 42 vipratisedhe parami kāryam "When there is conflict, the subsequent[ly formulated] rule [takes precedence over the operation provided by a previous rule]" which is valid in the definition section I 41 to II 2 38: each item in this section is allowed only one technical name. Kātyāyana extends the application of this principle through the whole grammar with the exception of the last three $p \bar{a} d a$-s (the so-called trip $\bar{a} d i$, cf. above, p. 101), as a convenient mechanical device: whenever two conflicting rules ${ }^{50}$ tend to apply to a form, the rule given later in Pānini's grammar prevails. The arbitrariness of this extension is shown by the great number of exceptions that call for the contrary principle when 'the conflict is in favour of the former rule' ( $p \bar{u} r v a-v i p r a t i s i d d h a m$ ). ${ }^{51}$ The extension is in fact quite unnecessary for the proper interpretation of Pānini's rules if one admits the validity of several principles of a general logical nature. ${ }^{52}$

The most important of these is this: a special rule that falls completely within the sphere of a general rule supersedes the general rule in its limited area. If this were not so, it could not apply at all and its very existence would be pointless (apavāda overrules utsarga). Another principle refers to the gradual build-up of words from a root and a number of suffixes: the operation within a stem (anga) takes precedence over an operation caused by a further suffix being

That implies that one knows the correct forms beforehand and is guided by this knowledge in the correct application of the grammar.

attached to the stem (antar-anga overrules bahir-anga, e.g. in the instr. sing. fem. patvy $\bar{a}$ from $[\operatorname{patu}+\bar{i}]+\bar{a}$ instead of * patuy $\bar{a}] .{ }^{53}$ These principles are based on sound reasoning and yet their consequent application leads to certain difficulties which Patañjali meets with additional interpretation rules. The relative strength of these basic principles is tested wherever they come into conflict with each other:
"Of (these five kinds of rules, viz.) a preceding (rule), a subsequent (rule), a constant (rule), an intra-stem (rule), and a special rule, each following (rule) possesses greater force (than any one of, or all, the rules which in this metarule are mentioned before it)."54
The loss of the original oral explanation attached to Pānini's sūtra-s led to an intensive search for the principles underlying the grammar so that its rules could be properly applied. This search proceeded on the assumption that Pānini formulated his rules with absolute consistency and parsimony; any apparent deviation from these ideals was meant to indicate the validity of another guiding principle whose usefulness was shown by a number of further applications. ${ }^{55}$ But the assumption of Pānini's absolute consistency (cf. above p. 142f.) and parsimony is not correct; ${ }^{56}$ he states occasionally a general principle even though this could be derived from logic or from a textual 'indication,' ${ }^{57}$ as e.g. Pānini I 156 sthänivad ädeśah . . "The substitute is like the original . . ." The recent Pāṇiniya Nāgojībhatṭa (18th c. A.D.) believes, following a suggestion of Patañjali, that this seemingly unnecessary assertion is in itself an 'indication:' that principles established by logic or by textual indications are not universally valid (jñāpaka-siddham na sarvatra) ${ }^{58}$-by which admission of course the basis for this whole investigation has been severely weakened.
${ }^{53}$ The same is true for operations within a word vs. operations in a sentence. The replacement $|\mathrm{i}|>|\mathrm{u}|$ in the generation of the 3rd. sing. imperative takes precedence over $|\mathrm{i}|>|\mathrm{y}|$ in external sandhi: pacat $[i>u]+a t r a>p a c a t v$ atra. That led to a reinterpretation of the terms antaranga and bahiranga; 'whose conditions are internal and external' (Nāgojībhatṭa, Paribhāṣendu-śekhara on Paribhāṣā 50 beginning); the original term must have contained aniga in the only meaning found in the Aṣṭādhyāyī and the vārttika-s: 'that to which something is suffixed' (Pānini I 4 13). Kātyāyana, vārttika 5 on III 477 , applies the antaranga principle to the above-mentioned case only as an alternative; in vārttika 4 he proposed to see here a 'conflict in favour of the former rule.' In the verse quoted by Patañjali (Mahābhāṣya I 91, 20) from Gonardīya, pratyanga is used instead of antaranga; cf. Nāgojībhatṭa, Uddyota IV 659 (on VI 3 138).

Of Kātyāyana's achievements as a grammarian the addition of new language material has already been mentioned (p. 144f.). He also tried to further Pāṇini's grammatical analysis. ${ }^{59}$ Irregular formations are given at times in the Aṣtādhyāyī as ready-made words without grammatical build-up, e.g. mātāmaha and pitāmaha 'maternal and paternal grandfather' (IV 2 36) which, besides the words mātr 'mother' (nom. sing. mätā) and pitr 'father' (nom. sing. pitā), evidently contain the adjective maha 'great.' Kātyāyana sees instead in the second element a suffix qāmaha (vārttika 2 on IV 2 36)-a rather mechanical way to account for the admittedly unusual formation. In rule V 3 22, Pānini lists isolated time adverbs sadyas 'today,' parut 'last year,' pūredyus 'yesterday,' etc. Kātyāyana's analysis of sadyas as sa- with a 'suffix' dya(s) (vārttika 1) may still be regarded as reasonable in spite of the obvious connection with the root $\sqrt{\text { dyu }}$ and the words for 'day. ${ }^{60}$ But the analysis of pürvedyus in pūrva and a suffix edyusu (vārttika 6) is very artificial: the vowel /e/ certainly belongs to the first element of the word (pürve-dyus). repha 'burr, $r$-sound' is not $r a+$ (suffix) ipha (vārttika 4 on III 3 108) but is derived from the root $\sqrt{r i p h}$ 'snarl' attested to in the Veda. These mechanical divisions fall short of the standards of Pānini's functional analysis and remind one of Yāska's procedure and-carried to an extreme-the analyses found in the Unādi-sūtra-s. Kātyāyana makes frequent use of the disappearance (lopa) of words in secondary word formations. Already Pānini V 382 teaches 'loss of the latter word' (uttara-pada-lopa) when the latter word of vyäghrājina 'tiger skin' (viz. ajina 'skin') is dropped before the secondary suffix $k a^{n}$ : vyäghraka 'man in tiger skin.' Kātyāyana adds the types śāka-pārthiva 'vegetarian king' from śāka-bhojī pārthivah 'vegetable-eating king, ${ }^{61}$ uṣtra-mukha 'camel face' from uṣtra-mukham iva mukham yasya 'whose face is like the face of a camel. ${ }^{62}$ While Kātyāyana saw here the ellipsis of the latter member of a lower level compound that existed before the final composition, later commentators ${ }^{63}$ start with a hypothetical compound *śākabhojipārthiva and assume the ellipsis of the middle member. ${ }^{64}$

In his vārttika 1 on II 3 19, Kātyāyana states that the case relation of a noun with the verb takes precedence over that with a nominal supplement to the verb: though namas 'homage' would require the dative of its object (namo devebhyah by Pānini II 3 16), we use the accusative in namaskaroti devān 'he reverences the gods'-the construction of $\sqrt{k r}$ 'do' with accusative prevails over the construction of namas with dative. In the vārttika-s 1 and 2 on II 328 Kātyāyana assumes ellipsis of a gerund: in prāsādāt prekṣate 'he looks down from the terrace,' he takes 'terrace' as the object of a lost gerund in a hypos-

tasized sentence *prāsādam āruhya prekṣate 'after climbing the terrace he looks' (the example is Patañjali's). Of grammatical interest is also Kātyāyana's definition of a sentence as 'having one verb' (eka-ti ${ }^{i}$; vārttika 10 on II 11 ); in nominal clauses the verb 'is/are' is supplied (vārttika 11 on II 3 1).

Kātyāyana ${ }^{65}$ first formulated for us the basic principles of grammatical analysis which allow us to isolate abstract units like roots, suffixes, etc. even though these never occur alone in ordinary language. By a two way reasoning of anvaya 'concurrent presence, agreement' and vyatireka 'concurrent absence, difference' we can isolate and coordinate word elements and their meanings. Patañjali explains what is meant: the word vrksas 'tree' suggests a certain physical object with roots, branches, fruit and leaves; the word vrksau 'two trees' suggests likewise roots, branches, etc., but in two specimens. We conclude that the constant meaning 'tree' is carried by the element vrksa-, the notions 'one' and 'two' by the sounds /s/ and /au/, respectively. An attempt to prove by the same method that the single sounds carry meaning is abandoned: sounds in themselves are meaningless (vārttika-s 9-15 on Śiva-sūtra 5). In his remarks on vārttika 15 Patañjali points out that otherwise the similarity of $k \bar{u} p a$ 'well,' sūpa 'sauce' and yūpa 'sacrificial post' would force us either to assume that the three words and the objects denoted by them have more common than separate properties or that their special meanings are totally expressed by their first sounds alone-which would leave a meaningless -ūpa. ${ }^{66}$

## FRAGMENTS PRESERVED IN THE MAHĀBHĀṢYA

While the first purpose of Patañjali's Mahābhāsya is a discusssion of Kātyāyana's vārttika-s, in the process of these discussions he frequently refers to other authors, quoting metrical lines (and a few prose sentences) from their works. ${ }^{1}$ The later commentators uniformly call these fragments sloka-värttika-s or merely vārttika-s; sometimes they ascribe these verses to Kātyāyana, author of the vārttika-s, other times they contrast the author of the sloka-vārttika-s with the author of the vārttika-s. The great variety of metres, ranging from sloka-s ( 165 verses) and $\bar{a} r y \bar{a}-\mathrm{s}$ (about 40 verses) to classical metres like vamśastha and dodhaka, suggests a number of authors. Kaiyata (11th c. A.D.) reports a tradition that the dodhaka stanza found in Mahābhāsya I 484, 17 f. was composed by Vyāghrabhūti, and the sloka in Mahābhāsya III 199, 19 is quoted by Patañjali as the tradition of the Bhāradvājīya-s. The other verses remain anonymous for us.

Some of the verses are devoted to the same kind of critical investigation as Kātyāyana's vārttika-s, and at times Patañjali's discussion is no more than a prose paraphrase of the verses with illustrations added (e.g. on Pānini I 1 19); the verses are often repeated without interruption after Patañjali's elaborations. In other instances they are quoted beside the prose vārttika-s of Kātyāyana; the stanza Mahābhāsya II 121, 7 f. even refers to Kātyāyana by name and quotes his vārttika on Pānini III 2118. ${ }^{2}$

Independent critique of the Aṣtādhyāyī seems to have been the objective of the prose annotations attributed to the Saunāga-s ('followers of Sunāga' ${ }^{1}$ ) who are quoted seven times in the Mahābhāsya for their remarks; once their statement is repeated without attribution, which shows that Patañjali, even where he seems to speak for himself, may actually quote earlier authors. ${ }^{3}$

Patañjali's short discussion of Pānini VIII 258 gives an idea of the rich grammatical activity in the centuries between the two authors. The IndoEuropean root $\sqrt{v u ̄}$ has differentiated in Sanskrit into several homonyms follow-

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ F. Kielhorn, IA 15.228-233. The metrical quotations are conveniently gathered at the end of vol. 2-5 of the Rohtak edition of the Mahābhāsya.
    ${ }^{2}$ There can be little doubt that bhagavān Kātyah 'the venerable Kātya' in the stanza Mahābhāsya II 97, 26f. refers to the same Kātyāyana. The reference to vārttika 3 on Pānini III 437 in the line quoted in Mahābhāsya II 176, 12 contains the earliest use of the word vārttika for Kātyāyana's annotations.
    ${ }^{3}$ Mahābhāsya II 209, 8 (anonymous) =II 105, 8 and 238, 11 (Saunāgāh).
ing different inflectional patterns; their part. perf. pass. are vit-ta, vin-na and vid-ita. Patañjali quotes three anonymous stanzas which were attempts to arrange this material. The first is a dodhaka (the first quarter is defective) which distinguishes four roots $\sqrt{v i d}$ : after the root $\sqrt{v i d}$ that follows the 6 th verbal class the suffix is retained, after $\sqrt{v u ̄}$ of the 7 th class $/ t /$ is optionally replaced by $/ \mathrm{n} /, \sqrt{v u ̄}$ of the 4 th class is treated like $\sqrt{c h i d}$ and that of the 2 nd class has an /i/ inserted between root and suffix. The peculiar feature in this stanza is that it gives the character of the 6th class as ${ }^{d} a^{k}$ while Pānini calls it ${ }^{d} a$; that seems to indicate that the reference is not to Pānini's grammar but to one very close to it. The second stanza is a śloka which repeats the statement in strictly Pāṇinian terminology and with greater concision. The third stanza, also a śloka, finally takes the popular approach of pairing finite verb forms with their part. perf. pass.: from vetti the p.p.p. is vidita, from vidyate vinna, from vintte both vitta and vinna, and from vindati vitta.

Even Kātyāyana's vārttika-s had become the object of interpretation and critique before Patañjali. The school of the Bhāradvājīya-s ('followers of Bhāradvāja') is quoted ten times for contributions on the vārttika-s. ${ }^{4}$ In most cases, the vārttika has been enlarged to cover additional items, and in a few instances there are alterations or even a different solution; once the remark is addressed directly to Pānini's rule. Other remarks on the vārttika-s are quoted anonymously. Vārttika 4 on Pānini III 2171 postulates the words sāsahi, vāvahi, cācali and pāpati; here Kātyāyana obviously has been caught napping ${ }^{5}$ because there is no need to list these as ready-made words as their analysis is so clear: the suffix $-i$ is used after the intensive of the roots $\sqrt{s a h}, \sqrt{v a h}, \sqrt{c a l}$ and $\sqrt{p a t .}{ }^{6}$

Occasionally the dispute involves the tradition of the vārttika-s themselves. In the very involved discussion on Pānini I 169 (vowels of the sound table denote also the other vowels of their respective classes, i.e. /a/ denotes also / $\bar{a} /$, etc.), Kātyāyana says that this is unnecessary because the 'form' of the vowel grasps the other vowels (vārttika 7) and because these are not different from each other (vārttika 8). With a slight variation in the text of vārttika 8, the other tradition quoted by Patañjali takes these two arguments as one: ". . . are not different because the 'form' is grasped" - an easier reading but hardly in Kātyāyana's style. ${ }^{7}$

In his discussion of why Pānini used two determinatives $k$ and $\dot{n}$ when the functions of the two are almost identical, Kātyāyana supports the existence of both with the reference to the root $\sqrt{j a ̄ g r}$ which shows the base vowel in some

forms (e.g. jāgrtaḥ) and guṇa in others (e.g. jāgaritah): jāgro 'guṇa-vidhīh "[The purpose is] establishing non-guṇa for $\sqrt{j} \bar{a} g r$. . The variant reading quoted by Patañjali, Mahābhāsya I 193, 1, states conversely jāgro guṇa-vidhīh "[The purpose is] establishing guṇa for $\sqrt{j a ̄ g r}$." Factually speaking, both readings amount to the same thing. One cannot even properly speak of two readings because, with the negation elided, both sound exactly the same. But it is my impression that the authors of sūtra-s have always avoided formulations where controversial negations would be completely obliterated by sandhi; had Kātyāyana indeed intended the negated form, he would have found a way to tell us so more clearly. ${ }^{8}$

In another class are the lines quoted in Mahābhāsya II 284, $1^{9}+14$ f.; 310, $9-311,6 ; 398,13$, which do not discuss Pānini's formulations but teach grammar. ${ }^{10}$ The dependence on Pānini is obvious ${ }^{11}$ but there are also characteristic differences. Pānini reduces several taddhita suffixes through the use of heterophones ( $T H=i k, C H=\bar{\imath} y$, etc.) which results in metalinguistic forms like $T H a^{k}$, $T H a^{n}, t T H a^{n}$, etc. Our metrical grammar makes no use of these heterophones and teaches the suffixes as $i k a^{k}, i k a^{n}, t i k a^{n}$, etc., otherwise retaining Pānini's determinatives. ${ }^{12}$

## PATAÑJALI

"Either read the Mahābhāṣya or rule a large kingdom" (Mahābhāṣyam vā pāthaniyam mahārā̄yam vā pālaniyam)—this saying among the pandits shows the high regard in which they hold Patañjali's work. Modern critics have joined them in their praise of Patañjali's simple yet vigorous style and his sound reasoning as well as his vast learning that presents us with the quintessence of generations of grammatical-philological research. ${ }^{1}$ For him, Sanskrit is still the spoken language of daily conversation, if only for some classes of 'good society,' and he handles it with evident authority-maybe the last grammarian to do so. Correct use of Sanskrit could no longer be defined geographically or sociologically in his time. That gave Patañjali an extra motive for studying Pānini's grammar: as a standard, a device to identify good native speakers of Sanskrit. ${ }^{1 a}$ Of the three sages of grammar, viz. Pānini, Kātyāyana and Patañjali, according to a common tradition (e.g. Kaiyata on Pānini I 1 29) the later author overrules the earlier one in case of a conflict of opinion, yet three Buddhist commentators attached greater value to the words of Pānini. ${ }^{2}$

In cross references to his own words, Patañjali calls his work simply bhāsya '[work composed] in colloquial language' and indeed it is stylized as a series of shorter or longer debates. A student may ask a question which is answered by the teacher or his younger assistant; often the answers of the assistant are not satisfactory and are set aside by the final opinion (siddhānta) of the teacher to whom both student and assistant turn for help. These labels 'student,' 'teaching assistant,'3 and 'teacher' which the later tradition supplies are useful in our understanding of these debates; they reflect the common school practice as observed by D. Ingalls. ${ }^{4}$ But we must keep in mind that they are superimposed on the bhäsya text (which has nothing of this kind), and that often the commen-

tators' very definite opinions as to which is Patañjali's final view are based only on their judgement of the merit of the arguments and not on a formal indication of Patañjali. ${ }^{5}$

Patañjali must have composed his work sometime around 150 B. C. because of several references to historical events of his time. ${ }^{6}$ Kātyāyana, vārttika 2 on III 2 111, had postulated the use of the imperfect suffixes for something the speaker did not witness though he could perhaps have done so and which is commonly known. Patañjali, Mbhās. II 119, 4f., illustrates this amendment with two sentences: aruṇad Yavanaḥ Sāketam "The Greek besieged Sāketa (=Ayodhyā/Oudh)" and aruṇad Yavano Madhyamikām "The Greek besieged Madhyamikā (Chittor)." This is a reference to the raids by the powerful Greek kings of Baktria (Afghanistan), though the exact year of these incidents remains unknown. The use of present tense suffixes for a work already begun but not completed is illustrated with the sentence iha Pusyamitram yāayāmah "Here we conduct a ritual for Puşyamitra" (Mbhās. II 123, 3f.). This Puşyamitra was the founder of the Suinga dynasty that replaced the Maurya-s in 189 B.C. It is reported that Puşamitra twice performed the horse sacrifice ritual (aśvamedha), ${ }^{7}$ and Patañjali's illustration should refer to one of these performances. It is not clear what value should be attached to the reference to Śaka-s in Northwest India outside Āryāvarta (Mbhāṣ. I 475, 4): when did Śaka-s first come into India? ${ }^{8}$

Patañjali's home may have been Mathurā, which figures prominently in his examples, or a place nearby because one travels, he says, to Pātaliputra via Sāketa (Mbhās. II 162, 6f.). ${ }^{9}$ The popular dialect forms which he quotes (Mbhās. I 259, 6-14) correspond, with their retention of $/ \bar{s} /$ and $/ \mathrm{s} /$ and the development $/ \mathrm{s} />/ \mathrm{s} /$, to the dialect of the gambler Māthura in the drama Mṛcchakaṭika (Act II). This deduction is preferable to that of K.V. Abhyankar ${ }^{10}$ who concluded from astronomical data contained in the text that Patañjali lived north of Taxila and west of Shrinagar. Not being an astronomer himself, Patañjali would have taken this information from other works, and his praise of the speech and the customs of the people in Āryāvarta would be inconsistent with his residence outside this hallowed province.

Later traditions (e.g. Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita's Patañjali-carita ${ }^{11}$ ) identify this Patañjali ${ }^{12}$ with the supposed author of the Yoga-sūtra and also ascribe to him a lost work on medicine. But the same name, admittedly rare, is not sufficient reason for this identification; we even hear of two more Patañjali-s in Sanskrit literature. The language of both works is quite different ${ }^{13}$ and the philosophical background of the Yoga-sūtra (a compilation which has probably more than one author anyway) shows no more similarities with that of the Mahābhāsya than can be expected in texts of this period. Modern scholars are divided on this question. ${ }^{14}$ Tradition regards Patañjali as an incarnation of the mythical snake Sesa and depicts him as a snake from the waist down. ${ }^{15}$

The concluding verses of the second book of Bhartṛhari's Vākyapadīya give us some idea of the vicissitudes the tradition of the Mahābhāsya had to undergo. After a period of sophistry, the oral tradition in South India was interrupted until it was revived by the Buddhist scholar Candragomin (5th c. A.D.?) who relied on the North Indian tradition (probably of Citrakūṭa/Rāmagiri). ${ }^{16}$ The text itself has come down to us in excellent condition. Its principal division into 8 chapters with 4 pāda-s each follows Pānini's grammar, whereas the division into 85 'daily lessons' (āhnika) of about equal length (never crossing pāda lines) is nowhere mentioned in the text itself and may be a later addition. According to the Chinese pilgrim I-tsing, advanced scholars learned the Mahābhāsya in three years. ${ }^{17}$

The Mahābhāsya is, in the first instance, a commentary on Kātyāyana's vārttika-s. But Patañjali did not stop at this and investigated Pānini's formulations on his own. Altogether his investigation covers 1713 sūtra-s of Pānini not counting those mentioned incidentally in the course of these investigations. A complete explanation consists of a separation of the words, example, counterexample and supplementation of the sentence (Mbhās. I 11, 22 f.). But such an explanation of the vārttika-s (e.g. Mbhās. I 30, 2-6) is often only the beginning of Patañjali's own investigation. This may take the form of a simple addition as in his comment on Pānini III 3130 (according to Pānini's rule, the suffix

-ana found after certain roots with isad, dus or su "is found also after others"). A vārttika specifies: the suffix -ana is added to the roots $\sqrt{s a ̄ s}, \sqrt{y u d h}, \sqrt{d r s}$ and $\sqrt{d h r s}$, in colloquial language only. Patañjali spells out the resulting words: Duhsāsana, Duryodhana, durdarśana, durdharṣana. Then he adds: "'Also after the root $\sqrt{m r s}$ ' must be added [to this list to account for the word]: durmarṣana" (Mbhās. II 157, 9-12).
The following discussion goes much deeper. Pānini III 167 teaches the suffix -ya to denote the object or the existence of the action (personal and impersonal passive in our terminology). Patañjali asks why the dual or plural forms may only be used when the verb denotes objects (e.g. pacyante odanäh 'rice paps are being cooked') but not when it denotes the existence of the action (āsyate bhavatā/bhavadbhyām 'sitting is being done by thou/you two'). The answer is that the objects may be many but the action is only one; if action nouns like $p \bar{a} k a$ 'cooking' appear occasionally in the dual or plural (päkau 'two acts of cooking') this is due to different material substrata. Thus the problem remains, viz., that the same logic should apply to actions expressed by passive verbs, and Patañjali tries another approach. When we consider different acts of cooking, he says, e.g. the cooking of rice pap, the cooking of molasses and the cooking of sesame, the three words 'cooking' are the same and can be summed up in a plural noun form; ${ }^{18}$ the same occurs (but only rarely) with verb forms (e.g. hataśāyikāh śayyante "The slain men lie in different postures," lit. 'lyings of the slain take place'). If we however consider time differences, the nouns (e.g. 'yesterday's cooking,' 'today's cooking') each are still identical and can be contracted into a single dual or plural form, while the verb forms (lies, lay, will lie) are different and hence not eligible for comprehensive plural forms. Patañjali concludes this argument by listing the differences between an action expressed by a nominal suffix and that expressed by a verbal suffix. The former becomes like a thing which means that another action can inhere in it or (grammatically speaking) that the noun can be construed with a verb ('cooking happens'); it also can be a factor in another action ('rice is prepared by cooking'). The opposite is true for an action expressed by a verbal suffix: no action can inhere in another action. Furthermore, an action expressed by a verb shows time, person and voice, and it calls for an expression of the agent; not so an action expressed by a nominal suffix. The use of gender and number is at least partially different.

Now Patañjali turns his attention to Kātyāyana's first vārttika. Shall we assume that in a verb existence, object and agent of an action are expressed by the personal endings or by the stem-forming suffixes ${ }^{19}$ Pānini's rules could be taken either way. If the personal endings are taught to express existence,

    ${ }^{19}$ E.g. in bhav-a-ti 'becomes' $-a$ - is the stem-forming suffix, $-t i$ the personal ending.
object, etc. it is feared that the rule may no more be a restriction on the use of singular, dual and plural forms (vārttika 1). But if the stem-forming suffixes should express these notions it is feared that these suffixes may in some cases not even come into existence because their role has already been pre-empted by a nominal suffix (e.g. dhāraya 'holding' formed from a causative stem with a suffix $-a$ denoting the agent; vārttika 2 ). ${ }^{20}$ Besides, several verb forms have no stem-forming suffix at all (e.g. in the perfect tense) or lose it in the grammatical process (e.g. the verbs of the 2 nd class). Patañjali concludes that it is the personal endings that denote existence/object/agent of the action and he settles the objection raised in the first vārttika with a quoted stanza: just as the nominal case suffixes denote both action references (such as object, instrument, etc.) and number, a single rule can teach the personal endings to denote existence/object/agent of the action and at the same time impose a restriction on the use of singular, dual and plural forms. ${ }^{21}$

With great stylistic art Patañjali has created the impression of a freely progressing debate with new disputants butting in now and then in which all possibilities of an interpretation are scrutinized. Clearly not every argument made (a few were omitted in the preceding summary) carries Patañjali's conviction; even the end of a debate may not necessarily indicate his preference. ${ }^{22}$ The metarule nirdisyamānasyādes $\bar{a}$ bhavanti ${ }^{23}$ says that substitutes can only be applied to forms that are actually enounced in a rule, and Patañjali makes frequent use of it (e.g. Mbhās. I 29, 23; 116, 19; III 50, 18). And yet he has refuted it in two detailed discussions (on Pānini I 149 and VI 4 130) because it would render Pānini's own given metarule I 149 saṣthi sthāne-yog $\bar{a}$ "The genitive is to be construed with a supplied 'in place of . . ." redundant.

Patañjali's statements reflect a further development of the Sanskrit language. To give but one example, singular dvandva compounds which were formerly limited to types like pāni-pädam 'hand and foot' can now be formed from any kind of constituents (Mbhās. I 232, 4f.). ${ }^{24}$ The exemplary speech area is no longer the North but Āryāvarta, the 'hub of the Ārya-s,' i.e. the central portion of the North Indian plain. The Ārya-s are contrasted with the residents of Afghanistan (Kamboja; cf. Nirukta II 2) and such Indian provinces as Surāṣtra and the prācya-madhya 'eastern central' (Mbhās. I 9, 25-27). The colloquial Eastern forms with $/ \mathrm{r} />/ 1 /$ (he 'layaḥ for correct he 'rayah 'hey strangers!') are

'barbarian' (mleccha; Mbhās. I 2, 8). Even in the exemplary area, good speech ${ }^{25}$ is not universal; a Brahmin's wife or daughter may use colloquial popular forms (Ltaka for correct Rtaka, Mbhās. I 19, 21 f.). Only the virtuous educated Brahmins of Āryāvarta are authoritative native speakers of Sanskrit and the study of Pānini's grammar makes it possible to identify such men (Mbhās. III 174, 6-15). The superiority of the educated native speaker over a mechanical studied grammarian is illustrated by an anecdote told by Patañjali, Mbhās. I 488, 18-22:
"For thus spoke some grammarian: 'Who is the urger-on (pravetr) of this chariot?' The charioteer-cum-bard (sūta) ${ }^{26}$ said: 'Sir, I am the driver (prājitr).' The grammarian said: 'Wrong word!' The charioteer said: 'Your Excellency ${ }^{27}$ knows [only] what should result [from a mechanical application of the rules of grammar] but not what is desired [by good speech usage]: such-and-such a form is desired.' The grammarian said: 'Hey, are we obstructed by this ill-woven (dur-uta) one?' The charioteer said: 'sūta is not formed from the root $v e^{a}$ ('weave:' su +uta $>$ sūta 'well woven') but from the root $s \bar{u}$ ('drive'). [Therefore:] If one wants to scold the driving one must say: duhsūta 'bad sūta'."
With Patañjali the interpretation of Pānini's rules reaches a new level of sophistication. ${ }^{28}$ Often he can maintain Pānini's formulation where Kātyāyana had to resort to alterations, and much more than Kātyāyana he has us rely on our knowledge of the Sanskrit forms when we must choose between alternative interpretations of grammatical rules. ${ }^{29}$ His basic assumption is that "it is impossible that [in Pānini's work] even a [single] sound should be without [specific] purpose"; for Pānini (no ordinary teacher but an authority) took great pains with his composition (Mbhās. I 39, 10-12; cf. the quoted verse III 54, 4). Though Patañjali never calls Pānini a rṣi 'seer' as the later tradition does, even according to him Pānini 'saw' the grammatical relations (e.g. Mbhās. I 43, 9). The same is said about Kātyāyana when Patañjali explains why this author composed two separate vārttika-s 9 and 10 on Pānini VIII 26 when he could have achieved his purpose with a single vārttika:
"First the teacher saw this: . . [vārttika 9] . . ; that was recited. At a later time this was seen: . . [vārttika 10] . . ; that was also recited. And teachers do not in such cases retract rules after they have given them" (Mbhās. III 393, 1-3).

The authoritative teacher can no more retract his 'true vision' than Durvāsas his curse. From this authoritative character of Pānini's and Kātyāyana's work follows the first rule of interpretation (and indirectly all others):
"The specific sense [of an expression in a śāstra] is obtained from interpretation; for there cannot be [assumed to be given a definition which is a] non-definition [just] because there is a doubt [as to its specific sense]" (Mbhās. I 35, 16f.).
Patañjali's interpretation rules are either applications of a generally accepted principle or they are technical explications indicated and necessitated by the wording of Pānini's rules. But even general principles and Pānini's own indications are subject to critical discussion. It seems that according to Kātyāyana a special rule supersedes a general rule only when there is no possibility of both taking effect together, but according to Patañjali a special rule sets aside the general rule in all cases by the popular maxim:
"When it is said: 'Let curds be given to Brahmins, buttermilk to [the Brahmin] Kaundinya'; Kaundinya is given only buttermilk although it would be possible to give him both" (Mbhās. I 115, 1-4). ${ }^{30}$
Attempts to see in the wording of Pānini's rules 'indications' for further interpretation rules were even more open to challenge. Many are only forced manoeuvres to maintain Pānini's formulation in the face of proposed changes. The metarule that intra-stem (antar-anga) operations prevail over such as are dictated by outside (bahir-anga) forces is both linguistically sound ${ }^{31}$ and indicated by Pānini's procedure. But a difficulty arises in the formation of the gerund where the root substitution $d h \bar{a}>h i$ (in hitv $\bar{a}$ 'having put') is voided when the suffix -tv $\bar{a}$ is replaced by - ya due to an outside force (viz. the prefix): pra-dhāya. Pānini's silence on this point could be an oversight (which is unacceptable to Patañjali) or it could imply that in his opinion the antaranga metarule is set aside when a gerund substitution $t v \bar{a}>y a$ is concerned. Patañjali sees proof for the correctness of the latter assumption in the formulation of Pānini II 436 where the root substitution $a d>j a g d h^{32}$ is taught before both gerund suffixes (hence jagdhvā and prajagdhy $a$ ): if the gerund substitution would not normally set aside the antaranga root substitution it would have been unnecessary to expressly mention - ya here, but if it does its mentioning becomes necessary.

Discussions of this kind constitute a major portion of the Mahābhāsya. A sound principle of interpretation, the presumption that the author's words should make sense, is vitiated often by a belief in the near infallibility of this author (if we take an historic view) or a preference for ad hoc created metarules ${ }^{33}$ over amendments to the basic text (if we take the more appropriate syste-

Pānini has suffered more at his hands than at those of the Vārttikakāra." ${ }^{34}$ Several of Pānini's own metarules are declared redundant (e.g. Pānini I 156 "A substitute is like the original . . ."; Mbhās. I 133, 17-134, 9) because they are nothing but applications of universal principles. But twice (Mbhās. I 14, 7 and 39, 8) Patañjali declines to revamp the whole system of metalinguistic markers (determinatives) with the words: sidhyaty evam a-Pāniniyam tu bhavati "It works this way but it becomes un-Pāṇinian."

Another prominent portion of the discussions deals with the dittoing process inherent in the sūtra-style. When an expression is dittoed through a string of consecutive rules, a problem arises in case its absence in one of the intervening rules is essential. All remedies suffer from the arbitrariness involved: the dittoed expression may 'leapfrog' or the whole rule in which it is enunciated may be dittoed to serve as a neutralizing vehicle. I shall illustrate both procedures with the proposed emendation of Pānini I $13 i^{k} .0$ guṇa-vṛddhi which Patañjali proposes to reduce to $i^{k} . a h$ (Mbhās. I 44, 3-8):

| I 11 | vṛddhir $\bar{a}^{d} a i^{c}$ | vṛddhir $\bar{a}^{d} a i^{c}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $2 a^{d} e^{\bar{n}}$ guṇah (vrddhir leapfrogs) | $a^{d} e^{n}$ guṇah [vrddhir $\bar{a}^{d} a i^{c}$ ] |  |
| 3 $i^{k} . a h$ [guṇah] [vrddhir] | $i^{k} . a h$ [guṇah] [vrddhir] |  |

In his discussions Patañjali shows an unusual resourcefulness ${ }^{35}$ and displays his familiarity with the methods and doctrines of the Mīmāṃsā, Sāmkhya and early Nyāya-Vaiśesika. ${ }^{36}$ There are also frequent references to law and custom. Illustrations and sample sentences are carefully chosen and represent characteristic situations. He demonstrates the transformation of cases in a sequence of sentences:

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{34}$ F. Kielhorn, Kātyāyana and Patañjali, p. 52.
    ${ }^{35}$ Sometimes a less sympathetic reviewer is tempted to speak of 'tricks,' e.g. when Patañjali proposes to interpret Pānini I $15 k-\bar{n}-i t . i c a$ as ${ }^{*} k-k-n ̣-i t . i c a$ standing for ${ }^{*} g-k-n ̣-i t . i c a$ to meet a technical difficulty (Mbhās. I 269, 10-12). Certainly that was not Pānini's intention; a more serious objection would be that the interpretation depends on information not contained in the Astāathyāyī.
    ${ }^{36}$ One should not ascribe to Patañjali the authorship of all or most of such doctrines; cf. P.V. Kane, History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. V (Poona, 1962), p. 1156-1158. The two types of negation (nominally bound and verbally bound) have recently attracted much attention: L. Renou, La Durghaṭavṛtti, introduction, p. 114f.; H. Scharfe, Die Logik, p. 63 f.; J.F. Staal, BSOAS 25. 58-61 and JAOS 83.255; G. Cardona, Lg. 43.34-56; B.K. Mattal, The navya-nyāya doctrine of negation (Cambridge, Mass., 1968), p. 156f. and Epistemology, logic, p. 163. For the peculiar reasoning 'the aorist marker $c_{i}{ }^{i}$ replaces ${ }^{c} L i$ if it does not replace ${ }^{c} L i$ ' see H. Scharfe, Die Logik, p. 85 f.
"The cattle, the horses, the gold are Devadatta's (genitive); the son of a widow (nominative) is rich. It is understood: Devadatta (nominative)" (Mbhās. I 264, 15f.).

The use of the rare word vaidhaveya 'son of a widow' is pointless if it should refer to any man who has lost his father, or an illegitimate child of his widowed mother (or the offspring by niyoga 'levirate') as it is hard to see why he should be typically rich. But if Patañjali refers to a man whom a widow has adopted, everything falls into place: "Indeed, especially in Western India it is notorious that when widows adopt, their most common motive is to take property out of the hands of their late husbands' relations. ${ }^{\prime 37}$ We learn from Patañjali's words that this custom was known already 2000 years ago. From similar casual references we can infer (to mention only two more items of interest ${ }^{38}$ ) that Patañjali knew the chess game ${ }^{39}$ and silk reeling. ${ }^{40}$ Regarding literature, many references point to the existence of kāvya-style poetry and the shadow play; ${ }^{41}$ Vedic quotations abound. ${ }^{42}$

Patañjali's grammatical terminology shows a marked return to Pāṇinian terms compared to Kātyāyana's more frequent use of non-Pāṇinian terms. ${ }^{43}$ In his explanation of vārttika 15 on Śivasūtra 5, Patañjali replaces Kātyāyana's apāya with lopa, his upajana with āgama and his vikāra with ādeśa (Mbhās. I 31, 14-18; cf. I 202, 21 f.). To account for the word bhīruka 'afraid' Patañjali teaches a new suffix with determinatives: ${ }^{k} r u k a^{n}$ (Mbhās. II 135, 14), in analogy to ${ }^{k} l u k a^{n}$ in Pānini III 2174.

Patañjali's contributions as a grammarian are both technical and philosophical. An example of his technical contribution is the discussion of the object in the sentence grāmaṃ gantum icchati "He wishes to go to the village" (Mbhās. II 15, 8-11). If both 'going' and 'village' are objects of 'wishing,' we cannot apply Pānini II 312 which allows for objects of 'going' alternatively the dative: grāmāya gantum icchati. If 'village' is the object of 'going' and 'going' in turn the object of 'wishing' we cannot properly construe the passive sentence isyate grāmo gantum "The village is the object of a desire to go there." The solution is that 'village' is the object of 'going' and both 'village' and 'going' are the objects of 'wishing.'

    ${ }^{43}$ We have to keep in mind that Patañjali incorporated in his work material from many sources which may explain some terminological inconsistencies.
When somebody, Patañjali says, told a weaver: "Weave a cloth from this yarn!" the weaver demurred facetiously: "If it is a cloth it need not be woven, and if it must be woven it is no cloth-the words 'cloth' and 'to be woven' are contradictory." Patañjali's solution to this problem is that the speaker intended a 'potential name' (bhāvinī samj $\bar{j} \bar{a} \bar{a}$ ), i. e. a name that will be realized at a later time: weave that which when woven will be called 'cloth!' (Mbhās. I 112, 10-13). Patañjali here wrongly limits the use of the word 'cloth' to a representation of an existing object and neglects its representation of a mental image. ${ }^{44}$ Unsatisfactory also is Patañjali's explanation for the use of the plural 'we' by a single speaker who sees himself as representing a class (Pāṇini I 259): "Sometimes one wants to express these sense organs as independent entities . . . In that case there will be [a] plural [form]" (Mbhās. I 230, 23-231, 2).45

Already Kātyāyana had stressed that the study of grammar is a sacred obligation; even correct speech usage is meritorious only if it is also theoretically understood. Patañjali supplies, apparently from traditional sources, two lists with special motivations for the study of grammar. The first (Mbhās. I 1 14) is short and abstract: protection of the Veda-s, adaption of formulas, traditional duty, convenient grasp of facts and removal of doubts. The second list (Mbhās. I 2, 3-6) contains 13 points built almost exclusively on quotations from Vedic texts and referred to by the first words of each quotation.

The benefits of such grammar study are said to be substantial. Patañjali insists that the list of sound abstracts at the beginning
"must be recognized as a mass of brahman, full of blossoms and fruit and adorned as long as there are the moon and the stars; and in their knowledge lies the attainment of the fruit of the merit [obtainable by the study] of all Veda-s, and his parents thrive in the heavenly world" (Mbhās. I 36, 16-18).

The 'blossoms' and 'fruits' (explained by Bhartṛhari in his Mahābhāṣya-dīpikā, p. 92, as visible prosperity and invisible beatitude) go all the way back to Rgveda X 71, 5 where, for certain people, Speech is said to be lacking in blossom and fruit (cf. also Nirukta I 20).

# Chapter IX 

## THE BUDDHIST SANSKRIT GRAMMARIANS

The need for a new grammar first arose among the Buddhists after some sects had adopted more prestigious Sanskrit versions of their canonical texts. While the Buddhists were familiar with most of the nouns in their vernacular garb, they lacked the Brahmins' command of the Sanskrit morphology and morphophonemics. They required a simple practical grammar for these topics; scientific interest in Sanskrit developed only later.

The first practical grammar we know of was the Kaumāralāta (so named after its author the littérateur Kumāralāta) of which manuscript fragments dating from about A.D. 325 have been found in Turkestan. ${ }^{1}$ Its terminology strives for brevity and shows the influence of writing (bindu 'drop' for the anusvāra, bindū 'two drops' for the visarga, reflecting the shape of the letters). Just as Pānini has special rules for Vedic forms, Kumāralāta makes allowances for peculiar forms of the Buddhist scriptures that resulted from their transposition into Sanskrit from Middle Indo-Aryan dialects (e.g. bhāveti for bhāvayati, bhesyati for bhavisyati and elisions of final -am/-im). The name used for these forms, $\bar{a} r s ̣ a$ 'belonging to the $r s ̣ i-s$, archaic,' suggests a reasonable timespan between the establishment of the Sanskrit canon and the composition of the Kaumāralāta.

Probably a recast of the Kaumāralāta is Sarvavarman's Kātantra 'Small Manual' (oldest manuscript fragments from Turkestan c. A.D. 400), ${ }^{2}$ also called Kaumāra or Kalāpa. ${ }^{3}$ It consisted originally of four books with four chapters each; ${ }^{4}$ but later the simple grammar was developed into a full-fledged system-the third and fourth books were merged and another author (variously identified as Kātyāyana, Vararuci or Śakaṭāyana) added a newfourth book (on primary noun suffixes). More additions, some of them inśloka form, were inserted into

    ${ }^{2}$ H. LüDERS, SPAW 1930.482-538=Ph. Ind., p. 659-721. Even these fragments already show insertions.
    ${ }^{3}$ According to the Tibetan tradition of Tāranātha, the author was a South Indian Brahmin called Saptavarman.
    ${ }^{4}$ The original text has been constituted and translated by B. Liebich, Zur Einführung in die indische einheimische Sprachwissenschaft, vol. I (Heidelberg, 1919).
the other books to cover secondary noun suffixes, composition and feminine suffixes. In this enlarged form (which by A. D. 800 had found its way into the Tibetan Tanjur) the Kātantra was the model for the topical arrangement of many later grammars. Much later additions are a Dhātu-pātha (modelled by Durgasimpha on that of Candragomin; another spurious Dhātu-pātha is found in Tibetan translation), ${ }^{5}$ a Lingānuśāsana and an Unādipāṭha, not to mention a large scholastic literature. In its terminology, the Kātantra often returns to Pāninian expressions but makes much less use of metalinguistic determinatives (most of them not even expressly defined) and there are no contractions. It lacks the generative tendency of Pānini's rules and appears more like a contrastive tabulation. The 180 verbal endings which Pānini derives from 18 base forms through substitution rules are here given in full (III 1 24-33). Sarvavarman was followed in this by the Pāli grammarians, and by Vopadeva and Anubhūtisvarūpācārya. Type-names like agni 'stems ending in -i/-u,' śraddhā 'feminine nouns ending in $-\bar{a}$, $d \bar{a}$ ' $\sqrt{\bar{d} \bar{a}}$ and $\sqrt{\bar{d} h \bar{a}}$ ' come close to a paradigmatic structure. ${ }^{6}$ The ablaut scheme is simpler if less correct: guṇa ar/e/o, vrddhi $\bar{a} r / a i / a u$ (IV 434 f .). ${ }^{7}$ The formulation of several rules shows the author's knowledge of the Mahābhāsya. ${ }^{8}$ The influence of the Prātisākhya-s is visible not only in the phonetic terms but also in the frequent notion of morphophonemic 'change' (expressed by the accusative); the lack of a fixed word order is curious: besides the dominant type $t \bar{a} n \bar{a}$ " $t \bar{a}$ becomes $n \bar{a}$ " (II 153 ) there is the type $\bar{a} n$ śas becomes $\bar{a} n$ " (II 39 ).

An old commentary probably by Sarvavarman himself (of which we still have reflexes in the fragments from Turkestan) was used by the Buddhist author Durgasimpha (between the sixth and eighth cent.) for his vrtti; this vrtti contains also vārttika-like annotations which try to expand the grasp of the sūtra-s by addition or interpretation. Durgasimpha is also the author of a subcommentary ( $t \bar{i} k \bar{a}$ ). The once very popular Kātantra has left its traces on many later grammatical systems (Kāccāyana's Pāli grammar, Hemacandra, et al.) but retained its popularity only in Kashmir, Nepal and parts of Bengal, with a large volume of secondary literature.

Not much different is the Kāsakrtsna Dhātu-pātha recently discovered together with a Canarese commentary; in fact the whole Kāsakrtsna grammar was just a version of the Kātantra (Palsule, Sanskrit Dhātupāṭhas, p. 44-49 and 17th AIOC, 1953, p. 349-355).

    ${ }^{8}$ P. Thieme, OLZ 35.239.
In a different class is the Cāndra-vyākaraṇa of the Buddhist litterature Candragomin who lived probably c. A. D. $450 .{ }^{9}$ The influence of the Mahābhāsya is evident in his work at every step. Candragomin's promise in his opening stanza to produce an easy, clear and complete grammar seems to contrast it with Pānini's complicated and Sarvavarman's eclectic creations; the format of eight books with four chapters each is meant to rival Pānini's work. The seventh book (on Vedic rules?) and the eighth (on accents ${ }^{10}$ ), however, are missing in our manuscripts even though an occasional rule survives as a quotation in the author's own vrtti. ${ }^{11}$ Evidently the Buddhists were less interested in these rules that had no application to Sanskrit as the Buddhists used it. ${ }^{12}$

Besides the sūtra-s (c. 3100 in the six surviving books) the grammar consists of a Vṛtti, a Dhātu-pātha with ten root classes, Unādi-sūtra-s (arranged alphabetically by the last sound), sikṣā-like Varna-sūtra-s (phonetic statements) and 86 Paribhāṣā-sūtra-s (metarules). ${ }^{13}$ The grammar was widely believed lost and its recovery towards the end of the 19th century is owed largely to the labours of B. Liebich. The manuscripts (almost exclusively from Nepal, a fragment from Kashmir) have remained precariously few for the constitution of a reliable text; ${ }^{14}$ Tibetan translations have been of some help. The main problem is the attribution of the vrtti to Candragomin himself, which seems indicated by the lack of any separate introduction or colophon (which merely refer to book and chapter of the Cāndra-vyākaraṇa), and by the use of the first person in nine cross-references to sūtra-s. On the other hand, K. C. Chatterji (in the notes to his edition) has drawn attention to five cross-references in the third person ${ }^{15}$ and other small inconsistencies: the vṛtti sometimes (e.g. on II 321 and V 3 18)

    ${ }^{11}$ A Vedic rule is quoted in Cv I 16 , accent rules in Cv I 345 and V 181 ; Candragomin's root list contains Vedic roots.
    ${ }^{12}$ The use of the old pitch accents was, however, not unknown in the oldest Buddhist traditions (S. LÉvi, JA XI ${ }^{\text {e }}$ serie, tome V. 401-447). The separate placement of Vedic and accent rules at the end of the grammar had its impact on later grammars: Vedic and accent rules are placed in two appendices in the Siddhānta Kaumudī, and Hemacandra and Kramadīśvara who had no use for them gave transfer rules for the derivation of the Prakrits instead.
    ${ }^{13}$ Of the once large secondary literature, we have remainders in Nepalese manuscripts and in Tibetan translations (B. Liebich, GGN 1895.317f., summarized in IA $25.103-105$ ).

refers to sūtra-s of Pānini rather than to Candragomin's parallel sūtra ${ }^{16}$ and derives words with unādi-suffixes (e.g. on V 19 ) which are not found in Candragomin's Unādi-sūtra-s. R. Birwe ${ }^{17}$ proposes that the author of the vrtti on the books I to IV should be Candragomin, of the vrtti on the books V and VI Dharmadāsa, whose name appears in a note at the end of the only complete manuscript in the hand of another scribe: "This is the work of the venerable teacher Dharmadāsa." This is not a likely solution. The note with Dharmadāsa's name has no separate bearing on the vrtti alone and Birwe's division of the vrtti (for the reason that all nine cross-references in the first person occur in the books I to IV, most of those in the third person in books V and VI) is arbitrary. One can as well point out that seven out of nine first person forms refer to the accent rules of book VIII, while only one out of five third person forms refers to the accent rules, but three to closely following rules-the difference may be due to stages in Candragomin's composition of the vrtti. Chatterji's assumption that the vrtti is not only written by another later author (Dharmadāsa) but is even later than the Kāśikā is hardly tenable. The Kāśikā on III 3175 argues against Candravrtti I 34 and it is unbelievable that the Candravrtti on I 3106 had to look for the Kāśikā on III 3131 to find the reason why Candragomin had no rule corresponding to Pānini III 3 131-138, especially when the Kāśikā teaches these rules and merely refers to the possibility that they could be omitted. The dependence of the Kāśikā on Candragomin's sūtra-s is a long established fact. ${ }^{18}$

Candragomin's grammar is the first great remake of Pānini's grammar (assuring us incidentally of the reliability of our Pānini text) and has had a lasting effect on the later Jain revisions of it. Its main claim to originality is staked out in the author's own words (Cv II 2 68) Candrôpajñam asamjñakam vyākaranam "The termless grammar is the work of Candra." To an astonishing degree he has succeeded in using only enumerations, contractions or descriptive expressions and in avoiding defined terms. Wherever Pānini would use the term wrddhi for vowels of the highest ablaut grade ( $\bar{a}[a r, a l] a i, a u$ ) Candragomin uses the contraction $\bar{a}^{d}-a i^{c}$ (e.g. V 1 83: augment plus initial root vowel $>$ vrddhi). While Pānini called a word with a vrddhi vowel in its first syllable vrddha (Pānini I 1 73), Candragomin's formulation remains descriptive: II 498 $\bar{a}^{d}-a i^{c}-a d y-a^{c} .0 \quad{ }^{e} y a^{a}$ "Suffix $-y a$ after [a word] which has $\{\bar{a} \ldots a i, a u\}$ as the first $\{a \ldots a u\}$ (i.e. vowel)." The most striking application of this principle is in the syntax of cases where Pānini's three levels (above, p. 94-96) have been reduced to two: objects and case forms. The expressions Candragomin uses

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ It is also curious that Candragomin, who replaced in several sūtra-s Pānini's samjñāyām 'when it is a term' with nämni 'when it is a name' (e.g. I 2 30; 3 77; II 2 14), paraphrases it in his vrtti with this same samjñāyām.

correspond either to Pāṇini's objective relations (ädhāra 'locus' or kriyāpya 'attainable by action,' i.e. object) or his semantic concepts (kartr 'agent,' sampradāna 'recipient')-all of them used descriptively. The semantic concepts whose introduction W.D. Whitney deplored ("the vastly more difficult and dangerous method" $)^{19}$ have disappeared between the two levels. ${ }^{20}$ Only the Pāli grammar of Moggallāna has followed Candragomin in this reduction. The case suffixes including their replacements are taught in II 1 1-42 followed by the rules on their syntactic use (II 1 43-98). There is no rule corresponding to Pānini's II 31 anabhihite "When [the semantic relation] is not already expressed [otherwise]" prefixed to the section. The generative strings which we have in Candragomin's substitution rules for nominal and verbal suffixes do not seem to extend to the more fundamental concepts.

Candragomin's material contributions to grammatical description are few: the wider use of the genitive case (II 195), the use of the negation $m \bar{a}$ with the imperative and future (I 34 : $m \bar{a}$ karotu 'he shall not do'; condemned by Kāśikā III 3 175), the alternative construction of $r t e$ 'without' with the accusative as well as the ablative (II 1 84), etc. Most of these additions have been subsequently introduced into the Pāṇinian system by the Kāśikā. On the formal side, Candragomin's formulations are often shorter than Pānini's. Of the three synonymous expressions $v \bar{a}$, vibhāsā, anyatarasyām used by Pānini, Candragomin only uses $v \bar{a}$ because it is the shortest. Often words are dropped or replaced by new, shorter expressions. Against Pānini's I 42 vipratisedhe param kāryam "When there is conflict, the subsequent[ly formulated] rule [takes precedence]," Candragomin dittoes parah from I 114 into I 116 vipratisedhe though here a neuter param is needed, and omits kāryam. The solution was not ideal but the idea caught on; the Jainendra-vyākaraṇa uses a shorter synonym: I 290 sparddhe param "When there is rivalry, the subsequent [prevails]" and Śākaṭāyana-vyākaraṇa I 146 sparddhe with parah dittoed from I 144.

Candragomin adheres to Pānini's metalanguage and develops it in some detail (e.g. a verbalizing zero suffix $V I^{p}$ I $127^{21}$ and a primary suffix ${ }^{k} s a$ as in $t \bar{a} d r k-s a$ I 2 51). This adherence is the reason for his peculiar remodelling of the sound table (merging 4 ha ya va rat and 5 las into one sūtra ha ya va ra las) which did not remove the double use of $n$ as an end marker ( $l a i u^{9}$ is the other occurrence). K.C. Chatterji wonders in his note on I 15 : "It is a thousand pities Candra did not remove the most glaring defect . . ." Such a switch of end markers however would have meant a change in the metalinguistic formulae while the elimination of the end marker $t$ amounts only to non-usage of an already unnecessary term (at occurs four times in the Aṣtādhyāyī but is not needed by Candragomin).

# Chapter X 

## THE JAIN SANSKRIT GRAMMARIANS

In time the Jains too adopted Sanskrit as a vehicle of thought and wrote grammars to suit their needs. Rules teaching purely Vedic forms and the old pitch accents were dropped, but neither the Jain grammarians nor any other Indian grammarians have replaced the latter with rules on the often-assumed stress accents in Sanskrit or other Indian languages. The reason for this omission is possibly that the stress accents, if they exist, are not strong. ${ }^{1}$

The oldest work is the Jainendra-vyākaraṇa of Devanandin called also Pūjyapāda. While some scholars place Devanandin before even Candragomin (5th cent. A.D.), others put him later than the authors of the Kāsikā (early 7th cent. A.D.). ${ }^{2}$ The grammar follows strictly Pānini's order of rules and retains their generative character. It seeks to make its contribution in the refinement of details, ${ }^{3}$ especially in the further economy of expression. From the word vibhakti 'case' Devanandin forms a variant $v-i$-bh-a-k-t-i to denote the seven cases by adding $\bar{a}$ to the consonants and $p$ to the vowels (I 2 158): $v \bar{a}=$ nom., $i p=$ acc., etc. ${ }^{4}$ The legion of invented short terms taxes the memory of the student. Devanandin follows the suggestion of Kātyāyana that the 'single remainder' process (above, p. 136) is not necessary to account for the dual and plural forms, and his commentators Abhayanandin ${ }^{5}$ and Somadeva ${ }^{6}$ refer to the work as the 'grammar without single remainder'-even though in Somadeva's recension the single remainder process has been reinstated. This would be an unhappy characterization if Devanandin lived after Candragomin who has also eliminated the single remainder process. Devanandin stays so close to Pānini's formulations that some additions proposed by Kātyāyana or Patañjali

In the ninth century A.D., a Jain monk, whose real name was perhaps Pālyakīrti, composed his Sākaṭāyana-vyākaraṇa (using the pen name Śākaṭāyana after the famed forerunner of Pānini) and a commentary on it named Amogha-vṛtti, after his patron the Rāṣṭrakūṭa king Amoghavarṣa I. He uses all preceding grammars, especially the southern recension of the Jainendravyākaraṇa, though without its excessive use of artificial terms. The topical arrangement of the rules reminds one of the Kātantra; the generative character is lost and the kāraka-s have a mere shadowy existence. The instruction on gender (in 69 āry $\bar{a}$ verses) is included in the commentary on I 21 , and the roots are (with the unexplained exception of those belonging to the first class) listed in the commentary to several sūtra-s of the fourth book where the sūtra refers to a certain root class.

The Jain polymath Hemacandra Sūri (1089-1172)? composed his Siddhahaimacandra at the request of his patron, the Cālukya king Jayasimpha-Siddharāja of Gujerat, to rival King Bhoja's Sarasvatī-kanṭhābharaṇa, mainly on the basis of the Śākaṭāyana-vyākaraṇa. ${ }^{8}$ Its c. 4500 sūtra-s are organized in eight books of four chapters each; but nearly a quarter of them belong to the eighth book dealing with the Prakrit dialects which are derived from Sanskrit by means of transfer rules. Hemacandra also wrote an extensive commentary on his work, the Bṛhadvṛtti (with a subcommentary, the Bṛhannyāsa, valuable for its identification of sources), and an abbreviated version of it, the Laghuvṛtti. The Bṛhadvṛtti includes not only the gaṇa-s but also the irregular formations ( $u^{\theta} \cdot \bar{a} d \dot{i}$ ), the gender rules (after sūtra I 129 , in verses) and a collection of metarules (called nyāya, at the end). In comparison to Bhoja's grammar where these lists are incorporated in the sūtra-s, Hemacandra's grammar is conservative. ${ }^{9}$ It eclipsed, due to its clear design, the grammars of Devanandin and Śākaṭāyana within the Jain communities and had, like these, its share of commentaries and recasts. But Pānini's grammar and the Mahābhāṣya were obviously well studied by all Jain grammarians ${ }^{10}$ and were never replaced as the classical authors on the subject.

# Chapter XI 

## THE LATER PĀNINI SCHOOL

The first author after Patañjali whose work we still have is Bhartṛhari (a disciple of Vasurāta, the adversary of Vasubandhu), who is now believed to have lived c. A.D. $450-510 .{ }^{1}$ The information of the Chinese pilgrim I-tsing that Bhartṛhari had died 40 years before his arrival in India (A.D. 671/672), i.e. in A.D. 631/632, must be wrong because Dignāga (c. A.D. 480-540) and other Buddhist authors of his time quote and use Bhartṛhari's Vākyapadīya. ${ }^{2}$ Besides this meagre biographical information there are numerous legends, most of them based on his supposed identity with the poet Bhartṛhari.

Bhartṛhari's commentary on the Mahābhāsya has survived in a single manuscript, incomplete and corrupt. ${ }^{3}$ The very beginning is missing and the fragment ends with the comment on Pānini I 155 though the work is known to have covered at least the first three pāda-s. ${ }^{4}$ The colophons call it either Bhartṛhari's Mahābhāsya-ṭikā ${ }^{5}$ or Bhartṛhari's Mahābhāsya-dīpikā; ${ }^{6}$ the parallel with the Trikāndī suggested further the name Tripādī 'The Three Chapters.' It is a very learned commentary that records Vedic usage and various opinions of other authorities.

Bhartṛhari's fame mainly rests on his Vākyapadīya 'Work Dealing with Sentences and Words,' the major part of which has survived precariously to this day. The first two books (kānda) with $138^{\circ}$ and 487 sloka-s, together with

    ${ }^{3}$ This commentary was still known to Nāgojībhatṭa and his disciple Pāyaguṇde (18th cent.) who both quote from it. Largely inspired by it is the Mahābhāsyapradīpa of the Kashmiri Kaiyaṭa (probably 11th cent. A.D., certainly before 1150: V. Raghavan, JOR 19.223).
    ${ }^{4}$ In the vṛtti on VP I 82, Bhartṛhari refers to his (?) commentary on the Mahābhāsya on Pānini I 4 109: that could suggest that he commented on more than the three $p \bar{a} d a-s$.

the author's own commentary (vrtti) ${ }^{9}$ are properly called Vākyapadiya; the third book called Prakīrnaka 'Miscellany' (with 1320 sloka-s in 14 sections; at least two more sections are known to be lost ${ }^{10}$ ) treats special points that were only outlined in the first two books. Together the three books could be called Trikāndi 'Three Books' but often the name Vākyapadiya was extended to cover the whole work. ${ }^{11}$

The relative chronology of these works (not to mention the lost Śabda-dhātusamikṣā) is not yet settled, except that the Mahābhāsya-dīpikā (ABORI ed., p. 46,1f.) quotes Vākyapadīya II 464. There are many correspondences in the formulations of these works, though the vrtti with its long, involved sentences (reasons and qualifications piled one upon the other, their attributes trailing) is especially hard to understand. ${ }^{12}$ The Dīpikā (p. 32, 24 vyäkarana. granthesu likhitāh 'written in the grammar books'; 33, 17 granthesu cālikhitstvāt) shares an interest in writing not otherwise found in Pāninīya works with VP I 20 (yatra vāco nimittāni cihnānivāksara-smrteh 'that in which the manifestors of speech like the signs of the alphabet appear . . .') and the vrtti on I 23 (aksara-nimittäksara-kalpanāvat 'as the letters of the script are thought of as the phonemes of the alphabet . . .').
The Kashmiri Helārāja (10th cent. A.D.) wrote separate commentaries on the verses of all three books of the Vākyapadīya (called Śabda-prabhā, *Vākyapradīpa? and Prakīrnaka-prakāśa) of which the first is lost and the second wrongly attributed to Punyarāja ${ }^{13}$ in most manuscripts; ${ }^{14}$ two gaps in the Prakīrnaka-prakāśa (III 7 34-49 and 65-69) have been filled with the comments of one Phullarāja. Vṛsabhadeva (date unknown) further wrote a gloss (paddhati) on the first kānda, including the vṛtti.

Bhartṛhari asserts the value of traditional interpretation and criticizes (VP II 481) Baiji, Saubhava and Haryakṣa for following 'dry reason' (śuska-tarka ${ }^{15}$ ), i.e. following factual observations of their own rather than the intimations in

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ The vrtti is an integral part of the work. Several times a sentence combines portions of the commentary and a verse (e.g. I $65 ; 90$ ). Often the verses are formulated so that the vrtti can fill them with alternate interpretations to suit linguists of different persuasions (A. Aklujkar, WZKSA 16.181-198; esp. p. 186). Only the vrtti has clear references to the illusionist concept of evolution which led M. BiarDeau to contest Bhartṛhari's authorship of it [Bhartṛhari-Vākyapadīya-Brahmakānda avec la Vṛtti de Harivṛṣabha (Paris, 1964), p. 5-21].

works like the Mahābhāsya. Agreeing with Patañjali (Mbhās. I 1, 19), Bhartṛhari (VP I 11) regards grammar as the most important vedāinga; for him, though, its value is not so much in its leading the adept to prosperity and to heaven (through conscious correct usage ${ }^{16}$ ) as in its revelation of brahman (through meditation exercises centered on language: väg-yoga or śabda-pūrvayoga). ${ }^{17}$ Speech is brahman. This central role of speech goes back to early Vedic tradition and was stressed again in tantric systems with which Bhartṛhari shares a few key terms (śakti, sädhana); it is not surprising that Abhinavagupta of the Kashmirian tantric school pays tribute to Bhartṛhari's work. ${ }^{18}$ Speech and meaning coexist in an undifferentiated state, from which the diversity of objects unfolds due to ignorance (avidy $\bar{a}$ ) through a wrongful attribution of differentiation by time and space. To convey such objects, comprehensive language signs develop, existent only in the mind and without inner sequence. To denote them, the ancient word sphota 'burst' is pressed into service, which in Mbhās. I 181, 21 denoted the permanent aspect of a phoneme. ${ }^{19}$ On the phonetic level, a sphota is then manifested by sequential sounds (dhvani), forming a sentence. ${ }^{20}$ From this sentence the listener realizes the sphota within himself and understands the communication. For the grammarian to analyse the communication or the sentences, it becomes necessary to superimpose formal categories like words, morphemes and phonemes/sounds which he would even impute to the sphota; thus we can speak secondarily not only of a sentencesphota but also of a word-sphota, sound-sphota, etc.

Already Kātyāyana recognized the importance of the 'desire to express' (vivakṣa) in language, but only Bhartṛhari has given it a philosophical foundation. Besides 'primary Being' (mukhyā sattā VP III 3 46), he recognizes 'metonymic Being' (aupacārikī sattā VP III 3 39), which is the meaning of words and exists in the mind. This new concept offers a better solution to an old problem: how can we say "Weave a cloth!" using the word 'cloth' for a thing that does not yet exist (if it already existed there would be no need to make it)? Patañjali

    ${ }^{17}$ K.A. Subramania Iyer, ALB 28.112-131. In the Dīpikā, p. 33,24-34,1, Bhartṛhari argues that, due to the permanent connection of word and object, words like apürva 'fate' let us infer the existence of their invisible objects. That may, however, not be his own conviction, for in VP III 3, 39-51 he recognizes that the object of a word is a mental image, not an external object.

    ${ }^{19}$ Pānini VI 1123 mentions a grammarian called Sphotāyana; any connection with the later sphota theory is speculative. On Audumbarāyana's theory, cf. above, p. 86 .
    ${ }^{20}$ In VP $1134 / 142$ we hear of three levels of speech ( $v \bar{a} c$ ) which are given as pasyantī ('seeing:' undifferentiated), madhyamā ('middle:' sequential and mental) and vaikharī ('elaborated:' spoken language).
answered that 'cloth' is a 'potential term' (bhāvini samjj $\bar{a}$ ) denoting that which will be called a cloth once it is completed (Mbhās. I 112, 9-13; above, p. 161). Bhartṛhari's concept of meaning as a mental image covers not only such instances of creation but also negated and absurd notions: the existence of a meaning does not imply reference to an external object.
Pānini's system of kāraka-s receives by the same device a proper philosophical underpinning. The naive impression that the kāraka-s are relations, that karman 'object' or karana 'instrument' are things participating in an action, must give way to the insight that we deal on the semantic level not with things but only with the inherent powers of things to contribute to the action and that the mind exercises a great deal of freedom in the selection of the powers it wishes to express (VP III 7, 1-3). The simple fact that Devadatta cooks rice in a pot is most commonly visualized with Devadatta as the agent and the pot as the location (Devadattah sthālyām odanam pacati); if however the speaker wants to stress that due to the quality of the pot the rice cooks quicker he may denote the pot as the agent (sthāli pacati "The pot cooks"). Similarly the firewood (normally seen as an instrument) or the rice itself may be visualized as the agent, but usually not a 'recipient' (sampradāna) or a 'take-off' (apādāna), i.e. there is no way to visualize Rāma in Rāmāya dadāti ("He gives to Rāma") or vṛkṣa in vṛkṣāt patati ("He falls from the tree") as an agent. Rāmo dadāti "Rāma gives" or vṛkṣah patati "The tree falls" would describe totally different events. ${ }^{21}$ Such changes of concept and expression are possible because each kāraka is an agent of its own contribution to the main action and assumes the role of instrument, etc. only in relation to the main agent (VP III 7, 20-23). Following the lead of Patañjali, ${ }^{22}$ Bhartṛhari differentiates various services (upakāra) of the kāraka-s, e.g. three major and four minor ones for karman 'object' (III 7, 45) because 'object' may be the product (mrdā ghaṭam karoti "He makes a jar with clay") or a modification (mrdam ghaṭam karoti "He makes the clay into a jar') or destination (nagaram upasarpatit "He goes to the city"). The four minor classes extend the object notion from 'that most desired by the agent' to unintended things ('walking to the city he touches grass'), disliked things ('he eats poison'), the residuals of Pānini I 451 (the double acc. with verbs meaning 'ask,' etc.) and those cases where an added preposition demands the replacement of another kāraka-and-case( $\sqrt{\text { krudh }}$ with dative, but abhi $\sqrt{\text { krudh }}$ with accusative). This line of research must have been continued by later authors because the Tamil grammar Vīracōjiyam refers to an elaborate system of upakāraka-s within the range of the kāraka-s (below, p. 182).

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ VP III 718 with Helārāja's commentary. Already Kātyāyana stated in his vārttika-s 7 through 14 on Pānini I 423 that 'instrument' (karaña) and 'location' (adhikarana) can be visualized as 'agent' (kartr), but 'take-off' (apādāna), etc. can not.
    ${ }^{22}$ Mbhās. III 51, 8f. "Location is of three kinds: pervasive, touching, topical." The formulation suggests that Patañjali quotes another source [H. Scharfe, Die Logik im Mahābhāṣya (Berlin, 1961), p. 76].
The study of Bhartṛhari's thought is still in its infancy; critical editions and usable translations come forth only slowly. But the study should be well worth the while of the linguist.

Though Pānini's sūtra-s must have been accompanied by oral instruction that turned the sūtra-s into understandable sentences and supplied the student with sets of examples, no such old vṛtti hassurvived. The Kāśikā-vṛtti of Jayāditya and Vāmana (early 7 th cent. A.D.), ${ }^{23}$ in spite of its title 'Vṛtti from Benares,' wants to be more: a compendium of Pāṇinian grammar. Its pedagogical approach has made it one of the most popular grammatical works, but its simplicity is often deceptive ${ }^{24}$ and the full meaning of its remarks becomes apparent only against the background of earlier discussions, notably in the Mahābhāsya. The commentary follows a sūtra text that often adopts the alterations proposed in the Mahābhāsya. ${ }^{25}$ The Buddhist Jinendrabuddhi (8th or 9th cent. A.D.) wrote the voluminous commentary Kāśikā-vivaraṇa-pañjikā alias Nyāsa on it in which he demonstrates an interpretation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī that makes Kātyāyana's vārttika-s redundant; Haradatta's Padamañjarī (13th cent. A.D.?) summarizes the Kāśikā philology of his time. The Bhāṣā-vṛtti of the Buddhist Puruṣottama (early 12th cent. A.D.) further simplifies the presentation of Pāṇinian grammar and omits the rules concerning Vedic language.

Whereas the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a scientific analysis for the benefit of native Sanskrit speakers, classroom needs called for a more practical introduction into Sanskrit. It is hardly an accident that the first such work within the framework of the Pāniniya tradition was produced by a Buddhist author from Ceylon: Dharmakīrti's Rūpâvatāra (10th cent. A.D.?) teaches Sanskrit in the form of a catechism arranged by grammatical topics similar to the Kātantra and often illustrated by paradigms. Other such rearrangements of Pānini's sūtra-s are the Rūpa-mālā of Vimala-sarasvati (14th cent. A.D.), Prakriyā-kaumudī of Rāmacandra (14th or 15th cent. A.D.), Prakriyā-sarvasva of Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa (A.D. $1616)^{26}$ and the Siddhānta-kaumudī of Bhatṭojī-dīkṣita (early 17th cent. A.D.). The last work especially has become the basis of several commentaries (two by the author himself: the Bāla-manoramā for students and the Praụdha-manoramā for scholars) and has all but replaced Pānini's work and the Mahābhāsya

for many students of Pāṇiniya Sanskrit grammar. The curious fact is that these sūtra-s, being identical with those of the Aṣṭādhyāyī except for their sequence, depend on a knowledge of Pānini's original work for their interpretation (e.g. the dittoing of words from a previous rule which the author supplies in his paraphrases). ${ }^{27}$ The arrangement (developed by Sarvavarman, Dharmakīrti and Rāmacandra) proceeds from vowel and consonant sandhi to the inflection of masculine noun stems ending in vowels, etc., various compounds, secondary noun formation, verb inflection and primary noun formation. ${ }^{28}$ It deserves to be studied from a linguistic point of view in contrast with the previous rearrangements and with Pānini's generative strings. Because so much in grammar is formal, it is not a meaningful critique of these works to say that "they differ only in the arrangement of the material."

It is not possible here even to mention the many authors that contributed through commentaries or monographs to the later Pāniniya tradition; many of their works still exist only in manuscripts. They are all put in the shade by the Mahratta Brahmin Nāgeśa or Nāgojībhatṭa Kāle ${ }^{29}$ (died in 1755 in Benares), whose prolific writings cover not only grammar but also dharma, poetics and yoga. His Mahābhāṣya-pradīpoddyota is a subcommentary on Kaiyaṭa's commentary on the Mahābhāṣya; his Bṛhacchabdenduśekhara, a subcommentary on Bhatṭoji-diksista's Praudhamanoramā. An independent work is his Vaiyā-karaṇa-siddhānta-mañjūsā (in three recensions of different length), a work of great depth in which he carries on the work of Bhartṛhari and the tantric philosophers. ${ }^{30}$ One of his last works may have been the Paribhāṣenduśekhara 'Moon crest of metarules' in which he critically examines previous attempts to gather all metarules applicable to Pānini's grammar. He condemns the search for even more metarules beyond those recognized in the Mahābhāṣya and advocates strong reliance on Patañjali as the latest authoritative source.

To mention only one point, action ( $k r i y \bar{a}$ ) is thought to consist of operation (vyāpāra) and fruit (phala) of which the former resides in the agent, the latter in the object; if both coincide we have an intransitive verb [K. Madhaya Krishna Sarma, Pānini Kātyāyana and Patañjali (Delhi, 1968), p. 160-164]. The contributions to linguistics contained in the works of the Mimāṃsā and of poetics cannot, in this limited survey, receive the attention they deserve.
# Chapter XII 

## THE ŠIKṢĀ-S

The many works regarded as Šikṣā-s ${ }^{1}$ cover a wide spectrum of Vedic studies. The dating of most of these texts is next to impossible; while some Šiksā-s, e.g., the Nārada-šiksā or the Āpiśali-šiksā, may go back to the 5th century A.D., if not further, ${ }^{2}$ others are much younger and must be assigned to the 11th to 15th centuries. ${ }^{3}$ In spite of names like Āpiśali-šikṣā or Pāninīya-šikṣā, none of them preserve the doctrines of the pre-Pāṇinian or Pāṇinian era. In the Pāninīyaśikṣā both / $\mathrm{r} /$ and / $\mathrm{r} /$ are called retroflex sounds; but according to the Prātiśākhya-s /r/ was pronounced at the root of the tongue and /r/ at the roots of the upper teeth. We would be mistaken if we accepted this Sikṣā as a witness for original Vedic pronunciation; it can only reflect the late tradition of a medieval school. The real thrust of the Sikṣā-s is more elementary; it is revealed for example by a little treatise called Svara-vyañjana-śikṣā which has only one purpose: to teach the student when he should regard an $r$ sound found in a text as a vowel and when as a consonant. To understand the problem one has to remember that the vocalic / $/$ / of Sanskrit did not survive as such in the successor languages, and its pronunciation in academic Sanskrit was more like /ri/: Rig-Veda, Samskrit, etc. It thus became indiscernible from original /ri/ sounds: rišādas, ripu, prātarindram (i.e. prātar Indram), and special rules became necessary to guide the student in his pronunciation and spelling. ${ }^{4}$ This concern with orthography is also clear in a quotation found in the Gautami-śikṣā which deals with the common doubling in consonant clusters: the Sikṣā quotes from another text the form yuññkssesva ${ }^{5}$ (instead of the normal yuñkṣva). The form looks bizarre until we consider the aksara $k s$ as a graphic unit-the proper transcription would be yuññkksssva.

Almost all Sikṣā-s are attached to a certain Veda; the Taittirīya school of the Black Yajurveda was the most prolific. It is noticeable that a great percentage of these manuals are products of South India; the Pāri-śikṣā by Cakra is even dedicated to the memory of Chief Pāri, praised in the Old Tamil literature.

When Vyāsa-śikṣā 317 defines the duration of one measure (i.e. the duration of a short vowel) by comparing it with the 'snapping of the fingers' (angulisphotana), it is influenced by the Tamil grammarians (Tolkāppiyam I 7, Nannūl 100: noti). The Vyāsa-śikṣā (13th cent. A.D.) develops the phonetic observations contained in the Prātisākhya of its school, i. e. the Taittirīya-Prātisśākhya, especially the aspects of quantity. The duration of the nasal sounds in various contexts is stated minutely-not to speak of the different pauses in a hiatus, after a sentence, a verse or a half-verse, at the end of a section or a chapter. On the other hand, numerous sandhi rules raise it almost to the rank of a Prātisākhya. A curious feature of this and many other Śikṣā-s is the symbolic value attributed to sounds that somehow connects sounds with castes and certain tutelary deities. The Māndavī-śikṣā of the White Yajurveda probably originated in Central or Northeastern India, where the distinction of $/ \mathrm{b} /$ and $/ \mathrm{v} /$ was lost, for it consists of an enumeration of the 641 words in the Yajurveda with 'true' /b/ sound; similarly, the Amoghānandinī-śikṣā gives a list of words with the initial $/ \mathrm{b} /$ and another with the initial $/ \mathrm{v} / .{ }^{6}$

## GRAMMARS OF THE DRAVIDIAN LANGUAGES

Of all the Dravidian tongues, Tamil has the oldest attested literature. More than 2000 poems, many of them from the 1st to the 3rd century A.D., are preserved in the Eight Anthologies that make up the Sangam literature, so called after the Tamil Academy or cañkam supposedly held at Madurai. ${ }^{1}$ Tamil also has the oldest grammatical-literary compendium, the Tolkāppiyam, which, in about 1610 verse-sūtra-s ${ }^{2}$ (in 3 sections: eluttu 'sound/letter,' col 'word,' porul 'subject matter'), comprises all literary activity. It is still an unsolved problem whether the Tolkāppiyam is older or younger than the Anthologies. While literature must precede literary theory, the theories found here could refer to older, now lost works. Tolkāppiyam's classification of genres forms the basis for the arrangement of the Anthologies: was it an ancient tradition or was it derived from an observation of the poetry collected for the anthologies? There are minor grammatical discrepancies between the Tolkāppiyam and these poems: the initial /y/ (e.g. yāru 'river') is preserved in the Tolkāppiyam but lost in the poems (āru); Tolkāppiyam II 221 prohibits the use of the first and second person optative-but such forms are found in the poems. ${ }^{3}$ If ōrai (III 133) is the astrological 'hour' (from the Greek $\omega \rho \alpha$ cf. Sanskrit hora), ${ }^{4}$ the earliest possible date for the Tolkāppiyam would be the 2nd century B.C. ${ }^{5}$

The original title of the work and the name of its author remain unknown. Following more recent fashion, the title Tolkāppiyam is formed from Tolkāppiyan, which is given in Panampāranar's preface (late Sangam period?) as the author's name or, rather, surname: Tolkāppiyan ena ttan peyar törri "having shown his name to be Tolkāppiyan ('One who [knows] old poetry').'6 The same

preface declares him to be full of aintiram which the commentators take as a reference to the Aindra-grammar. But, as the Aindra-grammar is only a late myth (10th cent. A.D.?), it is tempting to accept the proposal of K. Subramania Pillai, ${ }^{7}$ namely, to amend the text to read ain-tiram 'the five sections' which fits the work well even if there are only three formal sections: metrics and poetics are treated in the section on subject matter. Panampāranar's statement that Tolkāppiyan practiced padim $\bar{a}$ and Tolkāppiyan's own classification of beings by the number of their sense organs (III 571-577) suggest that he was a Jain. ${ }^{8}$ The popular association with Agastya, his supposed teacher, is first mentioned centuries later and deserves no credit. ${ }^{9}$ Still, it is certain that Tolkāppiyan had predecessors as his frequent statements "so they say" "so say the wise" indicate. Panampāranar says the work was presented at the court of the Pāntiya king Nilantaru Tiruvil in the presence of the scholar Atañkōṭtācān 'the teacher from Atañkōṭu' (a village in southern Travancore).

It is not quite clear whether an apparent unevenness (gaps and duplications in the grammatical description, ${ }^{10}$ unexpected placement of some rules ${ }^{11}$ ) should be blamed on the lax structure of the composition or on a faulty tradition of the text. Ignorance of a rule found in our text ${ }^{12}$ by the author of Yāpparunkala (10th cent. A.D.?) may be due to a lapse of memory or to a later interpolation. ${ }^{13}$ Older forms like kalapu appear in our manuscripts as kalavu, etc. ${ }^{14}$ The oldest commentary is by Ilampūranar (before 11th cent. A.D.?) who seems to have started a revival of Tolkāppiyam studies, followed by Teyvaccilaiyār (on 'word' only), Pērāciriyar, Cēnāvaraiyar (on 'word' only) and finally Naccinārkiniyar (14th cent.). The Tolkāppiyam in recent times is regarded as the main authority on 'Good Tamil' (cenramil), rivaled only by Nannūl, and largely accounts for

the surprising continuity of literary Tamil as used even now in novels or the news media.

The phonetic section shows the influence of the Prātisādhya-s. ${ }^{15}$ It is worth noting that the 'retroflex' consonants $/ \mathrm{t} /$ and $/ \mathrm{n} /$ are not retroflex in the Tolkāppiyam, though they are in later Tamil works (and in the Prātisādhya-s). The sound system (mixed up with graphemic representation ${ }^{16}$ ) is phonemic; there are doubts concerning only some of the five $n$ sounds. Also, there are three dependent sounds or allophones: shorter $i$, shorter $u$ and $\bar{a} y t a m$. The exact character of the last, whether it was a glottal stop/catch, a diacritical mark indicating voicing, or a fricative, ${ }^{17}$ is still not clear despite a large body of literature on the subject. Tolkāppiyan has developed an inquiry, first put forth in the Prātisādhya-s (Vājasaneyi Pr. I 85-89; Rgveda Pr. XII 1; Caturādhyāyikā I 3-7), into which sounds may stand in initial or final position and into which combination of consonants may occur generally. He rightly exempts metalinguistic references from these rules (I $47+66$ ). Tolkāppiyan does not refer to the non-phonemic voicing of intervocalic simple consonants in Tamil, but most scholars now assume that, despite the omission, this voicing is old and goes back to prehistoric times. ${ }^{18}$

The phonemic substitutions in sandhi and word formation are-in accordance with the Prātisādhya-s and some grammars-seen as 'change' or 'becoming' (I 189 ākum, 259 ākutal). Occasionally, the arbitrary procedure calls to mind the cynical remark ascribed to Voltaire in which he refers to etymology as a study "where consonants count little and vowels nothing:" tonnūru ' 90 ' is obtained from ongān ' 9 ' +paktu ' 10 ' and tollāyiram ' 900 ' from ongān ' 9 ' + $n \bar{u} r u$ ' 100 ' by ad hoc sound for sound substitutions, although tonnūru obviously contains nūru ' 100 ' and tollāyiram āyiram ' 1000 ' (I $445+463$ ). Another phonemic tour de force instead of proper analysis is the explanation of Cāttantai 'Cāttan's father' from Cāttan + tantai '[his] father' (Cātt[an]+[t]antai) where the occurrence of entai 'my father,' nuntai 'your father,' etc. should have suggested a bound form tai 'father' (I 348). ${ }^{19}$

case one might postulate an instrumental ending in $-\bar{a} \bar{n} / \bar{a} l$ and a sociative ending in -otu/ōtu, while the genitive in -atu may not be a case at all but a neuter adjectival form. The cases are named after their most common suffix (the endingless nominative is called eluvāy 'beginning, source') and are assigned standard values. ${ }^{20}$ Basic notions like agent, instrument, etc. are mentioned (II 108; II 80 has even karumam 'object,' Sanskrit karman) but are not the basis of the case syntax. Frequently, one case suffix is said to stand for another and the Tolkāppiyam contains the beginnings of the theory that the case suffixes serve different cases and assume different meanings while they do so (vērrumaimayakkam 'confusion of case signs'). ${ }^{21}$ All nouns belong to one of two classes: uyartinai 'higher class' (for humans) and aktinai 'non-class'; combining these classes with the grammatical number we get five $p \bar{a} l$ 'groups:' male sing., female sing., human plural, one object, objects. The verb must usually correspond to its coordinated nominative, but in exceptional cases a higher class noun is combined with a non-class verb (II 57). Verb forms are of two kinds: vinai 'action' proper (later called terinilai-vinai 'explicit action') and kurippu 'implied action' or 'nom pronominalisé' which is derived from nouns and has no tense marker. ${ }^{22}$ Many verb forms are taught through prototypes using the root cey 'do' as a model, inspired no doubt by the use of $\sqrt{k r}$ in early Sanskrit grammar (above, p. 127); the same technique is also used for noun formation. ${ }^{23}$

The classification of nominal compounds shows the influence of Mahābhāsya I $378,24-379,3$ when Tolkāppiyam II 413 lists those with the stress on the first member, second member, both or neither, corresponding to avyayibhāva, tatpuruṣa, dvandva and bahuvrīhi. ${ }^{24}$ More frequently there are six types: reflecting a case relation, reflecting a comparison, verbal compounds, qualifications, additive compounds, and possessive compounds.

Tolkāppiyan does not recognize adjectives as a separate category and this has been used to support the contention that Old Tamil lacked adjectives altogether. ${ }^{25}$ Whatever the validity of this claim, Sanskrit grammar has no separate category for adjectives either and the four word classes of Tolkāppiyan (noun, verb, formative element, particle) are clearly inspired by the four classes found in Nirukta I 1, etc.

From the time immediately following the Tolkāppiyam we have only fragments of other grammars, notably Avinayam (pre-9th cent. A.D.) which has influenced the author of Nannūl. ${ }^{26}$

In the 11th century the Buddhist petty king Puttamittirap wrote a grammar named Vīracōliya-kkārikai in honour of his overlord Vīrarācentira Cōlap; it was commented upon very soon by Peruntēvanār, possibly a disciple of the author. The five sections of a proper compendium (sound/letter, word, subject matter, metrics, poetics ${ }^{27}$ ) are here independent chapters with 181 verses in kattajai-kkali-tturai metre; the first two sections, the grammar proper, have 83 verses. One can put Puttamittirap's contribution under four headings: introduction of the terminology and theory of Sanskrit grammar, frequent references to the Sanskrit loan words in Tamil, observation of linguistic innovations and a greater conciseness of rules.

He introduced the six kāraka-s known from Pānini's grammar ${ }^{28}$ (verse 29) to explain the use of the eight cases. The other case suffixes are added (except in the vocative) to the endingless nominative. The opposition of the unmarked singular versus the marked plural is explained with a 'zero suffix' $c u$ (30; probably short for culi or cuṇnam 'zero'). The same 'zero suffix' is added in some present tense forms (66) and root nouns (62). The shifting relations of $k \bar{a} r a k a-s$ and case forms are defined with the help of 23 upakāraka-s 'accessories' (38-43): 'agent' has five, 'limit' two, 'instrument' two, 'recipient' three, 'object' seven and 'location' four. ${ }^{29}$ The vocative goes with the 2 nd person of the verb only, whereas all other cases can go with any person. Tāt $u$ (Sanskrit $d h \bar{a} t u$ ) is the verbal stem as seen in the 2 nd sing. imperative rather than the root; the similarity with pre-Pāṇinian thought is accidental. From stems, e.g. un 'eat,' we can form a causative (kāritam) ūttu 'feed,' a second causative (kārita-kkāritam) ūttuvi 'cause to feed' and a third causative (kārita-kkārita-kkāritam) üttuvippi. The Tamil infinite is called tum-anta in Sanskrit terminology. The implied verb is, if at all, mentioned only in passing (81). The sandhi section notes the forms of negation ( $a$-, an-, $n a$-) and guṇa/vṛddhi in Sanskrit words as they have become part of the Tamil language (10-12). The treatment of compounds is influenced by the Vararuci-kārikā-s. ${ }^{30}$ The treatment of tattita (taddhita) suffixes, true to its synchronistic character, covers both original Tamil and Sanskrit suffixes: -an in valai/y/an 'fisherman' and -ēya in Vainatēya

Puttamittiran has observed phonetic change in local dialects (merger of $l$ and $l$, of $r$ and $c$, intervocalic $l>y$, intervocalic $y>c$ ) and the emergence of the present tense suffix -kiṛa-. The palatalization of the initial /n/ if the preceding word ended in $i / i / a i$ (15) is very special-such forms are actually found in the hymns of Appā Tēvāram. Puttamittiran's rules are short and often omit the contexts that condition the application of rules.

At the beginning of the 13th century A.D., the Jain Kunavira-pantitar wrote his Nēminātam (named after the Jain tīrthamkara enshrined at Mylapore) as an easy grammar in 95 stanzas in the veṇp $\bar{a}$ meter. It has only two sections: sound/letter and word. In many ways it returns to the concepts of the Tolkāppiyam (the kāraka theory is abandoned) but it retains many of the Sanskrit terms and deals briefly with Sanskrit sandhi and ablaut (10f.). Modern forms are recognized along with the old forms ( $p \bar{e} r:$ peyar, pötu: polutu, -ötu: -otu [60]).

This grammar was overshadowed by the Naṇnūl 'Good Treatise' of another Jain from northwestern Tamilland, Pavananti, who wrote at about the same time under the patronage of the Ganga king Ciyakankan. It has three sections (preface, sound/letter, word) with 462 verses in $n \bar{u} r p \bar{a}$ meter. The propaedeutic preface, with its 55 verses, is, in the opinion of U.V. Swaminatha Aiyar, ${ }^{32}$ a later addition. The oldest commentator is Mayilainātar (14th cent.).

In his treatment of the linguistic development, Pavananti is more conservative than Puttamittiran and Kunavirapantitar. While he recognizes the popular palatalizations (e.g. aintu $>a \bar{n} c u$ ' $5^{\prime}$ ), he frequently returns to the Tolkāppiyam. The same generally holds for his terminology, although he does speak of pakuti 'base' (Sanskrit prakrti) and vikuti 'modification' (Sanskrit vikrti) and once even uses accu 'vowel' (Pāṇinian $a^{c}$ ). Pavananti uses the previous literature eclectically and makes his contribution with a lucid compilation. Among his well coined terms is cärp-eluttu 'dependent sound' for allophones.

Cuppiramaniya-titcitar (17th cent.) went beyond Puttamittiran in his application of Sanskrit terms and theories in his Pirayōka-vivēkam, and towards the end of the 17th century Vaittiyanāta Nāvalar wrote his Ilakkana-vilakkam based on the Tolkāppiyam, the Nannūl and their commentaries. In the 18th century, the Italian Jesuit C.J. Beschi (who also wrote two grammars on literary and colloquial Tamil in Latin) composed his Tognūl-vilakkam in the traditional style based on the Nannūl. He has also left a lasting imprint on the way Tamil is written today by his invention of modified letters for / $\bar{e} /$ and / $\delta$ / to contrast them with $/ \mathrm{e} /$ and $/ \mathrm{o} /$.

skrit and a vrtti in Malayālam, probably by the same author; ${ }^{33}$ historical references in the vrtti point to the years A.D. 1375-1400. There can be little doubt that the term mani-pravālam originally alluded to a kind of traditional South Indian jewelry encrusted with pearls and corals. The Līlātilakam reinterprets the term as referring to a combination of '(red) rubies and (red) corals' to reflect his different notion of the mani-pravālam style as it had developed in Kerala: not a contrastive use of Sanskrit and Dravidian but an amalgamation. ${ }^{34}$ The style has been called macaronic, but perhaps this is not correct. Its characteristic is not a supplementation of an author's Sanskrit vocabulary with vernacular stems ${ }^{35}$ or a Sanskritized vernacular-it is a real 'hybrid' style with two separate grammatical systems; Sanskrit words (coral) and Tamil words (ruby), ${ }^{36}$ with their respective endings, are blended in a sentence, with a preponderance of the vernacular (bhās $\bar{a}$ ). ${ }^{37}$ The words of the bhāsa are either regional, ${ }^{38}$ derived from Sanskrit or identical with Sanskrit.

In its phonology Līlātilakam considers the sounds that are peculiar to Tamil and cannot be derived from either Sanskrit or other vernaculars (Kannada, etc.). The phonemic distinction of $r$ and $r$ (uri 'measure:' uri 'hoop') is recognized; similarly the distinction of $\bar{n}$ and $n$ is phonemic in Tamil but not in Sanskrit (p. 79-82). ${ }^{39}$ Phonemes typical for Sanskrit (aspirate stops, $\dot{s}, s$, etc.) have entered the bhāsa through the Sanskrit words introduced by the members of the three upper classes (p. 115f.).

Bhoja, in his literary manual Sarasvatī-kanṭhābharaṇa II 27, calls it saṃkīrṇa [jāti] and compares it to a mixture of sesame and rice grains. Old Javanese poetry, too, mixes the vernacular (Javanese) with Sanskrit (K.M. Panikkar in C. Kunhan Raja Presentation Volume, p. 65-69).

The presentation of case suffixes follows the pattern found in the Tolkāppiyam and the Nannū̄l with minor adjustments (genitive $n n u$ and locative il/vil instead of atu and kan). Tamil cases should be used according to Tamil syntax, Sanskrit cases according to Sanskrit syntax; the opposite is condemned: the instr. in kānta-nōkkinōt-utsukam, analogous to Sanskrit kānta-darśanenôtsukam 'eager to see the beloved,' is a Sanskritism just like the acc. in divasatte nī̄rān 'he stood a day long' (p. 87). Surprisingly, Līlātilakam denies that the -e in avane-kontu 'with him,' lit. 'having taken him,' is an acc. suffix; it assumes instead a 'union vowel' (samdhāyaka) -e- (p. 88). ${ }^{40}$
A. R. Rājarājavarman (1863-1918)41 combines in his Kēraḷa-pāṇinīyam ${ }^{42}$ (written in modern Malayālam) Pānini-like description of his mother tongue with an historical insight into the Dravidian nature of the language. The influence of R. Caldwell's Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages and H. Gundert's Malayāla-vyākaraṇa is evident, but he avoids simple adoption of Western terminology as much as he avoids a mechanical application of Pāṇinian categories. Rājarājavarman recognizes that the Malayālam cases do not correspond one by one to the Sanskrit cases. He separates the 'agency' case in - $\bar{a} l$ from the 'society' case in -ōtu and correctly analyzes 'quasi-case formations' like atil-ninnu 'from it' as a loc. atil plus ninnu resulting in a pseudoablative. This grammar has influenced the course of modern Malayālam literature, steering a middle course between Sanskritizing and colloquial tendencies evident in the late 19th century writing.
The oldest Telugu ${ }^{43}$ grammar would be the Āndhra-sabda-cintāmani ( 82 to 90 āryā verses $=274$ sūtra-s in Sanskrit) if it is correctly ascribed to the poet Nannaya[bhaṭtu] (11th cent. A.D.); but that is disputed. It was commented on in Telugu prose by Elakūci Bālasarasvatī (c. 1550-1600), Appakavi, (c. 1600-1670) and Ahobalapati (c. 1700). Mulaghatika Ketana (1220-1300) wrote his Āndhra-bhāṣā-bhūṣaṇa in 192 Telugu verses, claiming this to be the first Telugu grammar. A few decades later, Atharvaṇācārya composed (besides a Telugu grammar in Sanskrit verses called the Vikrti-viveka supplementing the Āndhra-sabda-cintāmani) his Trilinga-sabdānuśāsana, an essay on the origins of the Telugu language. In the 19th century, the Bāla-vyākaraṇamu by Paravastu Cinnayasūri, in Telugu sūtra-s and arranged topically like the Siddhāntakaumudī, was so influential that its standards were even applied retroactively to

Nāgavarma (c. A.D. 1150) wrote the two oldest grammatical treatises ${ }^{44}$ on Kannada (Canarese): the Sabda-smrti (in Old Kannada, 96 verses) is part of his literary manual Kāvyāvalokana, whereas his Karṇāṭaka-bhāṣā-bhūṣaṇa (280 sūtra-s with a vrtti, both in Sanskrit) is an independent work; one of its ten sections deals with the kāraka concept of semantics. From the 13th century we have Keśirāja's Sabda-maṇi-darpaṇa in Old Kannada ( 322 sūtra-s in kanda metre and a vrtti); this comprehensive grammar of the Kannada language forms the basis for F. Kittel's Grammar of the Kannada Language. ${ }^{45}$ The Karṇātaka-śabdānuśāsana by Bhaṭtākalanka Deva is dated A.D 1604.

Its special merit is the study of the relation of Kannada to Sanskrit and Tamil, which shows the influence of F.W. Ellis. Phonetic correspondences between Tamil and Kannada words allow him to derive Kannada words from Tamil. A weakness is the occasional neglect of Old Kannada which lets him project developments within Kannada into the prehistoric period. The division of the vocabulary into five classes: tatsama 'identical [with Sanskrit],' tadbhava 'derived [from Sanskrit],' dēśya 'vernacular,' anyadēśya 'from another vernacular' and grāmya 'vulgar' shows, perhaps, the influence of Ketana's Telugu grammar. ${ }^{48}$

## OTHER SYSTEMS OF SANSKRIT GRAMMAR

A strong case can be made for the importance of princely patronage of grammatical studies. We can see three spurts of activity: in the 5th century A.D. (Candragomin, Bhartṛhari, Devanandin), the 11th to the 13th century A.D. (Kaiyaṭa, Bhoja, Hemacandra, Kramadiśvara, Anubhūtisvarūpa, Vopadeva, Puruṣottama, Trivikrama, Dāmodara) and in the 17th century A.D. (Bhattioji Dīkṣita and his school, Märkaṇdeya, Mīrzā Khān), which coincide with the Gupta dynasty, the prosperity of the Hindu kingdoms before the Muslim conquest and the height of the Mughal rule. Both Sanskrit and Prakrit studies profited from the favourable conditions. The political fragmentation of India before the Muslim conquest may well explain the creation of several original (i.e. non-Pāṇinian) systems of Sanskrit grammar. The renaissance of Pāṇinian studies led by Bhaṭtoji Dīkṣita (17th cent. A.D.) and his school coincided with the rise of Mahratta power which eclipsed the traditional patrons of several grammars; this renaissance swept these schools from the main part of India into residual pockets in Bengal, Kashmir, etc.

The first of these grammars is the Sarasvatī-kanṭhābharaṇa written by Bhoja, the King of Dhārā in western Madhya Pradesh. ${ }^{1}$ As the author says in his Rājamṛgānka, the grammar was composed in A.D. 1042. In eight books of four chapters each (with more than 6000 rules altogether), he incorporates the content of Kātyāyana's vārttika-s, the unādi-sūtra-s, the word lists, the Dhātupātha and the metarules. The arrangement is topical, beginning with definitions and metarules and ending with Vedic and accent rules. The other main topics are: primary suffixes, nominal and verbal endings (in the same book!), composition, feminine formation, secondary suffixes, and sandhi. Occasionally Bhoja recognizes forms or meanings that were condemned by earlier authorities but had nevertheless gained acceptance from Sanskrit writers. To give only one example: while Mahābhāsya II 399, 21 f. teaches himelu in the meaning 'unable to bear snow,' Sarasvatīkanṭhābharaṇa V 2226 has for it the meaning 'able to bear snow.' A commentary on this grammar, called Hṛdaya-hāriṇī, was written by Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa, possibly a courtier of the king.

The grammar Saṃkṣipta-sāra by Kramadiśvara (12th cent. A.D. or earlier) ${ }^{2}$

consists of c. 4000 sūtra-s in eight books. Jūmaranandin (13th cent. A.D.?) added a commentary, Rasavatī (or is it only the revision of an existing commentary?), and the school is often called Jaumara after him. ${ }^{3}$ The arrangement is very original: after the sandhi rules the verb is dealt with first; then the nouns are built up from primary and secondary noun formations, through kāraka relations, to inflected case forms and finally compounds. The eighth book is set aside for the Prakrits (cf. Hemacandra!).

An unconventional grammar is the Ukti-vyakti-prakaraṇa of Paṇdita Dāmodara who lived in Benares during the first half of the 12th century A.D. and tutored the sons of the Gāhadwāla king Govindacandra. Its 50 kārika-s in $\bar{a} r y \bar{a}$ meter deal in five chapters with verbs, the use of cases, the combination of semantic functions, letter writing in general and the writing of business letters in particular. About half of the appendix on transitive and intransitive verbs and the last two chapters of the author's own commentary are lost in the only existing manuscript. Dāmodara frequently refers to the Kātantra.

Dāmodara's idea is that the colloquial language (ukti) of his time, with all its deplorable deviation from Sanskrit, is but Sanskrit in disguise and can acquire dignity as the base for a renewed use of Sanskrit. This is possible because the noun and verb forms of Sanskrit have their correspondences in the colloquial and do not differ in meaning but only phonetically (yāny eva samskrta$b h a ̄ s a ̄ y a ̄ m ~ s u p-t i n ̄-a n t a ̄ n i ~ p a d a ̄ n i ~ t a ̄ n y ~ e v a ̄ p a b h r a m ̣ \bar{s} e ~ ' p i, ~ n a ~ c a ̄ r t h e ~ m a n a ̄ g ~ a p i ~}$ bhedah, kevalam aksaresu viparyayah; stanzas $6 / 7$ commentary). A problem arises when sometimes the colloquial, being simpler and more analytical than Sanskrit, offers only insufficient clues as to the correct Sanskrit form: in the distinction of genders, in case morphology and regarding the several past tenses of Sanskrit. The author's use of colloquial forms (e.g. kara $\bar{u}$ 'he shall do' >imperative/optative) as the point of departure for his transfer rules gives us virtually a grammar of the 12th century language of Benares, i.e. Old Kosali or Eastern Hindi, a forerunner of Tulsīdās' Awadhi by four hundred years. ${ }^{4}$ This testimony no doubt constitutes for us the book's greatest value. The two chapters on letter writing stand in an old tradition as the śasanadhikāra of the Arthaśāstra II 10 shows. ${ }^{5}$

Vopadeva (late 13th cent. A.D.), a member of a family of physicians in the service of the Yādava kings in Maharashtra, is the author of the Mugdhabodha

[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The subcommentary by Goyicandra (on the books I to VII only) is renowned for its lucid treatment of syntax in its kāraka section.
    ${ }^{4}$ The Mugdhāvabodhamauktika (written in A.D. 1394) similarly supplies us indirectly with a sketch of Old Gujerati grammar (G.A. Grierson, JRAS 1902. 537-555); cf. Sādhusundara Gani's Uktiratnākara (ed. Jinaviaya Muni; Jaipur, 1957) written in the time of Akbar with material from Rajasthani and neighbouring dialects.

(1184 sūtra-s in 26 sections). Besides this grammar, a root dictionary, etc., he has to his credit works on medicine, dharmasāstra and literature. The author's religious fervour is evident in the examples of his grammar that use the sacred names of Viṣnu and Śiva whenever possible. ${ }^{6}$ Vopadeva's most striking innovation is his algebraic terminology that goes far beyond that of Pānini and Devanandin; even the sound table has been altered to fit the peculiar design of the grammar. The author's originality, in the long run, was detrimental to his success: literary commentaries written with references to Pāṇini's grammar and the grammatical classics themselves were closed books to the students of the Mugdhabodha. The Mugdhabodha aims at brevity and simplicity; inflection rules are illustrated with partial paradigms, unusual forms and the Vedic language including the accents are all but neglected. ${ }^{7}$ The arrangement of topics is derived from the Kātantra and Dharmakīrti. As Vopadeva could formulate his rules to suit his arrangement (giving the kāraka relations their due!), one can imagine that the Mugdhabodha only narrowly lost out to the Siddhānta-kaumudī and the Pāṇinīya-s.
The origin of the Sārasvata-vyākaraṇa is shrouded in mystery; for the 700 Sarasvatī-sūtra-s ${ }^{8}$ which, according to one tradition, were revealed by the goddess Sarasvatī to Anubhūtisvarūpācārya (13th-14th cent. A.D.) were, according to another tradition, but a later creation. ${ }^{9}$ The leading text of the school is Anubhūtisvarūpācārya's Sārasvata-prakriyā (1494 sūtra-s). In the preamble the author claims: Sārasvatīm rjum kurve prakriyām nâtivistarām "I straighten out the procedure that goes back to Sarasvatī without undue prolixity." This statement is incompatible with the tradition of divine revelation to Anubhūtisvarūpācārya. Since Anubhūtisvarūpācārya does not refer to the 700 Sarasvatī-sūtra-s (nothing is said about doubling their number!), his words can be taken in either of two ways: sarasvatī may be used poetically as a synonym for 'speech,' meaning that the author simplified the complex structure of the language; or it could refer in an abbreviated form to an older grammar, namely the Sarasvatī-kanṭhābharaṇa (though at first glance no special relationship between these two works is visible). ${ }^{10}$ In his arrangement Anubhūtisvarūpācārya follows Dharmakīrti and Vopadeva very closely but stays within the conventional terminology. The Sārasvata grammar enjoyed for some time great popularity and was patronized by both Hindu and Muslim princes. It is striking

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Vopadeva was outdone in this respect by later sectarian grammarians, e.g. the authors of the two Harināmāmrta-s, Rūpagosvāmin and Jivagosvāmin (15th and 16th cent. A.D.) who use God's names even for technical expressions (e.g. Purusottama $=$ 'long') as the mere uttering of the names was regarded as beneficial.
    ${ }^{7}$ As happened with the Kātantra, later followers supplemented the work with further rules to cover every odd form.
    ${ }^{8}$ These were commented on by Rāmacandrāśrama (not later than the 16th cent. A.D.) in his Siddhānta-candrikā.

that all earlier authors of the school were samnyāsin-s, religious devotees who renounced the world; it would seem that a simplified grammar met the samny $\bar{a}$ sin's need of a working knowledge of Sanskrit just as it satisfied the educational desires of the ruling class. The great number of textbooks in the form of subcommentaries written by court pandits shows that the pressure to 'publish or perish' existed long before our time.

In search of prestige the rulers of Mithila and of Cooch Bihar commissioned the Saupadma grammar by Padmanābhadatta (14th cent. A.D.) and the Prayoga-ratna-mālā by Puruṣottama (16th cent. A.D.). Efforts to teach Sanskrit by the 'direct method' produced conversation manuals: Varadarāja's Gīrvāṇa-padamañjarī and Kāśinātha's Pradīpa; ${ }^{11}$ but we must also consider that traditional pandits probably taught Sanskrit by the direct method since time immemorial, even without specially devised conversational manuals.

## GRAMMARS OF THE MIDDLE INDO-ARYAN DIALECTS

For the educated Brahmin, the 'common' (prākṛta) language was meaningful only insofar as it reminded him of the correct Sanskrit form familiar to him; but common speakers would understand the Prakrit words immediately and would even assert that for them the Sanskrit forms conveyed meaning only through the Prakrit forms they brought to their mind (Vākyapadīya I 151-155). The poet Vākpati (8th cent. A.D.) thus regards Prakrit as the source of all languages, including Sanskrit:
sayalāo imam vāyā visanti etto ya nenti vāyāo
enti samuddam ciya nenti sāyarāocciya jalāim
Gaūḍavaho 93
"All languages enter this [Prakrit] and all languages take their start from this: the waters enter nowhere but into the sea, and start from nowhere else than from the sea."

Conversely, Hemacandra in his commentary on his own rule VIII 11 explains that "Sanskrit is the base; what originates in it or comes from it is base-derived" (prakrtiḥ samskrtam; tatra bhavam tata āgataṃ vā prākrtam).

It is hard to believe that the early Jains and Buddhists, who pioneered the translation of canonical texts from one vernacular to another, should not have given any thought to grammar; but other than occasional remarks in their scriptures they have left us no systematical treatises.

The oldest pieces of Prakrit grammar are perhaps the fragments preserved in chapter XVII of the Bharata-Nātyasāstra (hardly later than the first centuries A.D.). The first fragment, the stanzas 6 to 9 composed in the popular $\bar{a} r y \bar{a}$ meter, gives phonemic rules for the conversion of Sanskrit words into Prakrit; the most interesting feature of these stanzas is that they are written in Prakrit themselves. ${ }^{1}$ In the Sanskrit stanzas that follow ( 10 to 23 ), the examples are displayed more prominently than the rules; the rules are abstracted from the examples. Evidently the Nātyasāstra, being a manual for actors, was less interested in comprehensive grammatical rules than in a number of characteristic expressions. In the stanzas 25 to 56 , Sanskrit and the various vernaculars are assigned to stage personalities: gods and brahmins speak

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Such a tradition of grammatical rules in Prakrit may have existed among the Jains (A.N. Upadhye, ABORI 13.45f.); a few such rules are quoted in later texts.
Sanskrit, employees of the royal harem Māgadhī, and guild masters Ardhamāgadhī, etc. On a different level again, stanzas 57 to 61 advise the actor to play persons from Bihar with an abundance of /e/ sounds, people from Sindh with many / $/ \mathrm{u} /$ sounds in their speech, etc.: a superficial mimicking of the real dialects.

A much more detailed account of Prakrit is the Prākṛta-prakāśa (or Prākṛta-lakṣaṇa-sūtra; title uncertain) attributed to the elusive author Vararuci; the eight books (with altogether about 420 sūtra-s in Sanskrit) in fact deal only with Mahārāstrī. The great number of permitted duplicates and the striking correspondences with forms occurring in Hāla's collection, Sattasaī (2nd cent. A. D.), suggest that the rules were abstracted from a similar collection of popular songs with regional grammatical differences.

In the 7th century A.D., the Prākṛta-prakāśa was commented on by the rhetorician Bhāmaha whose text however includes two additional books: one on the Paiśācī dialect and the other on Māgadhī, both of which are unknown to the other and much later commentators of the text. ${ }^{2}$ Some time after Bhāmaha, book V was split into two when yet another book (on Saaurasenī) was added, making a round number of 12 books.

The Prākṛta-prakāśa evidently presumes a knowledge of Pāṇini's grammar, and lists, without any introduction, transfer rules that allow the connoisseur of Sanskrit to form correct Mahārāstrī poetry. The starting point is the Sanskrit language in its pre-use stage: the suffix of the nom. sing. is still $s^{u}$, that of the gen. sing. still ${ }^{a} a s$ when they are replaced by $\bar{o}$ and ssa. Instead of dative suffixes the genitive suffixes are used and plural forms replace dual forms. The difficulty of formulating precise transfer rules leads to an excessive use of 'often' and 'or' in all Prakrit grammars; the practice has its forerunner in Pāṇini's treatment of Vedic forms (bahulam chandasi Pāṇini II 4 39, etc.).

An 'eastern school' of Prakrit grammarians expanded Vararuci's opus closely following, in the main part, Vararuci's rules for Mahārāstrī and then dealing with the stage Prakrits similarly to the Nātyaśāstra; they add a treatment of Paísācī and Apabhramśa. The oldest of the grammars preserved ${ }^{3}$ is Puruṣottama's ${ }^{4}$ Prākṛtānuśāsana (12th cent. A.D.) preserved in a single manuscript; Mārkaṇdeya wrote his Prākṛta-sarvasva in the 17th century or earlier, remarkable for his philological acumen and reliability; Rāmaśarman's Prākṛta-kalpataru (17th cent.) again survives in a single manuscript. These authors lived at a time in which direct observation of spoken Prakrits can be ruled out; they had to rely instead on the grammatical tradition (which they often misunderstood) and on a study of available manuscripts of the Prakrit classics (with a broad

[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Vasantarāja's Prākṛta-saṃjīvanī (14th-15th cent.), Sadānanda's Prākṛta-subodhinī, anonymous Prākṛta-mañjarī, Nārāyaṇa Vidyāvinoda's Prākṛta-pāda and Rāmapāṇivāda's Vṛtti (18th cent.).
    ${ }^{3}$ The frequent references to the teachings of Śākalya suggest that an author of this name wrote a Prakrit grammar that is now lost (L. Nitti-Dolci, Les grammairiens prakrits, p. 95).

spectrum of variant readings). The problem of how far we should go in correcting the Prakrit literature to conform with the rules of the grammarians is not easy to decide; the manuscript fragments of some dramas found in the sands of Turkestan are actually earlier than any of these grammarians.

The Jain Hemacandra Sūri (A.D. 1089-1172) taught the Prakrits through transfer rules as did Vararuci; it was only logical that he offered these 1119 rules in the eighth and last book of his Sanskrit grammar (above, p. 169). ${ }^{5}$ The transfer rules follow the rules on Sanskrit grammar and close with the statement that in all remaining respects Prakrit is like Sanskrit (śesam samskrtavat siddham). Hemacandra's formulations depend heavily on Vararuci, with many additional rules on the 'basic Prakrit' (i.e. Mahārāstrī) inserted here and there. He is the first author we know of to state the obvious rule that a long vowel before a consonant cluster is shortened in the transformation: VIII 184 hrasvah samyoge. Hemacandra's treatment of Māgadhī, Paiṡācī and Śaurasenī shows the influence of a lost treatise of which we have a reflection in the commentary of the Jain Namisādhu (A.D. 1069) on Rudraṭa's Kāvyālaṃkāra II 12. More original are his contributions concerning the language of the canonical Jain scriptures, the Ardhamāgadhī, which he calls $\bar{a} r s ̣ a$ '[language] of the saints'; almost all the special forms have been verified from the texts. Apabhramśa too receives a detailed treatment, illustrated with many stanzas called doha $\bar{a}$ taken from then current poetry. Differing from other Prakrit grammars, Hemacandra's Apabhramśa appears more as one well defined language, even though dialectal differences can be found in the illustrations; it is a forerunner of Old Gujerati. ${ }^{6}$

Kramadiśvara (12th cent. A.D. or earlier) also treated Prakrit in the eighth book of his Sanskrit grammar, the Samkṣiptasāra (above, p. 187f.). But the eighth book has not enjoyed the same popularity as the rest of the work and manuscripts of it are extremely rare. Kramadiśvara based his work on Vararuci, whose description he tries to shorten in several ways. The optional replacement $a>i$ taught by Vararuci for several words (I 3 id iṣat-pakva-svapna-vetasavvajana-mrdan̄gân̄gāreṣu) is abbreviated to VIII 12 it pakvâdeh" /i/[for the /a/] in pakva, etc." (e.g. pikka as well as pakka 'ripe'). It is interesting to see that Hemacandra VIII 147 takes a middle position: he lists three nouns and avoids the use of 'etc.' Kramadiśvara VIII 2 6f. joins Hemacandra VIII 1180 in recognizing the ya-sruti, i. e. a hiatus-removing /y/inside a word (e.g.nagaram $>$ naaram $>$ nayaram). The few obvious similarities and deep differences do not yet allow any inference on the relative chronology of Kramadiśvara and Hemacandra.

the author's own vrtti, consists of c. 1036 sūtra-s with a technical terminology that includes newly defined determinatives. Some scholars believe that the sūtra-s are metrical and should be so written; but as sūtra-s often straddle the assumed metrical divisions, this does not seem to be a good idea. Some commentators on the text suggest that the sūtra-s are not really Trivikrama's but Vālmīki's. But there seems to be no doubt that both sūtra-s and commentary depend heavily on Hemacandra, and the author himself acknowledges his debt to his predecessors down to Hemacandra, thus excluding any intermediary. The third book of Trivikrama's work is valuable because of the many Apabhramśa stanzas quoted in it.

Rishikesh Sastri's Prākṛta-vyākaraṇa, with English translation (Calcutta, 1883), treats basically Mahārāṣtrī and refers to other dialects in footnotes. Rules are formulated for multiple application only, whereas unique developments are listed in the tables. Inflection rules are supplemented by paradigms under the influence of European grammars. Probably also a recent work is Canda's Prākṛta-lakṣana, although its editor, A.F.R. Hoernle (Calcutta, 1880), believed he had a text of the 3rd century B.C.; no manuscripts of it have been found that are earlier than the second half of the 19th century A.D.

It is possible that Buddhaghoṣa (5th cent. A.D.), the Buddhist commentator of Pāli texts, refers to a lost Pāli grammar when he discusses grammatical questions. But the first Pāli grammar we have is the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa written between the 5th and the 11th centuries A.D. in the Pāli language; the oldest known commentary on it is Vimalabuddhi's Nyāsa (11th cent. A.D.).Its four kappa-s, with c. 675 sutta-s, deal with phonology, nouns (including kāraka-s, secondary word formation and compounds), verbs, and primary word formation. The author relied on the Aṣṭādhyāyī as well as the Kātantra. ${ }^{8}$ The Sanskrit influence is visible in the recognition of a separate dative case even though its forms are identical with those of the genitive; only rarely do original dat. sing. forms in -āya occur. The different case suffixes of the various noun classes are derived from a set of standard suffixes by substitutions. Among the several recasts of this grammar, the Rūpasiddhi of Buddhappiya Dīpamkara (late 13th cent. A.D.) is the most prominent; commentaries on Kaccāyana's grammar exist both in Pāli and in Sinhalese. ${ }^{9}$

Aggavamsa from Arimaddana in Burma was the teacher of King Narapati Sithu of Pagan. He composed his voluminous Saddamiti in the year A.D. 1154 and a copy of it was soon taken to Ceylon. The work was well received in both countries. Aggavamsa largely follows Kaccāyana but achieved a much more

[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ R.O. Franke's attempt to show influence of the Kāśikā (Geschichte und Kritik der einheimischen Pāli-Grammatik und -Lexicographie, p. 17-19) is not convincing. Illustrations like pāthayati mūṇavakam vedam, which the Kāśikā on I 452 copies from Candravṛtti on II 144, are clearly older than the Buddhist Candragomin and cannot prove Franke's point even if they should have influenced Kaccāyana's formulation of rule II 630.

complete description of Pāli than the latter. The work consists of three main parts: the Padamālā, a detailed morphology of the 'word and paradigm' type beginning with the verb (cf. Kramadīśvara!) followed by noun, pronoun and numeral; the Dhātumālā, a root list ${ }^{10}$ with a comprehensive survey of the attested verbal and nominal derivatives and compounds (cf. Maitreyarakṣita's Dhātupradīpa!); the Suttamālā, which in 1347 sutta-s covers the same ground as the two previous parts, but this time in the 'item and process' manner, closely following Kaccāyana. ${ }^{11}$

Moggallāna from the Thūpārāma monastery in Anurādhapura wrote his Māgadha ${ }^{12}$ Saddalakkhana during the reign of Parakkamabāhu I (A.D. 11531186). In six kaṇda-s he treats phonology and metarules, noun inflection, compounds, secondary noun formation, secondary roots and primary noun formation, and verb inflection. The influence of Candragomin ${ }^{13}$ is evident in the avoidance of several technical terms, e.g. the kāraka-s; the syntactic rules II 2-42 are strikingly similar to Candragomin's II 1 43-98. In addition to Moggallāna's own commentaries vutti and pañcik $\bar{a}$ (the latter is lost), there is a large body of literature on this system, both in Pāli and in Sinhalese.

Though the specialists evidently knew Sanskrit, it was less important for the Buddhist communities of the Theravāda tradition than Pāli. It is not surprising therefore that the Pāli grammarians did not derive this canonical language from Sanskrit; nor did they teach it in a transfer grammar based on Sanskrit. Though they depended totally on the known body of Pāli literature, their subsequent influence on the canonical texts must be considered in any linguistic-philological study of the Theravāda canon.

A Sinhalese classic is Vedeha Thera's (?) grammar of the Old Sinhalese poetic style (Elu), the Sidat-sangarāva, written in Elu in the 13th century A.D. Besides Pānini, Kātantra and Moggallāna, it is influenced by the Tamil grammar Vīracōliyam and, like the latter, includes the elements of poetics. In the traditional Tamil way consonants are likened to the 'body' and vowels to 'life' (gatakuru and pañakuru; gātrākṣara and prāṇ̣̄kṣara in Sanskritized Sinhalese). ${ }^{14}$

    ${ }^{11}$ Aggavarnsa breaks up the long chapter on nouns, and treats kāraka-s, compounds and secondary noun formation separately. The kāraka-s (with the sole exception of okāsa 572) receive dual values (548-555), e.g. yo kurute yo vā jāyati so kattā "Who does or who is born is an agent"; Kaccāyana has only two such formulations (Kaccāyana II 61 and 6 ).

## GRAMMARS OF THE NEW INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES

Because of the Indian preoccupation with the classical languages and perhaps partly due to a lack of patronage in times of foreign domination, grammatical descriptions of several modern Indian languages were first undertaken by European missionaries and scholar-administrators. The need was greatest in the early phases of European influence and decreased later as the local people acquired a working knowledge of the European language spoken by their superiors. These works, e.g. Father Stephens' Konkani grammar (16th cent. A.D.), ${ }^{1}$ J.J. Ketelaer's (i.e. Kettler) Hindostani grammar (1715) ${ }^{2}$ and Manoel da Assumpçam's Bengali Grammar (1734), ${ }^{3}$ fall outside the present survey.

But already during the rule of Aurangzêb and, we can further specify, prior to the year 1676, Mîrzā Khân Ibn Fakḥru-d-Dîn Muḥammad wrote a short grammar of Braj bhāṣā as part of the introduction to his literary compendium Tuḥfatu-l-Hind 'A present from India,' written in the Persian language. His intention was to introduce the art of Braj poetry to the Muslim ruling class. He took great care in assigning the appropriate Arabic letter to Indian sounds, though his phonetic terminology is not scientific; he differentiates $d, d h, d$ and $d h$ as 'lighter d', 'heavy d', 'd rendering itself heavy' and 'heaviest d'. In the morphology he always mentions alongside the Persian term its Indian equivalent and spells it out meticulously. It is interesting that these terms are not in Sanskrit form but in a vernacular garb: sandachhar (Sanskrit sandhyakşara 'diphthong'), binjan (vyañjana 'consonant'), purling (pumliniga 'masculine'), astriling (strilinga 'feminine'), kirt (*krta 'object'), etc. The author differentiates between those feminine nouns that have a masculine counterpart (e.g. hastani 'female elephant') and those 'irregular ones' that do not (e.g. agan 'fire'). Many instances of old composition he regards as cases of suffixation, e.g. bh $\bar{u} p$ 'king,' originally a compound of $b h \bar{u}$ 'earth' and $p \bar{a}$ 'rule' is analyzed as $b h \bar{u}$ 'earth' with a suffix $-p$ indicating 'lordship.' Another work in the Islamic tradition is Inshā Allāh Khān's Urdū grammar Daryā-e-Laṭāfat (A.D. 1802) written in Persian.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ H. Saldanha, BSOS 8.718-720. The grammar was not published until 1640.
    ${ }^{2}$ J.Ph. Vogel, BSOA 8.817-822.
    ${ }^{3}$ Manoel da Assumpçam possibly was not the sole author of the grammar, but edited the work of others (Muhammad A.R. Kbondkar, The Portuguese contribution to Bengali prose, grammar and lexicography, Doctoral dissertation, University of London, 1971, p. 244-246).
The author of the first Marathi grammar is Venkataa Mādhava, a lecturer of Marathi at the Fort St. George College in Madras. His three works on Marathi (as it was spoken by the large Maratha colony in Tanjore!) exist only in the autographs of the author or his assistant Bhīma Pandita. The Mahārāș̣traprayoga-candrikā (c. 1827) has 227 sūtra-s in Sanskrit and is accompanied by a Sanskrit commentary, a Marathi commentary and Marathi illustrations; the Sanskrit section is written in Devanāgari script, the Marathi in Modī script. The grammar, which generally follows the Siddhānta Kaumudī in its design, was probably meant to introduce Marathi to the neighbouring Tamil speakers. ${ }^{4}$

The Kashmirian Iśvara Kaula (1833-1893) wrote his Kaśmīra-sabdāmrta in 1875 and revised it in 1879. As his object was to describe the Hindu dialect of Shrinagar, he eschewed the use of the Arabic script and created a modified Devanāgari script through the addition of diacritical marks. The phonemes of Kāśmirī are classified as prasiddha 'known [from Sanskrit]' and aprasiddha 'unknown'; several phonemes of Sanskrit on the other hand are not found in Kāśmirī (introduction). The work consists of 778 sūtra-s in nine books and a commentary in which examples are often translated into Hindi. Iśvara Kaula follows the terminology and arrangement of the Kātantra, with a few interesting innovations: e.g. the three persons are characterized as $a$-śroty ${ }^{\text {'non- hearer' }}=\mathrm{he}$, śroty 'hearer' = you, and vakty 'speaker' =I (VIII 1 3) and the agent of the causative is defined as "the imposition of being an agent to somebody else's action in case of default of the proper agent" (VIII 41 svākartṛtvāvasare para-kriyākartṛtvāropo hetuh). The Dhātupātha, here rather a list of verb stems than of roots (with an additional list of roots that have only nominal derivatives), is incorporated into the text as book VII.

Under the influence of Western linguists a new school of historical and descriptive Indian linguists developed early in this century, culminating in the founding of the Linguistic Society of India (1928). Soon after the attainment of Indian independence, the Language Project at Poona (1954-1959), supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, gave the necessary stimulus for expanded institutional research in university departments and advanced centres which were generously supported by the University Grants Commission. The influence of Bloomfieldian and Chomskyan linguistics has occasionally led to a neglect of the historical-literary implications and the abandoning of the Indian concept of vāg-arthāv iva samprktau 'fused like word and meaning' (Raghuvaṃśa I 1). But these problems as well as the achievements of contemporary Indian linguists are no longer specifically Indian and belong rather in a history of modern linguistics. ${ }^{5}$
