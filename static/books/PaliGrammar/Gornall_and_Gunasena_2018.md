# A History of the Pali Grammatical Tradition of South and Southeast Asia by Vaskaḑuvē Subhūti (1876), Part I 

Alastair Gornall and Amal Gunasena


#### Abstract

This article is a translation of a history of the Pali grammatical traditions of South and Southeast Asia written by the nineteenth-century Sri Lankan scholar-monk Vaskaḑuvē Subhūti (1876). In this first instalment, Subhūti comprehensively describes the works of the Kaccāyana grammatical tradition of Pali grammar. He provides important historical information about seventeen Pali grammatical works along with long excerpts from each grammar that illustrate their content and their relationship within the tradition as a whole.


## PART ONE:

THE KACCĀYANA-VYĀKARASA:
ITS COMMENTARIES AND MAJOR HANDBOOKS

## INTRODUCTION

Vaskaḑuvē Subhūti (1835-1917) was one of the most prominent scholarmonks in nineteenth-century Sri Lanka and a founding figure in the academic study of Buddhism in Europe. ${ }^{1}$ His two most celebrated works were an edition and translation of the Abhidhāna-ppadīpikā, a twelfthcentury Pali lexicon, and the Nāma-mālā, a grammar of the Pali language. Subhūti prefaced his Nāma-mālā with a Sinhala introduction detailing the history of the Pali grammatical traditions of South and Southeast Asia. ${ }^{2}$ In this introduction Subhūti meticulously describes over sixty Pali grammars, their authorship and historical context, and quotes

long passages from them to illustrate their content and interrelationship. In this regard Subhūti's introduction contains a lot of useful information on the intellectual history of Theravāda Buddhism in general and is much more than a mere handlist of Pali grammars.

Early Orientalists interested in Pali grammar were aware of Subhūti's work but were often unable to use it in detail since it was written in Sinhala. In what is still the most comprehensive study of the Pali grammatical tradition, R.O. Franke in his Geschichte und Kritik der einheimischen Pāli-Grammatik und -Lexicographie (1902) notes the existence of Subhūti's work and refers to the Rev. Richard Morris' view that it was "das beste der auf Ceylon erschienenen Bücher über PāliGrammatik". ${ }^{1}$ Although he was unable to read Sinhala, Franke frequently refers to the work to confirm the names of the grammatical texts he discusses and further relies on Subhūti's work, among other sources, for his list of preliminary, unclassified "mostly unimportant" Pali grammatical works ("Liste der übrigen vorläufig unklassificeirbaren und meist unwichtigen Werke über Pāli-Grammatik"), the details of which, such as their affiliated grammatical tradition, he could not say anything or anything reliable ("über deren Schulzugehörigkeit etc. ich Nichts oder Nichts Verlässliches aussagen kann"). ${ }^{2}$ Many of these minor grammatical texts, mostly handbooks, have yet to be described in adequate detail and the third and final part of our translation of Subhūti's work, which we intend to publish soon, will describe these unexplored texts.

The first part of our translation presented here covers the first seventeen grammatical texts dealt with by Subhūti and forms an overview of the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa, its commentaries and major handbooks. The second instalment will deal with the Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa, its commentaries and handbooks, and also the Sadda-nīti. The final and third part of

    ${ }^{2}$ Franke refers to Subhūti's work nine times to either confirm the name of a particular grammatical work, to note the existence of a grammar, or, occasionally, to give some information about a text (p. 22, n. 8; p. 23, n. 13; p. 24, n. 16; p. 29; p. 30, n. 42; p. 31, n. 2a; p. 39, n. 7; p. 45, n. 1; p. 47). In his final section (1902: 53-56) on "meist unwichtigen Werke" he refers to Subhūti's introduction a further fifteen times to note the possible existence of grammatical texts he had no other information about.
Subhūti's introduction will focus on other, minor Pali grammatical handbooks. Since Subhūti's work was composed in 1876, the subsequent studies of R.O. Franke and, more recently, O.H. Pind, ${ }^{1}$ have superseded Subhūti's work in terms of the historical information they provide about some of these grammars. In the footnotes we have referred to both R.O. Franke's Geschichte und Kritik and Pind's "Pali Grammar and Grammarians" as well as other contemporary studies when this is the case. Subhūti's own discussion of the historical contexts of these works was based on the colophons of the manuscripts he used, the citations of other grammars contained in these works, and also on the Sāsana-vaṃsa, a Burmese Pali history composed in 186 I. ${ }^{2}$

There are other areas, however, where Subhūti's work remains relevant and important for the study of the Pali grammatical tradition. Firstly, as mentioned, he provides details about Pali grammars that neither Franke nor Pind had access to or knew much about, such as the Kaccāyana-vaṇṇanā, Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā, Rūpasiddhi-ṭikā, and Bālā-vatāra-ṭikā discussed below. Secondly, unlike both Franke and Pind, Subhūti quotes long Pali passages from each of the texts he discusses and always quotes their incipit and colophon. While Subhūti left these passages untranslated, we have provided readable English translations of them so that readers can get a sense of the nature of Pali grammatical writing and how the tradition developed over time. Generally speaking, Subhūti chose commentarial passages from each work on Kaccāyana's first rule of sandhi (Kacc 12, sarā sare lopam "vowels before a vowel are to be elided"). Finally, we might add that Subhūti's work is in itself valuable as a historical document for understanding nineteenth-century Sri Lanka's intellectual culture and as one of the first modern essays written in Sinhala. ${ }^{3}$

While translating the quoted passages of the various Pali grammars we have sometimes found it necessary to consult an available edition of a

# TRANSLATION 

Having paid homage to the Sugata, the greatest ornament of the three worlds, to the Dhamma, and to the taintless community, I have properly compiled this Nāma-mālā by relying upon what can be discovered in the essential thought of the ancient teachers.

Vyākaraṇa is the science of writing and speaking a language without fault and of understanding the intentions of texts by knowing all the divisions and syntactic relations of a language's expressions. Vyākaraṇa is not exclusive to one language but is for all languages. Some languages that were used in former times, however, do not have complete grammars since the principal users of these languages were uncivilised and were of weak intellect. The existence of a very complete and pristine grammatical literature in Sanskrit and Pali, by contrast, is a testament to the sharp intellects of the users of these languages. Regardless of the relative age of the two languages, Sanskrit vyākaraṇa is the older of the two traditions and Pali grammatical literature reveals that it was composed using Sanskrit vyākaraṇa as a model.

One should not only aim to study Pali grammatical science to be able to preach the Dhamma to people in general, but one must learn it thoroughly to become proficient in understanding perfectly the subtle parts of the Buddha's teaching that dispense his perfect knowledge.

The learned who know these two languages in detail realise that obtaining complete proficiency in the study of Pali vyākaraṇa is a cause of great difficulty for one who has not had much training in Sanskrit
vyākaraṇa. This is another indication that Pali grammatical science is modelled on Sanskrit vyākaraṇa. In addition, the teachers who wrote commentaries and sub-commentaries, such as the Līnattha-pakāsinī, on the Buddha's teaching, [p. 2] and who wrote commentaries on Pali grammatical literature, display great capability in Sanskrit vyākaraṇa. There is no doubt that this education in vyākaraṇa was the main reason they were perfectly able to compose these commentaries. At the time of the great king Parākramabāhu I, the great Sāriputta svāmipāda, who lived in Polonnaruva, composed works such as the Sārattha-dīpanī, a Vinaya subcommentary, which in size is equal to thirty thousand granthas; the Aṅguttara-nikāya sub-commentary, which in size is equal to twenty thousand granthas; the Vinaya-saṅgaha; the Abhidharmārtha-saṅgrahārthavyākhyāna; and the [Cāndra]-pañcikā-ṭikā. ${ }^{1}$ The following verses reveal the extent of Sāriputta's knowledge of Sanskrit and other subjects:

In pleasant Pulatthinagara, the emperor of cities, Sāriputta dwelt in the Jetavana, a delightful monastery with pleasant mansions and manifold groves commissioned by the strong-armed king Parakkamabhuja.
An ascetic and virtuous guru, his fame had spread far and wide. He was skilled and a repository of purity born in a completely pure lineage. He was an expert in religion and philosophy, among other subjects, and the best of ascetics....
They regard him as an essential author, like Candra, the sharpest of intellects, in the Cāndra [grammatical] tradition, Pāṇini in the Pāṇinian [grammatical] tradition, as like the cleverest of intellects in all of philosophy, and as like Kālidāsa - a cause of bliss in the hearts of poets - in poetic skill. May this composition of Sāriputta's grant success to the world. ${ }^{2}$
${ }^{1}$ Dragomir Dimitrov (2010) has recently published a facsimile edition of a manuscript of a $t \bar{t} k \bar{a}$ on the Cāndra-pañcikā. Further work is needed to determine with certainty whether this work is identical with the commentary composed by Sāriputta. On Sāriputta's Vinaya works, see Crosby (2006) and Kieffer-Pillz (2015).
${ }^{2}$ Abhidh-s-an (Nm 2; C ${ }^{\text {P }}$ 257):
ramme pulatthinagare nagarādhirāje | raññā parakkamabhujena mahābhujena || kārāpite vasati jetavane viñāre | yo rammahammiyavarūpavanābhirāme || sabbatthapatthatayasena visāradena | suddhāsayena parisuddhakulodayena || takkāgamādikusalena yatissarena | sārīsutena yatinā gurunā guṇena ... (io verses omitted, Nm) || yañ cande candabhūtaṃ nisitataramatiṃ pāṇinim
The venerable Šrī Rāhula svāmipāda of Toṭagamuva - the lord of six languages who composed many essential works, such as the Moggallāna-pañcikā-pradīpaya, the Buddhi-ppasādanī, and the Kāvyasēkhara - not only studied Sanskrit but also many religions. The following verses reveal this:

I take great pleasure in attaining mastery of the many different śāstras, doctrines, languages and the entire Tipiṭaka. Long live king Parākramabāhu! ${ }^{1}$

We can also know that venerable commentators like Buddhaghosa studied subjects outside the Pali canon from statements in the commentaries such as "capable of grasping and diving into the depths of his own doctrine and the doctrine of others, possessing a high degree of wisdom...". ${ }^{2}$ [p. 3] As such, one who has studied one of the two languages will find studying the other one a worthwhile and easy task. Some think that there are not three languages in the world as mutually similar as Pali, Sanskrit, and Prakrit. And if one thinks about it carefully, it is because of their similarity that someone who is educated in one language can understand the other two languages when they are being spoken. After a while, one can also understand a certain amount of their literature, even though it is not completely intelligible at first. Even though the difference that exists between one language and another in the world is as great as the difference between a human and an animal, these three languages can be likened to three sons born of the same father who only differ slightly in colour. The extent of the similarity of these languages is also reflected in their grammars.

The science of Pali vyākaraṇa is therefore divided into seven subdivisions, namely, (I) sandhi (euphonic junction), (2) nāma (nominal

declension), (3) samāsa (compounding), (4) taddhita (nominal derivatives), (5) $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ (verbal conjugation), (6) kitaka (verbal derivatives), and (7) kāraka (semantico-syntactic relations).
(1) Sandhi refers to the procedure of joining two words together in a euphonic junction. When it is understood, one is also able to separate the words in texts that have been joined together in sandhi. For instance, the two words loka and aggo form lokaggo when they are joined together according to the procedure given in the sandhi chapter. With this understanding one is able to separate the sandhi of the canonical expression guñaggo into its components guña + aggo.
(2) Nāma refers to the procedure of dividing a word into seven cases, the first, etc., and into singular and plural and declining it.
(3) Samāsa refers to the formation of one word with a single meaning from two words that have separate meanings. For instance, a word such as nīlaṃ, with its meaning of "blue", and a word such as uppalaṃ, with its meaning of "water lily", separately signify their meanings. When they are both made into one word (that is to say formed in a compound), the compound nīluppalaṃ (blue water lily) is formed denoting a single meaning.
(4) Taddhita refers to giving a suffix a particular meaning after a nominal stem and then combining that suffix with the nominal stem. For example, the suffix $N a$ is given the sense of "being his son" after a word such as Vasiṭtha. When the word Vasiṭtha and the suffix Na are joined together, the word Vāsiṭtha is formed [p. 4]. The nominal derivative Vāsiṭtha means "the son of Vasiṭ̣ha".
(5) $\bar{A} k h y \bar{a} t a$ refers to the rules for forming verbs by adding suffixes to a verbal base. The word pacati (he cooks), for instance, is formed having added the suffixes $-a$ and $-t i$ to a verbal base such as $p a c$, meaning "to cook".
(6) Kitaka refers to the rules for producing a noun by adding a suffix to a verbal base and joining the two together. For instance, according to the rules, the noun buddha is formed when the suffix -ta is added after the verbal base budh and the two are joined together.
(7) Kāraka refers to the section that explains the grammatical meanings of subject and object, etc., the rules of employing cases in different categories of meanings, and the distinction between subject (active voice)
and object (passive voice) and the respective cases to be used in that context.

Just as the Sanskrit language has many grammars, such as Pāṇini, Cāndra, Kā-tantra, Mugdha-bodha, and the Sārasvata, the Pali language has three principal grammars, namely, the Kaccāyana, Moggallāna, and the Sadda-nīti. Of those, there are grammatical works written for the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa, such as the Kaccāyana-[vutti], Rūpa-siddhi, Bālāvatāra, Mahā-nirutti, Cūḷa-nirutti, and Nirutti-pitaka. For the Moggallānavyākaraṇa there are works such as the Moggallāna-vutti, Payoga-siddhi, Susadda-siddhi, and Pada-sādhana. For the Sadda-nīti-vyākaraṇa there is only the Cūḷa-saddanīti.

In addition to the threefold division of grammatical literature mentioned, all grammatical literature is principally of two types. These two types are as follows: (I) texts [consisting of sütras (aphoristic rules)] that teach the procedure for the derivation of words and (2) texts [without sütras] that teach a particular feature of grammar. Those texts that teach the procedure for the derivation of words include texts that have been already mentioned here, such as the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa and its Sinhala glosses (sannaya), commentaries, and sub-commentaries, etc.

The texts that teach the procedure of deriving words are also of two types, namely, those that prioritise the sütras and those that prioritise the grammatical examples. Those texts that prioritise the sütras take a sūtra as their basis and provide examples that can be formed from that sūtra. Examples of such texts are the three grammars, the Kaccāyana[-vutti], Moggallāna-vutti and the Cūḷa-sadda-nīti. In both Pali and Sanskrit, the main grammatical works are those that prioritise the sütras. The grammars that prioritise examples [p. 5] are texts that take a grammatical example as their basis and teach the sütras that are necessary to form the words of the example. Grammars such as these are the Rūpa-siddhi, Bālāvatāra, and Pada-sādhana, for instance.

The texts that teach a particular aspect of grammar include, for instance, the Sambandha-cintā, the Sadda-sārattha-jālinī, Kaccāyanabheda, Saddattha-bheda-cintā, Kārikā, Kārikā-vutti, Vibhaty-attha, Vācakopadesa, Naya-lakkhaṇa-vibhāvinī, Nirutti-saṅgaha, Kaccāyanasāra, Vibhaty-attha-dīpanī, Saṃvaṇṇanā-naya-dīpanī, Vācca-vācaka, Sadda-vutti, Bāla-ppabodhana, Kaccāyana-dīpanī, Gūḷhattha-dīpanī,
Mukha-matta-sāra, Sadda-bindu, Sadda-kalikā, Sadda-vinicchaya, and also their Sinhala glosses and their commentaries. Among the grammatical texts that have been mentioned here, some are difficult to find in Sri Lanka and a few are difficult to find in any country. As a result, some people do not know any information at all concerning some of these texts. Therefore, to introduce the aforementioned books for the benefit of novices I provide here some facts with respect to the date, general contents and authorship etc. of a large quantity of grammatical texts. Out of these, texts which teach the procedure for deriving words will be discussed first and, as Kaccāyana is the principal grammar of such texts, texts of this tradition will be dealt with first too.

# I. KACCĀYANA ${ }^{1}$ 

This text, which is also widely known in the country by the name Sandhi-kappa, is the oldest and one of the most useful grammars among all Pali grammatical texts (just as Pāṇini is to the Sanskrit grammatical tradition). There are Pali grammatical texts available, such as the Saddanīti, however, that are more useful than this. In the Pañcikā-pradīpaya, the text is identified by the name Kaccāyana-vutti.

It is known from other works that the Kaccāyana has several commentaries and, at present, there are extant four commentaries, two subcommentaries, a text on the syntax of sūtra-wording (padayojana), the separation (vigraha) of sūtra-wording, and two Sinhala glosses (sannaya). These commentaries are the Nyāsa, Sutta-niddesa, Kaccāyana-vaṇnanā, Sandhi-kappa-ṭ̄kā, and the Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā, etc. There is mention of the name Kaccāyana in the oldest texts and, according to other (more recent) texts, this work was composed at the time of the Buddha [p. 6]. There is also a very old Sanskrit work that bears this name too. ${ }^{1}$ Many of the procedures for the derivation of words that are not mentioned in the Kaccāyana are mentioned in the Rūpa-siddhi and Sadda-nīti. The Kaccāyana also contains many more sūtras and word derivations than the Bālāvatāra. This grammar has already been printed in countries such as England, Germany, and France. Also, a few chapters of the work have been published in Sinhala script and in English translation by the Advocate James D'Alwis.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See Franke 1902, 5-22; Pind 2012, 71-100.
It is mentioned in the texts that have been composed more recently that the author of the Kaccāyana was the venerable Mahā Kaccāyana Thera who lived at the time of the Buddha and who reached the highest position in the Sangha having attained the four supreme knowledges, but there is no mention of this in the Kaccāyana's two [oldest] commentaries. In addition, in the Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa critical views on certain sūtras of this grammar have been expressed. There are also some examples in the grammar that were composed more recently, such as $k v$ gato si tvaṃ devānaṃ-piyatissa ("Where are you going, Devānaṃpiyatissa?"). ${ }^{1}$ Hence, some scholars are doubtful whether Mahā Kaccāyana Thera was the author of this grammar. In the Aṅguttaranikāya commentary, however, it is stated that Mahā Kaccāyana Thera, as a result of a previous request, taught three works in the midst of the Sañgha, namely, the Kaccāyana, the Mahā-nirutti-ppakaraṇa and the Netti-ppakaraṇa: "Mahā-kaccāyana-tthero pubba-patthanā-vasena kaccā-yana-ppakaraṇaṃ mahā-nirutti-ppakaraṇaṃ netti-ppakaraṇañ cā ti pakaraṇa-ttayaṃ sañgha-majjhe pakāsesi." ${ }^{2}$

Some teachers think that only the sūtras were composed by Mahā Kaccāyana Thera and that the other two parts - the gloss (vrtti) and examples - were composed by Sañghanandi and Brahmadatta. In this regard, it is said:

The rules were composed by Kaccāyana, the gloss by Sañghanandi, the examples by Brahmadatta, and the explanation by Vimalabuddhi. ${ }^{3}$

The Kaccāyana-bheda-ṭikā, however, states that "the teachers, furthermore, say that Kaccāyana Thera composed this Kaccāyana-book, which consists of the rules, gloss, and examples" [p. 7]. ${ }^{4}$ The Sutta-niddesa states that the first sūtra in the Kaccāyana, attho akkharasaññāto

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ ad Kacc 227 kissa ka ve ca.
    ${ }^{2}$ This quotation appears to be from the Apadāna commentary (Ap-a $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{e}} 491$, Ap-a $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{e}} 2.213$ ) rather than the Aṅguttara-nikāya commentary.

    Kaccānena kato yogo vutti ca Saṃghanandinā | payogo Brahmadattena nyāso Vimalabuddhinā ||
    ${ }^{4}$ Kacc-bh-t (Nm 6): ācariyā pana lakkhaṇavuttiudāharaṇasaṃkhātaṃ imaṃ Kaccāyanagandhaṃ Kaccāyanattherena katan ti vadanti.
("meaning is understood from sounds"), which is known as the "introductory statement" (pürvavākya), was uttered by the illustrious mouth of Lord Buddha:

One monk who went forth when old, having taken a subject for meditation (kammatthāna) in the presence of the Buddha, began reciting the meditation subject $u d a b b a y a$ (arising and decaying) while he sat at the foot of a sāl tree on the shore of Anotatta. Upon seeing a heron walking in the water, he changed his meditation to udakabaka (water-heron). Perceiving this mistake, the Buddha summoned the monk who went forth wen old and uttered this statement: "meaning is understood from sounds" (athho akkharasaññāto). Understanding the intention of the Buddha, Mahā Kaccāyana Thera placed this statement at the beginning of the book he composed. Some also say that this sūtra was composed by Kaccāyana [himself]. ${ }^{1}$

It is difficult to be certain, however, and scholars should continue to ponder it since there is a slightly different telling of this account in the Kaccāyana-vaṇṇanā and there is also no mention of it in any commentarial teaching. In any case, we can be certain that the Kaccāyana is the first and oldest of all the Pali grammatical texts and that it is a precious text composed by a first class scholar that is very useful for understanding Pali grammar. ${ }^{2}$ The grammar has eight books or sections, namely sandhi, nāma, kāraka, samāsa, taddhita, ākhyāta, kitaka, and unādi. ${ }^{3}$ Sandhi has five chapters, nāma has five chapters, kāraka has one chapter, [p. 8] samāsa has one chapter, taddhita has one chapter, ākhyāta has four chapters, kitaka has five chapters, and unādi has one chapter. Thus, there are twenty-three chapters. There are seven hundred and ten

sūtras. There are one thousand and seven hundred verses with metrical feet of seven syllables each. In terms of the number of recitations (bhānavāra) ${ }^{1}$, there are fifty verses short of seven recitations. There are six thousand eight hundred metrical feet, and there are fifty-four thousand four hundred letters.

Just as there is a similarity between Kaccāyana sūtras and certain Pāṇinian sūtras, such as apādāne pañcamī, ${ }^{1}$ bhuvādayo dhātavah ${ }^{2}$ and kartari krt, ${ }^{3}$ there is an even greater similarity between the sūtras of the Kā-tantra-vyākaraṇa and the Kaccāyana.

Otherwise known as the Mukha-matta-dīpanī, this is an old commentary that was composed for the Kaccāyana by the venerable teacher Vimalabuddhi. ${ }^{4}$ In the Pañcikā, this text is also referred to as the Kaccāyanavutti-vaṇṇanā. Apart from the Mahā-nirutti, Purāṇa-cūḷa-nirutti, and Purāṇa-kārikā, since the Nyāsa's name is mentioned in a great majority of Pali grammars, such as the Sadda-sārattha-jālinī and Kaccāyanabheda, the Nyāsa must be older than these grammars. It also must be younger than the Cūḷa-nirutti since its name is mentioned in the Nyāsa. Apart from this, nothing is said at the end of the Nyāsa or in any other grammar to help ascertain a precise date for the work. In other works, the grammar is called the Mukha-matta-dīpanī, though there is reason to believe that there is another book by this name composed by another

teacher. ${ }^{1}$ The commentary is thirty recitations long and it is the longest commentary on the Kaccāyana. There is some doubt in the Sāsana-vaṃsa concerning whether the author of the work is from Sri Lanka or India. The commentarial method of the text is as described in the following verse:
[The method] for commenting on a sūtra is sixfold: (1) syntactic construction, (2) the word, (3) the meaning of the word, (4) the separation of words, (5) objections, and (6) their refutation. ${ }^{2}$

The Nyāsa not only comments on the sūtras but also explains in detail the procedures for deriving the words in all the examples given in the Kaccāyana alongside the sūtras. According to the method given in the verse, the sūtra "sarā sare lopam" (Kacc I2, "vowels before a vowel are to be elided") is commented upon as follows: [p. Io]
sarā sare lopam: for what purpose does he (Kaccāyana) say this? [He says this] for the purpose of eliding the preceding vowel, when there is a conjunction [of vowels]. sarà: this is one word; sare: this is one; lopam: this is one; this sūtra has three words. The meaning [of the sūtra] is that "vowels undergo elision before a vowel". And in this [sūtra], sarà is defined as the agent, sare is the cause, and lopam is the grammatical operation. "They shine" (saranti), therefore they are sarà. Elision (lutti) is lopo. He states this [sūtra] here because sandhi rules for vowels are to be given first, since it is vowels that are appointed first [in the syllabary]. And in this [sūtra], the mention of sare rather than saresu has the purpose of indicating that [the operation should occur] one [vowel] at a time. Yet, if this is the case, why does [the author] say sarà and not saro? [He says sarà] for the purpose of indicating that the elision of one, two, or four vowels also occurs [simultaneously]. For instance, in [the sūtra] sakhäto gass' e vā (Kacc 113, "Optionally, $a, \bar{a}, i, i$, and $e$ replace $g a$ [voc. sg.] after the word sakhā 'friend'"), $e$ has been separated into $a, \bar{a}, i, i$, and $e$ and is understood to be a dvanda compound, in keeping with the governing rule nāmānaṃ samāso yuttattho (Kacc 318, A compound of words has a unified sense) and nāmānaṃ samuccayo dvando (Kacc 331, "An aggregation of words is a dvanda compound"); and [as a dvanda] there

is no need to use the word $c a$ since "one does not use [speech forms] whose object (ṭhāna) has already been denoted". One should understand that in the case of $a, \bar{a}, i, \bar{i}$, and $e$, there is the elision of the other vowels due to the following $e$ sound.... All the sūtras in this chapter are operational (kāraka) sūtras. ${ }^{1}$
Furthermore, there are criticisms in the Rūpa-siddhi-ṭikā concerning some of the statements in the Nyāsa here that will be discussed later on. The opening verses of the Nyāsa are as follows:

Paying homage to the pure Buddha, the bringer of purity for the impure masses, to his well-spoken Dhamma, which destroys the delusions of utterly deluded people, to the Saṁgha, which is taintless and the highest object of offerings, and to Kaccāyana, whose intelligence was praised by the Sage, I who know the judgements and resolutions that are supported by the lineage will compose a mere introduction (mukha-matta) to the KACCĀYANA written by him by relying upon the teachings that have been handed down. ${ }^{2}$

# 3. NIRUTTI-SĀRA-MAŠIĪSĀ ${ }^{1}$ 

This is the second commentary on the Nyāsa as there is a commentary composed before it called the Nyāsa-ppadīpa. Even though it is the second commentary, it can be considered the principal commentary in terms of its usefulness and its size. Since it is a commentary ( $t i k \bar{a}$ ) on a commentary, it is a sub-commentary (anuțikā). It was composed by the venerable elder Dāṭhānāgarājaguru during the reign of Sirinandapavarādhipati, in the city of Ratanāpura ${ }^{2}$ in the country of Tambadīpa in Burma. Its date appears to be later than the Vācakopadesa, Ekakkharakosa, its commentary, the Sadda-vutti, its commentary, [p. I I] the Sadda-sāra-jālinī, the Rūpa-siddhi, the Rūpa-siddhi-ṭikā, the Sadda-nīti, the Sutta-niddesa, and the Maṇi-sāra-mañjūsā, etc., as it quotes examples from these works. There is no larger work than this among all the commentaries that were composed for Pali grammatical texts. In some other texts this work is called the Nirutti-mañjūsā, though there is also a commentary on the Purāṇa-cūḷa-nirutti called the Nirutti-mañjūsā or simply the Mañjūsā.

In the commentaries the word buddha is analysed as bujjhitā saccān $\bar{\imath}$ ti buddho ("Buddha: the one who realises truths"). This commentary states, however, that this analysis is an error:

In the expression loke avagantā ("they descend into the world"), one should understand the word avagata as having the [syntactic-]sense of pure agent. ${ }^{3}$ Likewise, in the expression bujjhitā saccānaṃ ("the realiser of truths"), one should understand the word buddho as having the [syntactic-]sense of pure agent too. It is in this [sense], then, that they write bujjhitā saccāni in the texts. This is inelegant, however, and a better reading would be bujjhitā saccānaṃ ("the realiser of truths"), since (I) there is the statement that $y u-n v \bar{u}-t u$-paccayantasmiṃ chaṭthi bhavati kammani (the sixth case occurs in the sense of the grammatical object in connection with [a word] with the suffix $y u, n v \bar{u}$ or $t u$ ), (2) the sixth case plural suffix occurs in the sense of the grammatical object in connection with the suffix -tu of the word bujjhitā according to the

Furthermore, its commentary on the Nyāsa's explanation of the sūtra "sarā sare lopam" is as follows:

Now, after this, he (the author of the NYĀSA) begins "sarā sare lopam: for what purpose is this said?" in order to provide a commentary on this operational rule prescribing an elision. For an operational rule (vidhi-sutta) is eightfold, namely, [the operation of] elision (lopa), substitution (ādesa), lengthening (dīgha), shortening (rassa), suffixation (paccaya), case-suffixation (vibhatti), augmentation (āgama), and prohibition (paṭisedha). Furthermore, it is said:
There are eight types of operation: elision (lopa), substitution (ādesa), lengthening (dīgha), shortening (rassa), suffixation (paccaya), caseending suffixation (vibhatti), augmentation (āgama), and prohibition (paṭisedha).
When there is a conjunction [of vowels]: When there is no intervening sound between two vowels, which are the cause and agent [of the grammatical operation]. Lopo: the verbal base lup in the sense of nonperception [is joined with the suffix] na. He (the author of the NYĀSA) does not say that there should be an agreement between singular suffixes, such as saro sare lopam, or between plural suffixes, such as sarā saresu lopam, nor does he believe that there is a contradiction in case-endings between the cause and the agent [of the grammatical operation]. In this respect, with the [statement] beginning saresu he shows that such proscriptive criticisms (codanā) are without utility and [p. I2] refutes them. Saresu: Here, [the meaning is] "when the vowels, which are the cause [of the grammatical operation] ...". It is in the locative case in the sense of cause, in keeping with the sūtra kammakarananimittatthesu sattamī (Kacc 312, The seventh case [occurs] in the sense of object, instrument, and cause). For instance, nāgo dantesu haññate ("the elephant is killed for the sake of its tusks"), etc. In order to give an example of the simultaneous elision also of many vowels

before a vowel, which is the cause [of the grammatical operation], he (the author of the NYĀSA) makes the statement beginning "tena sakhāto...". In the RūPA-SIDDHI, however, [its author] believes that vowels are elided one at a time when followed by each single vowel and that they are not elided simultaneously when followed by a single vowel. In this connection, therefore, [the author of the NYĀSA] states that, furthermore, [sarā] is plural [in this sūtra] in order to indicate the elision of many [vowels] when preceding a single vowel. The commentary on the RŪPA-SIDDHI also states that:
the use of the plural [in the word] sarà has the purpose of indicating the plurality of [vowels] so that there is also the elision of all [word-]final vowels, beginning with $a$, when followed by each single vowel. One should not accept the statement in the NYĀSA that "[Kaccāyana says sarà] for the purpose of indicating that the elision of one, two, or four vowels also occurs [simultaneously]", since such a usage is not found in the discourses of the Conqueror (jinavacana). There is no point in simultaneous elision, even in the sūtra sakhāto gass' e vā (Kacc I13), since the four vowels, $a$, etc., are elided in each separate word before the $e$ sound. ${ }^{1}$ For it is said: sabhāvassāpi e ti nipātanato sijjhanato ("The nature of the $e$ [sound] is established as a ready-made form [?]").
The SADDA-NĪTI, however, agrees with the opinion of the NYĀSA [and states that]
there is the simultaneous elision of two preceding vowels followed by a single vowel in [the sentence] nānādisam yanti, dīsā bhanti ("They go to the various directions; they light up the directions"). There is also the simultaneous elision of three preceding vowels followed by a single vowel [in the sentence] na mum puna upeyyāsi ajjheyyāsi (Ja IV 24I, "visit/approach me no more!") ... In the [word] yanti, the arrangement of sounds [prior to sandhi] was $y \bar{a}+$ $a+$ anti, with three vowels in succession. [In the word] upeyyāsi, the arrangement of sounds [prior to sandhi] was upa $+i+a+$ eyyāsi, with four vowels in succession. There is also a verse on this topic:

Vowels, whether one, two or even three, are elided before a vowel. The wise should learn this statement concerning sandhis

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The point here is that the Rūpa-siddhi-ṭīkā considers the four vowels that comprise the compound $e$ as separate words, as padas, and not as components of a single word. This would be the case if $e$ here is to be understood as a dvandva compound as previously stated in the Nyāsa. In this case, their sandhis should occur separately and not simultaneously.

In this [verse], n'asi rājabhaṭo ("Are you a government officer?") is an example where there is the elision of a single vowel. After that, [the others] are examples where there is the elision of two or three vowels, and one should learn the derivation of their forms.

Furthermore, as well as commenting on passages in the Nyāsa, this work also makes some important statements in places concerning the meaning of sections of the root text, that is, the Kaccāyana. There is also mention of some errors in the older commentary too. In this regard, the Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā states the following concerning the gloss (vrtti) on the sūtra "byañjano ca visaññogo" (Kacc 4I, "a conjunct consonant becomes a single consonant when a vowel is elided after a niggahīta"):

And in [the sūtra's] gloss (vrtti) there are two different readings:
(1) "The mention of $c a$ ('and') serves [to indicate] that there is also the elision of those [consonants] that are homogeneous among (tesam) a [conjunct] of three consonants" and (2) "The mention of $c a$ ('and') serves [to indicate] that there is sometimes also the elision of a [conjunct] of three homogeneous consonants (tinnam pi byañjanānam sarūpānaṃ)". Out of those [two], the first reading is the older reading and the second reading is the more recent reading. [Scholars] nowadays follow this [latter] reading. This is a commentary on the first reading of the [two]: "There should be the elision of the first of the [consonants] that are homogeneous in a [conjunct] of three consonants, when there follows a single vowel in disrupting proximity (byavadhāyaka)." In this [commentary], tesaṃ has the sense of a locative of specification (niddhārana). Furthermore, this is a commentary on the second reading: "tinṇaṃ is an adjective, byañjanānaṃ has the sense of a locative of specification, and this is to be construed with [the word] sarūpānaṃ. Sometimes the word [ca] has the purpose of [introducing] an alternative opinion (vikappana). [The author] shows, therefore, that there is the elision of a single homogeneous sound only in a [conjunct] of three consonants, consisting of a conjunct of two homogeneous sounds and one heterogeneous sound. There is not to be any elision in a conjunct of three heterogeneous sounds." ${ }^{1}$

[The commentary] also states that with respect to the word pañcaddasī ("having fifteen"), which had recently come into use as an example for the sūtra "paradve bhāvo ḥāne" (Kacc 28, "After a vowel there is the reduplication of a consonant in the appropriate situaton"), that the reduplication of the letter $d$ in dasa (ten) should not occur after any number except catu (four) and cha (six).
The opening verses of the Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā are as follows:
I pay homage to the Buddha, a source of pure compassion from whom the sacred texts are obtained; to the Dhamma, which destroys the darkness of delusion and bestows deathlessness; to the highest community, which is the epitome of perfect purity, a refuge for the three worlds, and the best object of offerings; [p. I4] and to Kaccāyana, whose intelligence was praised by the Sage, who opened the ancient path to analytical knowledge, and who was beautiful to behold, possessing a golden and even complexion. That commentary on the NYĀSA that was composed by the best teachers has not improved monks' understanding and, thus, I will compose a commentary to increase [their] understanding. ${ }^{1}$

# 4. NYĀSA-PPADĪPA ${ }^{2}$ 

This is the first commentary on the Nyāsa. It was composed by a certain minister during the reign of King Narapati of Arimaddana (i.e. slightly before the Buddhist year 1725). ${ }^{3}$ It is said in the Sāsana-vaṃsa that having discerned that (the author of the Nyāsa-ppadīpa) had fallen in love with a young princess who was born in the king's harem, the king declared that if he wrote a book that was comprehensive in its judgements and profound in meaning he would give the princess to him. On the completion of the Nyāsa commentary, the king gave him his daughter and also appointed him to the ministerial position of land revenue surveyor (rajjuggâha). Since the name of this minister was "Saṃkhyaṃ", ${ }^{4}$ the Nyāsa commentary is also known by this name in Burma.

Even though the Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā [p. 15] has little good to say about the commentary, it is concise, and so it is not a burden on the root text. The Nirutti-sāra-mañjūsā criticises this commentary in many places. The opening verses of the Nyāsa-ppadīpa are as follows:

Paying homage to the Buddha - who is the end of the journey for those in cyclic existence, a source of virtue, unobstructable, one who has fathomed what is knowable, and who is the protector of those who lack protection - to the Dhamma and the highest Sañgha, resolute I

# 5. SUTTA-NIDDESA ${ }^{2}$ 

This is a commentary on the Kaccāyana. It was composed by a venerable elder named Chapaṭa (or Chapada) who lived in Burma in around the Buddhist year $1725^{3}$ (that is about seven hundred years ago). How is this date determined? King Parākramabāhu I (with the assistance of the venerable Diñbulāgala Mahākassapa Thera) unified the nikāyas and purified the sāsana in the Buddhist year $1709,{ }^{4}$ that is in the eighteenth year of the king's reign. The venerable Chapaṭa Thera came to Lanka as a young sāmaṇera six years before the reforms along with his teacher the venerable Uttarājīva Thera. It is possible that he composed the Suttaniddesa in Sri Lanka since he returned to his own country, wielding knowledge in both the sciences (śāstras) and Buddhist teachings (āgamas) after taking higher ordination in Sri Lanka and staying there for ten years. Although, if King Parākramabāhu I came to the throne in the Buddhist year $1587,{ }^{5, \text { vi }}$ as it is recorded in the Saddhamma-saṅgaha, then the Sutta-niddesa must have been composed more than seven hundred years ago. The Kalyāṇi-ppakaraṇa states, however, that "King

    ${ }^{2}$ Subhūti's discussion here about the date of the Sutta-niddesa is incorrect. His error is based on identifying Chapaṭa, author of the Sutta-niddesa, with a certain Chapaṭa who is mentioned in the Kalyāṇī inscription as bringing Lankan Buddhism to Burma during the reign of Parākramabāhu I. Franke (1902, 23) also makes the same error and, like Subhūti, dates the work to 1182. Aleix Ruiz-Falqués (2015) has provided the most recent and exhaustive discussion of the date of the Sutta-niddesa and dates Chapaṭa's trip to Sri Lanka, and thus also the approximate date of the authorship of his grammar, to the Buddhist year 1990, that is, I445/46 CE. The first scholars to date Chapaṭa to the fifteenth-century were Buddhadatta (1957) and Godakumbura (1969).

Parākramabāhu came to reign in the Buddhist year I709". ${ }^{1}$ There is also the following statement in the Vinaya-sannaya that was written at that time by Dinhbulāgala Medhaṅkara Mahā Thera:

The great king Parākramabāhu, having taken into his control the Buddhist religion that had been split since the 456th year of the Buddha's parinibhāna and that had further remained for 1256 years, removed the putrid parts of the impure fraternities, namely, of the Jetavana and Abhayagiri, [p. I6] upheld the pure theravāda of the residents of the Mahāvihāra, and purified and united the pure Saṅgha. ${ }^{2}$

Since this statement agrees with the Kalyāni-ppakaraṇa and since this date is close to that calculated by James D'Alwis from the Mahā-vaṃsa, there should be greater confidence in the date given in the Kalyāni-ppakaraṇa than the date given in the Saddhamma-saṅgaha. It seems, therefore, that the composition of the Sutta-niddesa must not have occurred less than five hundred and ninety years ago.

Not only was the Sutta-niddesa composed by the venerable Chapaṭa Thera, but he also composed works on the abhidhamma, namely, the Saṅkhepa-vaṇnanā, which is a commentary on the Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha, and the Nāma-cāra-dīpa, and on the vinaya, namely, the Vinaya-gu]hattha-dīpanī and the Sīmālañkāra-ṭ̄̄kā.

At the beginning and conclusion of the Sutta-niddesa, the elder remembers Sri Lanka with a statement of gratitude. Even in the benedictory verses, after praising the virtues of Lord Buddha, he mentions that the Buddha visited Sri Lanka three times and established the religion there. The Kalyāni-ppakaraṇa states that this elder, Chapaṭa, had memorised the tipitaka and that, when he was young, he came to Sri Lanka

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Subhūti actually writes here that "the Kalyāni-ppakaraṇa states, however, that King Parākramabāhu came to reign in the Buddhist year I79I". We have treated this date as a printing or typographical error, since he asserted earlier that Parākramabāhu's reforms took place in I709 and since the Kalyāni inscription actually dates the accession of the king to the year 526 of the Burmese era, that is, to the Buddhist year I709 (see Taw Sein Ko I892, p. 50).
    2 Vinayārtha-samuccaya (Nm I5-I6): budun pitinivī sārasiya supanas havuruddak tubū budu sasna parākramabāhu maharajānan ārageṇa denānakā bagirinakā yana asuddha denakayehi vipanna tān hāra mahā vihāra vāsīvū parisuddhavū theravādayama geṇa pavatnā pirisindu tān hā suddha saṃghayā samaga koṭa.
from Burma and, after learning the sciences (sāstras) and Buddhist teachings (āgamas), he obtained the recognition of "elder" (thera) and achieved the status of being "one who has memorised the tipitaka" (tipitaka-dhara). He then went to Burma with four other elders from that country and established and developed a new fraternity there. I believe it is possible that some of his works were composed in Sri Lanka. The opening verses of the Sañkhepa-vaṇnanā are as follows:

On the invitation of Mahāvijayabāhu who crouched [in supplication], who possesses knowledge of the traditional religion and sciences, who is renowned on this island like a full moon in an autumn sky, and who desires the prosperity of the religion, I will compose the SaNKHEPAPADA-VANNANA. ${ }^{1}$

Since "Vijayabāhu" is a Sri Lankan name, it is possible that the Sañkhepavaṇnanā was composed in this country. In some of his works, this monk also states that his work is sīhaladesiya-paradesiyānam atthāya ("for the benefit of those living in Sihala country and those living in other countries") [p. 17]. Since, in Sri Lanka, people from foreign countries are known as "paradeš", it is possible that these works were written in Sri Lanka. The Sutta-niddesa, however, does not contain such a statement and, therefore, there is reason to think that it was composed in Burma. For the most part, only the sütras of the Kaccāyana are commented upon. In some places, however, there are very detailed statements about the gloss (vrtti) and the examples. The Sutta-niddesa's method for commenting on the sütras is as follows:
[The method] for commenting on a sūtra is sixfold: (1) syntactic construction, (2) the word, (3) the meaning of the word, (4) the separation of words, (5) objections and (6) their refutation. ${ }^{2}$
In addition to commenting on each sūtra with this sixfold method, the

author also explains fully the examples for the sūtras that were not well explained in earlier commentaries such as the Nyāsa. The Sutta-niddesa also explains statements taken from other grammatical works such as the Bālāvatāra, the Rūpa-siddhi, the Nyāsa, the Nyāsa-ppadīpa, the Kārikā, the Akkhara-mañjūsā, and the Cāndra-vyākaraṇa. The opening verses of the Sutta-niddesa are as follows: ${ }^{1}$

I bow down to the Lord of the World, who visited Sri Lanka three times and established the religion (sāsana), to the Dhamma and to the highest community. Upon the request of Dhammacāri, who seeks the preservation of the good Dhamma, I will write a commentary on Kaccāyana's sūtras, which incorporates an explanation [of the syntactic function of the words in every rule] (niddesa). ${ }^{2}$
The Sutta-niddesa's commentary on the sūtra "sarā sare lopam" is as follows:
sarā: this is one word; sare: this is one; lopam: this is one. According to the division of words on the basis of their case ending, one should understand that this sūtra has three words. sarā is defined as the agent, sare is defined as the cause, and lopam is defined as the grammatical operation. Out of the [different types of] sūtra, namely, (1) a rule defining a technical term (saññā-[sutta]), (2) a meta-rule (paribhāsā-[sutta]), (3) an operational rule (vidhi-[sutta]), (4) a rule prescribing a restriction (niyama-[sutta]), and (5) a rule of prohibition (paṭisedha-[sutta]), one should understand this to be an operational rule (vidhi-sutta).

There could be an objection in connection [with this sūtra], namely, that, if sarā (vowels) is plural, should not [Kaccāyana] say saresu (before vowels) [rather than sare (before a vowel)]? No, because each single vowel is the cause [of the grammatical operation]. If this is the case, then, should not [Kaccāyana] say savo (a vowel) since only a single vowel undergoes elision? No, because there is also

Alternatively, [Kaccāyana] says sarā in order to indicate that, before each vowel, all eight vowels, whether homogeneous or not homogeneous, can undergo elision [p. I8]. It is said in the gloss (vati), for instance, that "also all vowels obtain elision when a vowel follows (pare)". How does one understand that the word pare ("follows") in this [statement] is expressed by the general [formulation] sarā sare? It is understood as [the sense of pare] is expressed by the seventh case of [the word] sare denoting a cause. Alternatively, it is understood [in this sūtra] as [the word] paro was given as the agent of the previous sūtra. ${ }^{1}$

# 6. KACCĀYANA-VASṠANĀ ${ }^{2}$ 

This is a third commentary composed for the Kaccāyana. The author of this work was Mahāvijitāvī Mahā Thera who resided on Abhayagiripabbata close to Vijayapura in the province of Tambadīpa in Burma. Its date of composition is later than the Sutta-niddesa, Rūpa-siddhi, Rūpa-siddhi-ṭ̄kā and Sadda-nīti. Examples are taken from these works and also from the Nirutti-ppakaraṇa, the Kaccāyana-nissaya-ppakaraṇa, the Kārikā [p. 19], and Nyāsa. Also, an important commentarial method not used in the other commentaries, such as the Nyāsa and Sutta-niddesa, is applied to all the sūtras, that is, the Kaccāyana-vaṇnanā explains the arrangement of all the sūtras of the Kaccāyana by elucidating the rationale behind them, having posed the questions idaṃ suttam kim pabhavam kim nidānaṃ kuto nikkhantaṃ ("What is the origin of this sūtra? What is its cause? From what does it proceed?"). It explains, for instance, that the sūtra tatth' odantā sarā attha (Kacc 3, "among [the sounds] there are eight vowels ending in $o$ ") derives from the sūtra akkharā $p^{\prime}$ ādayo

ekacattālīsaṃ (Kacc 2, "there are forty-one sounds beginning with ' $a$ '"). The opening verses of the Kaccāyana-vaṇnanā are as follows:

I pay homage to the Conqueror, who brought about the purification of impure people, to the Dhamma that destroys delusion, to the taintless Sañgha, which was established as the highest with the [Buddha's declaration that] "this is the highest...", to the Mahā Thera who was the author of the NYĀSA, to the teacher Buddhappiya who composed the RUPA-SIDDHI, to the three highest scholars (aggapandita) who composed the SADDA-NĪTI, to the author of the nissaya, and to the author of the [KACCĀYANA-SUTTA]-NIDDESA. It is by relying on their well-considered judgements that I will compose the KACCĀYANA-VANṢANĀ for the benefit of monks and novices. ${ }^{1}$
The Kaccāyana-vaṇṇanā's commentary on the sūtra "sarā sare lopam" is as follows:
sarā sare lopam (Kacc I2): What is the origin of this sūtra? What is its cause? From what does it proceed? The sūtra originates in connection with the sūtras pubbam adhoṭhitam assaraṃ sarena viyojaye (Kacc Io, "One should separate a preceding, final consonant from its [inherent] vowel") and naye paraṃ yuttaṃ (Kacc I I, "One should join it with what follows"). These [sūtras] are its cause and it is from these [sūtras] that it (i.e. Kacc I2) proceeds. With respect to [the example] yass' indriyāni ("He whose sense-organs ..."), for instance, [Kaccāyana] uttered the sūtra sarā sare lopam to show that, prior to sandhi, i.e. yassa + indriyāni, having separated the consonant from the vowel in accordance with pubbam adhoṭhitam assaraṃ sarena viyojaye (Kacc Io), one should elide the preceding vowel when another vowel follows before joining [that consonant] with the following sound.

Why does [Kaccāyana] utter this [sūtra]? [He utters this sūtra] in order to indicate that there is to be the elision of preceding vowels before another vowel. sarā: this is one word; sare: this is one; lopam: this is one. This [sūtra] has three words. sarā is defined as the

agent, sare is defined as the cause, and lopam is defined as the grammatical operation. Out of the [different types of] sūtra, namely, (I) a rule defining a technical term (saññā-[sutta]), (2) a meta-rule (paribhāsā-[sutta]), (3) an operational rule (vidhi-[sutta]), (4) a rule prescribing a restriction (niyama-[sutta]), and (5) a rule of prohibition (patisedha-[sutta]), one should understand this to be an operational rule (vidhi-sutta).

There are eight types of operation: elision (lopa), substitution (ādesa), lengthening (dīgha), shortening (rassa), suffixation (paccaya), case-ending suffixation (vibhatti), augmentation (āgama), and prohibition (pațisedha).

Among the aforementioned types of operation, [this sūtra] should be understood as an operation of elision.

The wise man illumines the four types of operation: (I) an operation applicable to a preceding element (pubbavidhi), (2) an operation applicable to a following element (paravidhi), (3) an operation applicable to an earlier element [in a word-form] (antarañgavidhi), and (4) an operation applicable to a later element [in a word-form] (bāhirañgavidhi) [p. 20]. ${ }^{1}$

Among the aforementioned types of operation, [this sūtra] should be understood as an operation applicable to a preceding element (pubbavidhi). The meaning [of the sūtra] is that "vowels undergo elision before a vowel". "They shine" (saranti), therefore they are sarà. The eight vowels can be the agents [of the grammatical operation] and, likewise, they can be the cause [of the grammatical operation]. Before a vowel, there is lopa, that is, elision (loppana). It is said that, on account of the sandhi between words, nothing is perceived between the words at the time of speaking.

Why is there the mention of sare rather than saresu? It has the purpose of indicating that the elision of many vowels can occur when followed by a single vowel in each instance. The SADDA-NĪTI states that,
in this connection, in [the sentence] n'asi vājabhaṭo ("Are you a government officer?") there is the elision of a single vowel when followed by a single vowel. The division [of words prior to sandhi] was $n a+$ asi. In [the word] yanti ("they go"), there was the simultaneous elision of two vowels. The division [of sounds prior to sandhi] was $y \bar{a}+a$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ For a more detailed account of antarañga- and bāhirañga-vidhīs, see Abhyankar \& Shukla 1986, 28-29.
+ anti. There were three vowels, namely, the $\bar{a}$-sound component of the verbal base $y \bar{a}$, the $a$-suffix that comes after the $\bar{a}$ of the verbal base, and the $a$-sound that occurs at the beginning of the suffix -anti. Before the $a$ sound at the beginning of the suffix -anti there was the simultaneous elision of the two preceding sounds. In [the word] upeyya, there was the simultaneous elision of three vowels. The division [of sounds prior to sandhi] was upa $+i+a+$ eyya. The word upa is a prefix, $i$ is a verbal base, the sound $a$ is a suffix, and eyya is a [verbal] ending. In [this example], there are four vowels. Therefore, [with respect to this example] there was the simultaneous elision of the $a$ sound in upa, the $i$ sound of the verbal base, and the $a$ sound of the suffix.
In the NYĀSA, furthermore, a simultaneous elision of four [vowels] is mentioned before a single vowel in the case of $a, \bar{a}, i, \bar{i}$, and $e$ in the sūtra sakhāto gass' e vā (Kacc 113, Optionally, $a, \bar{a}, i, \bar{i}$, and $e$ replace ga [voc. sg.] after the word sakhā "friend"). One should consider the aforementioned examples in the SADDA-Nī̄ specifically under the rules for vowel elision [in the derivation of verbs], beginning lopañ c' ettam akāro (Sadd 1023; Kacc 512, "The suffix - $a$ is elided or it becomes - $e$ ").

The RŪPA-SIDDHI states, however, that "furthermore, in this [sūtra], the plural [of sarā] has the purpose of indicating the elision of many [vowels] before each single vowel." And in connection [with the example] sakhāto gass' e vā (Kacc 113), the [RŪPA-SIDDHI] states that "in the case of $a, \bar{a}, i, \bar{i}$, and $e$ there is the sequential (kamena) elision of the four vowels" [Rūp $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{R}} 37$ ].

The commentary on the RŪPA-SIDDHI also states that
[Kaccāyana] says sarā and not saro sare as the use of the plural [in the word] sarā has the purpose of indicating the plurality of [vowels] so that there is also the elision of all [word-[final [vowels], beginning with $a$, when followed by each single vowel.

And it is also said that there are eight simple [vowels] that can be the cause [of the grammatical operation] but there are many sounds (sara) - numbering sixty-four - that can be subject to the cause [of the operation]. Thus, the plural sarā is mentioned. [The SADDA-BINDU (v. 3)] states [for instance] that there are sixty-four vowels: "Sixty-four ( $v \bar{a} c \bar{c} \bar{i}$ ) sounds/vowels (sara) can be elided before [other] sounds, and fifty-two (rama) sounds can be elided following [other] sounds."

The reasoning that is given in the NYĀSA should also be rejected since such a usage is not found in the discourses of
the Conqueror (jinavacana) [p. 2I]. ${ }^{1}$

In the city named Vijaya, which is like a banner raised up from Lanka, there is Abhayagiri mountain, which is renowned in all quarters and is surrounded by cave-dwellings, such as the Nandamūla, ritual boundaries, rivers, mountains, ponds and fields. The grandson of the monk, Pañcasetibha, chief of Haṃsāvatipura, who was well known by the name Suruccanā, dwelt here in this pleasant place that is like [the mountain] Devasabhā.

This is the most useful and comprehensive of the works belonging to the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa that teach the procedure for the derivation of words (padasiddhikrama).

despite the fact he was the head of a number of monasteries in Cola country. It is not possible to give a precise date to the work, although we can say that it is earlier than the Sutta-niddesa, the Kaccāyana-vaṇnanā, the Kaccāyana-bheda, and Payoga-siddhi; later than the Cūla-nirutti-ṭikā and Nyāsa; and that at the time a pure Buddhism was still in existence in Cola country. The Rūpa-siddhi is to the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa what the Mahā-siddhānta-kaumudī is to the Pāṇini-vyākaraṇa (that is, the Aṣṭādhyāyī) and the Payoga-siddhi is to the Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa. It is possible that this work was composed later than the Moggallāna-vutti and Saddanīti as it is not mentioned by either. ${ }^{1}$ This work contains all the sūtras of the Kaccāyana, though it contains a great many procedures for word derivation not mentioned in either the Kaccāyana or Bālāvatāra.

In this work, new conditions have been added to complete certain statements in the Kaccāyana but such additions have been criticized by the author of the Payoga-siddhi. It is said in both the Kaccāyana and Bālāvatāra, for instance, that normally when there has been the elision of any preceding vowel, it is possible for a non-homogeneous (asavarna) substitute to replace the following vowel [p. 22]. In the Rūpa-siddhi, it is said that there is a non-homogeneous substitute only when the sound " $a$ " is elided: avanne eva lutte idha vuttavidhi hotīti datthabbaṃ ("One should understand that the operation mentioned here only occurs when there has been the elision of the sound ' $a$ '"). The Payoga-siddhi, however, rejects the interpretation that it is only when the sound " $a$ " is elided: avanne lutte e o honti gāhanisedhanattham... ("For the purpose of prohibiting the understanding that there are [substitutes] $e$ and $o$ [only] when there has been the elision of the sound ' $a$ ' ..."). Many statements included in the Rūpa-siddhi have also been articulated by the Mahā-siddhānta-kaumudī. The chapter on $\bar{a} k h y \bar{a} t a$ or verbal conjugation in the work is highly useful. The Nāma-varanāgilla, a work on nominal declension that is used nowadays, has also been compiled from the Rūpasiddhi. The Rūpa-siddhi also uses mnemonic verses as examples taken

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ While the Rūpa-siddhi is not mentioned in the Moggallāna-vutti, it is a source for the Moggallāna-pañcikā and its date is therefore earlier than that of the Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa (c. twelfth century). In this regard, see Gornall 20I4, 520-2I. Franke (1902-1903, I2 I) makes the same error as Subhūti and dates the Rūpa-siddhi after the Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa.
from the Cūḷa-nirutti-tīkā. As with the Kaccāyana, there are eight chapters in the work. The size of the work is more than seventeen recitations (bhānavāra) long. The Russian scholar named Minayeff who translated and published the Pāṭimokkha has now translated this work into his language (Russian) and is trying to get it published too.

There are a commentary and two Sinhala glosses (sannaya) for this work. ${ }^{1}$ It appears that the commentary (no. 8) was composed later than the Sadda-nīti and yet earlier than the Nirutti-mañjūsā. The commentary has also quoted statements from the Nyāsa, Sandhi-nirutti-ppakaraṇa, and the Mahā-sandhi-ppakaraṇa and has raised objections to some of the statements in the Nyāsa. The commentary states, for instance, that one should not accept the statement in the Nyāsa that the plural of sarā in "sarā sare lopam" (Kacc I2) has the purpose of eliding several vowels simultaneously: yaṃ pana nyāse vuttaṃ ekasmiṃ sare dviticatunnam pi lopo hotīti ñāpanatthan ti taṃ na gahetabbaṃ tādisassa payogassa jinavacane adassanato ... ("One should not accept the statement in the Nyāsa that '[Kaccāyana says sarā] for the purpose of indicating that the elision of two, three, or four vowels also occurs [simultaneously]', since such a usage is not found in the discourses of the Conqueror"). It is not said in what country or by whom the commentary was composed and there are no benedictory verses at the beginning. ${ }^{\text {sii }}$

The Sinhala gloss (sannaya) named Sandeha-vighātanī (no. 9) is the largest of the two Sinhala glosses but the copy that survives in the country at present only goes up to the kāraka chapter. Although the work is incomplete, the section that is available is more useful than the other sannaya and is larger than it too. The Sandeha-vighātanī explains the meaning of words and also in many places it provides an analysis of the words and the ideas behind them. In some places, it quotes from Pāṇini and the Saddattha-cintā [p. 23]. It is not possible to know at what time or by whom it was composed, though it can be ascertained that it was written after the other complete sannaya.

The complete sannaya (no. Io) was composed no more recently than four hundred years ago since it is quoted in the Pañcikā-pradīpaya.

Although it is referred to as the "complete sannaya", as it continues until the final section, it does not explain the meaning of all the words in the Rūpa-siddhi in order and omits explanations of some of the words in the middle of sections. The size of the complete work is forty recitations. The opening statement in the older sannaya is as follows:

For the purpose of giving the five (items of information about the composition) ${ }^{1}$ such as its name, etc., at the beginning of the work, paying homage to the triple gem first, the venerable teacher Buddhappiya commences with two verses, the beginning of which is visuddhasaddharmma etc. ${ }^{2}$
The opening statement of the Sandeha-vighātanī is as follows:
In order to produce a work called the PADA-RūPA-SIDDHI so that the dim-witted who have accumulated much merit may understand grammar, he first pays homage to the teachers for the purpose of removing the various perils, such as retribution, anger and death, which stand as impediments for the successful completion of the work as desired and for the purpose of accruing benefits such as the insight of wisdom. Praise is given at the beginning since, by means of such praise, the special virtues of teachers are established and, by the practice of such special virtues, one's worthiness of praise is established, and, by one's worthiness of praise, the (practice) of praise spreads, and, due to wide-spread praise, one's duties will be fulfilled as desired. Therefore, paying homage first, [Buddhappiya] utters the verse visuddhadhamma etc. ${ }^{3}$

# 11. BĀLĀVATĀRA ${ }^{1}$ 

This is the smallest work for the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa that teaches the procedure for the derivation of words (padasiddhikrama). It is not as useful as the Kaccāyana and Rūpa-siddhi for the study of Pali grammar, since it was composed in an abridged form for ease of learning. Its kāraka section, however, is more useful and extensive than the kāraka chapters in all the other works. The work takes grammatical examples as its basis (rather than the sūtras) and, this being so, many of the sūtras of the Kaccāyana are not given as there is the inclusion of only those sūtras needed to form the examples. Included in the work, however, are many important and useful examples not given in the Kaccāyana. The Bālāvatāra has also quoted from the Saddattha-cintā of Ratnaśrījñāna verses such as addabbabhūtaṃ kattādi etc. ${ }^{2}$

The chapter on unādi suffixes given in the Kaccāyana is missing in this work. One's understanding of Pali grammar will be very limited if one only fully studies the Bālāvatāra and not the Kaccāyana, etc. This work has been used to study Pali grammar in Sri Lanka for a long time, though in Burma and Thailand it is the Kaccāyana that is used. This work has three sannayas, namely, the Liyana-sannaya, the Balanasannaya, and the Gaḍalādeṇi-sannaya, a commentary on difficult words (gātapadaya), and two other commentaries, though, of those, the commentary ${ }^{\text {siii }}$ that was composed in Burma is difficult to find. The Liyanasannaya (no. 12) is a translation into Sinhala by a venerable Thera, who was a student of the venerable Mahā Thera Saṅgharāja Saraṇankara, of the grammatical procedures given in the Bālāvatāra for deriving words and examples. Although there are a few mistakes in it, it is a very useful work for beginners. It begins as follows:

Paying homage three times to the Buddha, whose eyes are like open lotus flowers, I will compose the BĀLĀVATĀRA to aid the understanding of beginners.

This is the opening of the work. This commentary was composed so that the good people who wish to learn the other śāstras and who are possessed of faithful intellect and who are devoted to and desire the growth and prosperity of the Buddha's teaching may understand without effort the grammatical procedures for the derivation of the words, in (examples) such as lokaggo buddho, in the book called the BĀLĀVATĀRA [p. 25]. The composition of this commentary was undertaken in accordance with grammatical science, having examined the grammatical procedures for the derivation of words in the SANDHIKAPPA [i.e. Kaccāyana] and RūPA-SIDDHI etc., by a monk named Dhammajoti, a resident of the Okañdapola monastery and pupil of the lord of ascetics, known as Vāliviṭa Pinḍapātika Saraṇankara, who had risen to the position of satigharāja and who had thoroughly understood metrics, lexicography, grammar, Dhamma, and Vinaya, who possessed such virtues as moral behaviour, and who was renowned in his own country and abroad. ${ }^{1}$
The Balana-sannaya (no. 13) is a sannaya that explains the meaning of words in the Bālāvatāra. The Gaḍalādeṇi-sannaya (no. 14) is a precious sannaya composed by a venerable elder who lived in the Gaḍalādeṇi monastery, which explains the meaning of words (padārtha) and, in some places, the sense of the underlying ideas (bhāvārtha). It includes important facts from Sanskrit texts such as Pāṇini. It is also the most useful and important work among those texts that help us understand the Bālāvatāra. In the Burmese manuscripts it is said that the name of the author of the Bālāvatāra is Dhammakitti. Since the Kaccāyanasāra-ṭ̄̄kā, the Saddattha-bheda-cintā and the Sutta-niddesa (of the venerable

I suspect that this work is older than the Rūpa-siddhi, though there are no facts to prove it. It is said in the final verses that there are seven chapters in the Bālāvatāra, namely, (I) sandhi, which is a combination of sandhi and saññā (technical terms), (2) nāma (nominal declension), (3) samāsa (compounding), (4) taddhita (nominal derivatives), (5) ākhyāta (verbal conjugation), (6) kitaka (verbal derivatives), and (7) kāraka (semanticosyntactic relations), and that the work is more than four recitations (bhānavāra) long:

# 15. BĀLĀVATĀRA-ṬĪKĀ² 

The Bālāvatāra-ṭ̂kā was written in Sri Lanka but we do not know who wrote it. It is also not a very old work. It has quoted certain statements from the Nyāsa-ṭ̄kā, the Sadda-nīti, the Sutta-niddesa, the Kaccāyanabheda-ṭ̄kā, the Vinaya-vinicchaya-ṭ̂kā, and also from a grammatical work known as the Bījākhyā. The work's prose is not so elegant in some places. The author, though, has commented on both the words and the meanings and he has taken a lot of trouble to give extensive explanations of some of the sections of the work that he has understood clearly and to provide an analysis of the words in each sūtra. The size of the work is equivalent to the Bālāvatāra-sannaya, that is, not less than twenty-four recitations.

The commentary on the sūtra "nyattatā bhāve tu" (Kacc 362, "And the [suffixes] -nya, -tta, and -tā occur in the sense of 'condition'") is as follows:
ṇyattatā: this is one [word], bhāve: this is one, tu: this is one. According to the division of words on the basis of their case ending, this sūtra should be considered to have three words. Out of the [different types of] sūtra, namely, (I) a rule defining a technical term (saññā-[sutta]), (2) a meta-rule (paribhāsā-[sutta]), etc., one should understand this to be an operational rule (vidhi-sutta). bhāve tu: in the sense of "condition" (bhāva). ņyattatā: the meaning is "there is the suffix -Nya, the suffix -tta and the suffix -tā". In [the sūtra] the word tu has a conjunctive sense. bhāva is that due to which cognition (buddhi) and language (sadda) arise (bhavanti). Due to which: due to that which is the cause of the use of a word (sadda-ppavatti-nimitta). To explain, it is said:

A suffix in the sense of "condition" (bhāva) expresses whatever causes cognition (buddhi) and language (sadda) to arise.

In the RŪPA-SIDDHI, however, it is said that "-Nya, -tta, and -tā designate a characteristic (guna) whose condition (bhāva) causes the use of a word with respect to a particular thing (dabba)." In this [statement], a characteristic whose means "a qualifier (visesana) whose" and with respect to a particular thing means "with respect to a qualified thing (visesya)". It is said that "there are twelve suffixes used in the sense of a condition (bhāva) of a particular (dabba)" and, thus, with the exception of the five suffixes appointed by the sūtras, ${ }^{1}$ the remaining suffixes, namely, ttanaṃ, tthaṃ, tvaṃ, tatvaṃ, Nika, Niya, and Nila, are to be understood from the mention of $t u$ (and/but). In this connection, the BīĀKIYYĀ states:

The sūtra teaches that there are five suffixes that are used with respect to nominal derivatives in the sense of "condition" (bhāva). The experts in nominal derivatives (taddhita) teach the remaining sūtras by means of the word tu.

In the KACCĀYANa, however, only the suffix -ttana is understood by means of implication. The NYĀSA-TTKĀ, though, states that there are eleven suffixes, yet elsewhere it states that there are eight suffixes. The RŪPA-SIDDHI states that:
by splitting the rule into two, (thereby isolating) nyattatā, the suffixes -Nya, etc., can also occur in the sense of the

object of an action ( kamma ) and in the sense of the nominal base (sakattha). With respect to the object of an action, the object of the action of heroes (vīra) is heroism (viriya). Likewise, there is "wife" (bhāriya), "dancing" (nātya), and "medicine" (bhesajja), etc. ... With respect to the sense of the nominal base (sakattha), kāruñña (compassion) simply means karunā (compassion). Likewise, there is pattakalla (the right time) [p. 27] and pāguñña (competent).
The suffix -Sya occurs in the sense of the nominal base among others ( $\bar{a} d i$ ) and -t $\bar{a}$ occurs [only] in the sense of the nominal base. ${ }^{1}$

The cause of the use of words, whether it be a name (nāma), universal (jāti), particular (dabba), action (kriyā), or quality (guṇa), is that condition (bhāva) due to which there is speech (sadda) and cognition (ñāna).

The syntactic construction [of the verse is as follows]: "That condition (bhāva) on account of which speech (sadda) and cognition (ñāna) arise is the cause of the use of words, whether it be a (1) name (nāma), (2) universal (jāti), (3) particular (dabba), (4) action (kriyā) or (5) quality (guṇa)." The import (of the verse is as follows): "that cause (nimitta) by which both speech and understanding arise is called a 'condition' (bhāva), and also that is fivefold, viz. name (nāma), universal (jāti), particular (dabba), action (kriyā) or quality (guṇa)." I will explain the details of the five-fold division, that is, name, etc., later under the topic of kāraka.
(I) The condition of the moon (canda), that is, moonness (candatta), [is a name (nāma)] and, in this connection, it is due to the name that the word "moon" refers to a particular moon. Cognition [arises] in accordance with the nature of the cause (i.e. the name). The import is that "the word 'moon' does not refer to a particular moon due to a universal (jāti), quality (guṇa) or action (kriyā) and that cognition arises only in accordance with the nature of the proper name (saññā), [which is the cause of the use of the word 'moon'], and not in accordance with the nature of a universal, etc." The cause for the use of words is called "a cause for the application of words" (sadda-ppavatti-nimitta). When a word refers to a particular it is called a "signifier of a particular"

[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ This sentence (sakatthādīsu nyo sakatthe tā ca sakatthādīsu pi nyappaccayo sakatthe tāppaccayo ca hontl ti), as recorded in Subhūti's transcription, appears to restate the same information twice with the simple addition of the word suffix (paccaya) in the second half of the sentence. This being so, we take this to be a scribal error and we have simply given the sense of the statement in our translation without duplication.
(dabbavācakatta). When cognition occurs with respect to a particular it is called "arising in the sphere of a particular" (dabbavisaye uppādo). One should also understand it in this way later [in this work].
(2) Likewise, human-ness (manussatta) is due to the universal "human" (manussajāti), and it is in connection with that that the word "human" (manussa) designates a particular type of human. Cognition of the universal arises in accordance with the nature of the universal, which is a cause for the use of the [word denoting] the universal "human" (manussa), and it does not arise due to name, etc.
(3) By means of the sūtra "yad" etc. (Kacc 393, yadanupapann $\bar{a}$ nipātanā sijjhanti ("Those words that cannot be derived are to be established as given"), there is a shortening of the sound $l$ of the word $d a b b \bar{l}$ ("he who has a particular") [in the expression dabbitta "the condition of possessing a particular"]. The "condition of possessing a particular" (dabbitta) is due to the relationship between a particular and [another] particular, and it is in connection with that that there is the word dabb $\bar{l}$ ("he who possesses a particular"), since dabb $\bar{l}$ means "he who has a particular" (dabbo assa atthi). Cognition arises only with the relationship between a particular and [another] particular as its cause, in accordance with the nature of the relationship between a particular and the possessor of the particular that is a cause. It does not arise due to the name of a particular, such as a particular with the name "Devadatta".
(4) Cook/chef-ness (pācakatta) is due to the relationship [between a particular] and the act of cooking (pacana), and it is in connection with that that there is the word "cook" (pācaka) since pācaka means "he who cooks" (pacati). Cognition arises with the relationship with the act of cooking as its cause, in accordance with the nature of the relationship with the act of cooking that is a cause. It does not arise due to a name, etc., [used] with respect to a particular [person], such as Devadatta, who is connected to the act of cooking (pacana).
(5) Blueness (nīlatta) is due to blue quality (nīla-guna), and it is in connection with that that there is the word "blue" (nīla). The cognition of blue arises in accordance with the nature of the quality blue which has become a cause, and it does not arise due to a name, etc., [used] in connection with a particular, such as a pot which has the colour blue. ${ }^{1}$

# 16. CŪLA-NIRUTTI ${ }^{2}$ 

There are two works that have this name. One of these is a very old work composed by venerable Yamaka Mahā Thera. The Cūḷa-nirutti must be even older than the Nyāsa, which is one of the oldest works among the extant Pali grammatical texts, since the Nyāsa mentions it by name. There is also a commentary on the Cūḷa-nirutti called the "Mahjūsā", which appears to be older than the Rūpa-siddhi, since the latter quotes examples from this work, such as the following verse:

Addressing (āmantana) means getting the attention of an existent thing by means of a word. But there is not [the use of the vocative] when [someone] is being ordered. [For instance,] rājā bhava ("Become king!"). ${ }^{3}$
The older Cūḷa-nirutti states that there are only forty sounds (aksara) in the Pali language and omits retroflex " $l$ ": "akkharāni samacattālīsa ti vidham". Some verses from the work are as follows:

The grammarians teach that the manifest [sound] called the niggahīta is thought to be the connector between consonants and vowels. The sounds and the number [of sounds] are included by means of the word api. He (Kaccāyana) therefore uttered (pakāseti) the excellent word api in the middle [of the sūtra] (?). ${ }^{4}$ The articulation [of sounds] is

    ${ }^{2}$ See Franke 1902, 29; Pind 2012, 107-10. Franke only mentions that the work is discussed by Subhūti. Pind $(2012,107)$ dates the work to the "second half of the ninth century".

    ${ }^{4}$ Ole Pind (2012, p. 107) has contended that Cūḷ-nir is a commentary on the Kacc. In support, this passage quoted by Subhūti from the Cūḷ-nir seems to be
four-fold, viz. (1) full contact (phutthatta), (2) slight contact (isaphutthatta), (3) closed (samvuta), and (4) open (vivaṭa). The class consonants (vagga) have full contact [of the instruments] of articulation, i.e. tip of the tongue, middle of the tongue, etc., and $y a, r a, l a$, and $v a$ have a slight contact [of the instrument of articulation]. All long [vowels] have an open [instrument of articulation] and short [vowels] have a closed [instrument of articulation]. The first of the class consonants are considered to be without breath (anādavanta) and very hot (atyunha) (?). ${ }^{1}$ The second of the class consonants are considered to be with breath (nādavanta) and hot (uṇhavanta) (?). The third and fifth of the class consonants are with breath and very hot, and the fourth of the class consonants is also with breath and hot (?). ${ }^{2}$

# 17. ABHINAVA-CŪĢA-NIRUTTI ${ }^{3}$ 

The Abhinava-cūla-nirutti, that is, the "New" Cūla-nirutti, is a small work composed sometime after the Nyāsa by the venerable Sirisaddhammālañkāra Thera. It teaches new procedures for the derivation of words (not mentioned in the Kaccāyana) that are based on the
commenting, in part, on Kacc 2 akkharā p' ādayo ekacattālīsaṃ. The reference to the word api (apikāra) only makes some sort of sense in relation to the word pi in Kacc 2.
1 As far as we are aware, the technical terms nādavat/anādavat (lit. with/without voice) and uṇha/atyunha (lit. hot/very hot, Sk. uṣnā) are unique to the Cūla-nirutti. It is unclear to us in what sense these technical terms are being used.

interpretation of " $c a$ " and " $v \bar{a}$ " in the Kaccāyana sūtras. A few of the sūtras are explained in this work as follows:
sarā sare lopam (Kacc I2, Vowels before a vowel are to be elided):
The mention of the singular [sare] has the purpose [p. 29] of excluding the mention of all [vowels] (?). In order to include consonants (byañjana), there is sarà sare lopam and byañjanāni byañjane lopam (?). For instance, mohanassa ("of delusion") + khassa ("of a cavern"?) + mālā ("garland") = mekhalā ("a girdle"); bhavesu ("among lives)" + vantagamano ("he who has renounced journeying") $=$ bhagavā ("the Blessed One").
kvacāsavap̣̣am lutte (Kacc I4, When [the preceding vowel] has been elided, [the following vowel] sometimes turns into a nonhomogeneous vowel): Why is lutte mentioned? The mention of lutte indicates that, when the preceding vowel has been elided, the following vowel turns into a non-homogeneous vowel. For instance: muni (sage) + ālayo ("abode") = munelayo ("home of sages"), isi (rishi) + ālayo ("abode") = iselayo ("home of the rishis"), rathi ("charioteer") + āsabho ("bull/chief") = rathesabho ("lord of charioteers").
simhi gacchantādinaṃ antasaddo aṃ (Kacc 186, When the [nom. sg. suffix] -si follows, the -anta sound of gacchanta etc. becomes -am): By splitting the rule into two (i.e. by separating simhi), five different readings should be understood: When the [nom. pl. suffix] -yo follows, the -anta sound of gacchanta etc. becomes -am.... When the [abl. sg. suffix] -smā follows, the -anta sound of gacchanta, etc., becomes -am. [For example:] "the travelling (gacchanto or gacchaṃ) wise men meet" (nom. pl.), gacchaṃ or gacchantena (inst. sg.), gacchaṃ or gacchantānaṃ (dat. pl.), "from the travelling (gacchaṃ or gacchantasmā) person" (abl. sg.). By the mention of ādi ("etc."), the -anta sound can also turn into -anti. Thus, gacchaṃ or gacchanti.
sesesu ntu va (Kacc 187, When the remaining case endings follow, the sound -anta should be treated like -ntu): By splitting the rule into two (i.e. separating sesesu), words ending in -anta, except gacchanta, can also be treated like [words ending] in the suffix -ntu when the first case suffix follows. For instance: arahā ("worthy/Arahant").
kattari ca (Kacc 288, The third case also occurs in the sense of the grammatical agent): The mention of $c a$ ("and") serves to indicate that the first case also occurs in the semantico-syntactic sense (käraka) of the grammatical agent.
tad assāthī ti vi ca (Kacc 366, The suffix -vī occurs in the sense of "this is his"): The mention of $c a$ ("and") serves to indicate that the
suffixes -so, -viya, and -iva also occur in the sense of "this is his". For example: "The family/clan (kula) is his, thus he is kulaso ('possessor of the clan')"; "The territory (padesa) is his, thus he is padesaviyo ('possessor of the territory')"; "The wheel (cakka) is his, thus he is cakkivo ('possessor of the wheel')".
sabbato uṃ iṇsu (Kacc 506, After all [verbal bases], there is [the substitute] -imsu for the [3rd. pl.] suffix -um): The mention of sabbato serves to indicate that there are also the substitutes -amsu and -esum for the suffix -um. For example: agamamsu ("they went"), adamsu ("they gave"), and pâturahesum ("they appeared").
bhujādinam anto no dvi ca (Kacc 580, na occurs at the end of the verbal base bhuj etc. and [the suffix -ta] is doubled): The mention of $c a$ (and) serves to indicate that $n a$ occurs at the end of verbal bases other than bhuj etc. For instance: ramati tâyā ti ratti (ratti "enjoyment": One enjoys by means of this), yujjati tâyā ti yutti (yutti "connection": One is connected by means of this), vipajjati tâyā ti vipatti (vipatti "misfortune": One is hindered by means of this). ${ }^{1}$
The opening verses of the Abhinava-cūḷa-nirutti are as follows:

Having first paid homage to the three objects [of veneration] and to Kaccāyana, I will speak about language (nirutti). Pay attention to my words. The old work called the Cūla-NIRUTTI composed by the ancients has been examined (lakkhita) by the learned Sirisaddhammālañkāra Thera, who desires merit and cherishes good conduct. Through this merit, may I become a Buddha in the world. By this meritorious act, until I become a Buddha, may I have wisdom like Mahosadha, have wealth like Jotiseṭhi, and be charitable like Vessantara in life after life. ${ }^{1}$
