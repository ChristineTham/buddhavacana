# Preface 

An Analysis of the Pali Canon was originally the work of A.C. March, the founder-editor of Buddhism in England (from 1943, The Middle Way), the quarterly journal of The Buddhist Lodge (now The Buddhist Society, London). It appeared in the issues for Volume 3 and was later offprinted as a pamphlet. Finally, after extensive revision by I.B. Horner (the late President of the Pali Text Society) and Jack Austin, it appeared as an integral part of A Buddhist Student's Manual, published in 1956 by The Buddhist Society to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of its founding. The basic analysis of the Tipitaka appeared in The Mahā Bodhi, 37:19-42 (Calcutta 1929), and was reprinted in K.D.P. Wickremesinghe's Biography of the Buddha (Colombo 1972).

In the present edition, the basic analysis of the Canon has been left in its original state although some minor corrections had to be made. However, it has been found possible to fully explore the Saṃyutta and Anuguttara Nikāyas together with three important texts from the Khuddaka Nikāya: Udāna, Itivuttaka, and Suttanipāta. It was deemed unnecessary to give similar treatment to the Dhammapada, as this popular anthology is much more readily accessible. The Paṭisambhidāmagga has also been analysed.

The index (except for minor amendments) was originally prepared by G.F. Allen and first appeared in his book The Buddha's Philosophy. In this edition it has been simplified by extensive substitution of Arabic for Roman numerals.

The Bibliography, a necessary adjunct in view of the reference nature of the whole work, has, however, been completely revised as a consequence of the vast output of books on the subject that have come on to the market over the past few decades. Indeed, it was originally intended to make this an exhaustive section of Pali works in the English language, past and present. A number of anthologies, however, include both suttas in their entirety and short extracts from the texts. In such cases the compiler has, where the works in question appear, only indicated the complete suttas, as it is hardly likely that brief passages in such (possibly out-of-print) books will be referred to by the student who can now so easily turn to complete texts. Moreover, to keep the Bibliography to a manageable size, it was also necessary to omit a number of anthologies which include selected translations available from other, more primary sources.

It is thus hoped that this short work will awaken in the reader a desire to study the original texts themselves, the most authoritative Buddhist documents extant. Space has precluded a detailed study of the Tipitaka from the standpoints of language and chronology, but the source books mentioned in the Bibliography will more than compensate for this omission.

# I. Textual Analysis 

The Pali Canon, also called the Tipitaka or "Three Baskets" (of doctrine), is divided into three major parts:
A. Vinaya Piṭaka: The Collection of Disciplinary Rules.

C. Abhidhamma Piṭaka: The Collection of Philosophical Treatises.

## A. Vinaya Piṭaka-the Collection of Disciplinary Rules

## 1. Sutta Vibhanga

There are 220 rules and 7 legal procedures for monks consisting of eight classes:
(a) Four rules, if infringed, entail expulsion from the Order (pārājika). These are sexual intercourse, theft, taking a human life or inciting another to commit suicide, and falsely boasting of supernormal attainments.
(b) Thirteen rules entailing initial and subsequent meetings of the Sangha (saṅghādisesa).
(c) Two rules are indefinite (aniyata).
(d) Thirty rules entail expiation with forfeiture (nissaggiya pācittiya).
(e) Ninety-two rules entail expiation (pācittiya).
(f) Four rules require confession (pātidesanīya).
(g) Seventy-five rules are concerned with etiquette and decorum (sekhiya).

The work opens with a mātikā, a "matrix" or schedule of categories which classifies the totality of phenomena into a scheme of twenty-two triads (tika), sets of three terms, and a hundred dyads (duka), sets of two terms. The mātikā also includes a Suttanta matrix, a schedule of forty-two dyads taken from the suttas. The mātikā serves as a framework for the entire Abhidhamma, introducing the diverse perspectives from which all phenomena are to be classified. The body of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī consists of four parts:
1.1."States of Consciousness," which analyses all states of consciousness into their constituent factors, each of which is elaborately defined.
1.2. "Matter," which enumerates and classifies the various types of material phenomena.
1.3. "The Summary," offering concise explanations of all the terms in both the Abhidhamma and Suttanta matrixes.
1.4. "The Synopsis," offering more condensed explanations of the Abhidhamma matrix but not the Suttanta matrix.

Vibhaṅga: "Distinction or Determination." Continued analysis of the foregoing. The Vibhanga contains eighteen chapters, dealing in turn with the following: Aggregates, sense bases, elements, truths, faculties, dependent arising, foundations of mindfulness, supreme efforts, means to accomplishment, factors of enlightenment, the eightfold path, jhānas, illimitables (or Brahma-vihāras), training rules, analytical knowledges, kinds of knowledge, defilements, and "the heart of the doctrine" (a concise overview of the Buddhist universe).

Dhātukathā: "Discussion of Elements." This book discusses all phenomena with reference to the three schemes of aggregates, sense bases and elements. It attempts to determine whether, and to what extent, they are included or not included in them, and whether they are associated with them or dissociated from them.

Puggalapaññatti: The body of this work provides formal definitions of different types of individuals. It has ten chapters: The first deals with single types of individuals, the second with pairs, the third with groups of three, etc.

Kathāvatthu: Discussion of the points of controversy between the early "Hīnayāna" sects, and the defence of the Theravada viewpoint. Attributed to Moggaliputta Tissa, the president of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ council, which was convened at Patna by the Emperor Asoka in the middle of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ century BCE.

Yamaka: This book has the purpose of resolving ambiguities and defining the precise usage of technical terms. It is called the "Book of Pairs" because it employs throughout pairs of questions which approach the subject under investigation from converse points of view. For example, the first pair of questions runs thus: "Are all wholesome phenomena wholesome roots? And are all wholesome roots wholesome phenomena?" The book contains ten chapters:
Roots, aggregates, sense bases, elements, truths, formations, latent dispositions, consciousness, phenomena, and faculties.

Patṭhāna: The "Book of Relations." Causation and the mutual relationship of phenomena are examined. The special contribution of the Paṭthāna is the elaboration of a scheme of twenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) for plotting the causal connections between different types of phenomena. The body of the work applies these conditional relations to all the phenomena included in the Abhidhamma matrix. The book has four great divisions: Origination according to the positive method, origination according to the negative method, origination according to the positive-negative method, and origination according to the negative-positive method. Each of these in turn has six subdivisions: Origination of triads, dyads, dyads and triads combined, triads and dyads combined, triads and triads combined, and dyads and dyads combined. In the Burmese-script Sixth Council edition of the Pali Canon, the Paṭthāna comprises five volumes totalling 2500 pages. Because of its great size as well as its philosophical importance, it is also known as the Mahāpakaraṇa, "the Great Treatise."

# III. Bibliography 

## 1. Translated Texts

The Pali Text Society (founded in 1881) has published English translations of the Pali texts from 1909. To date (2006) only the Niddesa and Apadāna from the Khuddaka Nikāya and Yamaka from the Abhidhamma Piṭaka remain untranslated out of the entire Canon. Apart from their own series (PTS, and SBB—Sacred Books of the Buddhists), there are five others of note: Sacred Books of the East (SBE—reprinted from the 1960s by UNESCO via Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi); The Wheel and Bodhi Leaf series of the Buddhist Publication Society (BPS); The Mahā Bodhi Society in either India or Sri Lanka (MBS); the (now defunct) Bauddha Sahitya Sabha (Buddhist Literature Society-BSS); and the Buddhist Missionary Society (BMS) of Kuala Lumpur. In addition, a few individual texts have appeared from Sinhalese, Indian, Burmese, Thai, English, and American publishers.
(To avoid the tedium of indicating the years of reprints of those works that have run into several editions, only the years of the first and latest editions have been shown. In the case of BPS publications, however, because these are normally kept in print, only the year of initial publication is shown).

## 6. Journals

Innumerable popular Buddhist magazines and academic periodicals publish translations from the Pali Canon together with studies of the language and later or related literature. Invaluable
studies are recorded in the journals of the Pali Text Society (1882-1927, reprinted 1978, and revived in 1981), Royal Asiatic Society, European, American, Indian, Sri Lankan and Thai university Oriental faculties and learned societies. However, three journals should be singled out for special mention:

The Blessing, ed. Cassius A. Perera (later Kassapa Thera), published by the Servants of the Buddha, Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka. This appeared in ten issues during 1925 and contained, almost exclusively, translations from the SP (notably M 51-70) by Nārada and Mahinda.

The Light of the Dhamma, ed. David Maurice for the Union Buddha Sasana Council, Rangoon 1952-63. Apart from containing (on average) two suttas in each issue, this quarterly provided the first popular outlet for the writings of Ledi Sayādaw, Ñāṇamoli, Nyanaponika, Nyanasatta, Nyanatiloka, Francis Story and other leading Theravādins. Many of their translations and essays subsequently appeared in The Wheel series of the Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy.

Pali Buddhist Review, ed. Russell Webb for the Pali Buddhist Union, Ilford, Essex (later London) 1976-82. This appeared thrice yearly and included translations and exegeses.
