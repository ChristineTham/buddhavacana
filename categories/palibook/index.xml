&lt;div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Part of &amp;ldquo;A Beginner (Non-Linguist) Guide to Learning Pali&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I am a relative beginner in learning Pali. I started learning the language in
earnest on 30 June 2023. This is my conceited attempt at thinking I can author my own Pali textbook,
based on what I have learnt so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why write my own book when there are so many excellent textbooks already on
Pali?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first, and best answer, is that I don&amp;rsquo;t learn until I am able to explain
it to someone else, even if that someone else is an imaginary reader. There is
nothing more conducive to solidifying knowledge than to have to distill it and
explain it in language a &amp;ldquo;golden retriever can understand&amp;rdquo; (to paraphrase a
line from the film &lt;em>Margin Call&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, I find other Pali textbooks, particularly the ones written by
English (or European) linguists confusing and somewhat frustrating. They use
highly technical linguistic terms, which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand well. Their
grammatical explanations can often be over complicated and obtuse. I am not
saying every book is like this, there are many examples of books that appear to
be clearly written. Perhaps the one who is obtuse is me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find I learn a language best &amp;ldquo;natively&amp;rdquo;, ie. by its own terms and gradually
&amp;ldquo;bootstrapping&amp;rdquo; myself until I achieve a minimum viable level of competency to
start reading text. As children, this is how we learn a language, by osmosis
from hearing others, until we are confident enough to form our own words.
We then improve by reading, which broadens our knowledge and proficiency
further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are no native speakers of Pali, but fortunately there are books
describing the Pali language written by ancient Pali speakers. The earliest,
and probably most well known is the &lt;strong>Kaccāyana Pali Vyākaraṇam&lt;/strong>. This was
probably written in the 5th-6th century CE, and the author has been ascribed
to the Arahat Mahākaccāyana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are, of course, other Pali grammars, including those written by
Moggalāna (circa 11-12 AD), Saddanīti (circa 1157 AD) and Rūpasiddhi (circa
13 AD). However, to avoid confusion from multiple sources, I have decided to
primarily derive my textbook from Kaccāyana. Also, there is an excellent
translation of Kaccāyana into English (which I am heavily reliant on)
by A. Thitzana which can be downloaded for free from
&lt;a href="https://store.pariyatti.org/kaccayana-pali-grammar-vol1-2">Kaccāyana Pāli Grammar Volumes 1 - 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In authoring this textbook, I have decided to avoid using linguistic technical
terms as much as possible (such as conjugation, declension, nominative, etc.)
but use &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; English words to describe elements of the Pali language. I
will use Pali terminology to describe aspects of the Pali language as much as I
can, and only resort to English to describe what they mean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you will find my textbook do not use the same terms as you will find in
other Pali textbooks and grammar books. I apologise in advance if this leads
to confusion and frustration. I will attempt to point out the equivalent
terms used in other textbooks whenever possible, to help readers in drawing
comparisons if they wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I do so because I feel strongly that it is best to learn Pali on it&amp;rsquo;s
own terms, and not impose an external linguistic framework on it. Such
frameworks may be useful to linguists, but they tend to confuse beginners like
me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-and-structure">Goal and Structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The aim of this textbook is to get the reader to a level where they can
tackle the texts in the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> (the Three Baskets of the Buddhist canon) as
quickly as possible. Less emphasis is placed on the ability to listen, speak
or write.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most Pali textbooks gently introduce the various features of the language over
a number of chapters, so significant progress needs to be made before a reader
is able to understand moderately complex sentences, let alone entire &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code>s
from the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code>. For example, A.K. Warder&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Pali&amp;rdquo; covers
the basics of Pali grammar over 16 lessons. Assuming a reader will cover 1-2
lessons per week, this means a reader is not ready to read the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> until
2-4 months later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By contrast, this textbook gives an overview of all the essential features of
the Pali language in the first chapter, so the reader in theory should have
the key knowledge to read the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> in days, or weeks, rather than months,
or years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am speaking from experience. I started studying Pali in late June,
and by mid July I was already starting to read my first &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How is this achieved? All the complex production rules with regards to &lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code>
and word endings are moved to appendices. The goal is to enable the reader to
be able to read Pali, not necessarily to be able to write or speak it. So
the reader can study the production rules based on their own needs and priority
rather than being forced to apply them from the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, unlike other textbooks, this textbook does not focus on teaching
vocabulary, nor does it require the reader to memorise long lists of words.
Vocabulary is introduced only when necessary, and just before it is required.
The reader is encouraged to develop their own vocabulary based on the material
they choose to read, and therefore they only need to learn the words that are
important to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the initial overview of the Pali language, the textbook alternates from
diving deeper into aspects of the Pali language, to exercises involving
reading, understanding and translating extracts from the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code>. The
reader is encouraged not to necessarily follow the textbook linearly but
tackle chapters in their own order of preference, or to embark on their own
reading journey and read whatever parts of the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> they wish to,
using the textbook merely as a reference and light guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This textbook does not require prior familiarity with either the Pali
language or the Buddhist Pali canon. It does, however, require the reader
to have a strong interest in both and willing to focus their efforts in
learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowledge of multiple languages (including computer languages) and prior
experience in learning a foreign language can be advantageous, but not
required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This textbook takes advantage of modern technology. It is not written in
paper but available as hyperlinked pages on a website. It also assumes the
reader has access to and is familiar with modern tools such as the
&lt;a href="https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/">Digital Pali Dictionary&lt;/a> or the
online version of The Pali Text Society&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/pali/">Pali-English Dictionary&lt;/a> so the
reader can easily look up any words they are encountering for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, the Digital Pali Dictionary can look up words in inflected form
and has advanced features like &lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code> splitting and compound word
deconstruction, which further reduces the need to learn how to do those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the textbook also assumes the reader is familiar with electronic
editions of the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code>, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;dl>
&lt;dt>&lt;a href="https://suttacentral.net">SuttaCentral&lt;/a>&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>SuttaCentral contains early Buddhist texts, known as the Tipiṭaka or “Three Baskets”. This is a large collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha or his earliest disciples, who were teaching in India around 2500 years ago. They are regarded as sacred canon in all schools of Buddhism.&lt;/dd>

&lt;div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Every writer&amp;rsquo;s style is influenced by their background and personal interests.
My interests in music and photography have influenced my approach to
structuring this textbook. In particular, I think of constructing Pali word
endings as similar to music composition, applying the rules of harmony
and I refer to the noun genders as &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo;. I also have a tendency
to shift viewpoints and zoom in and out of specific topics much like a
photographer would. I do apologise if you are not used to my way of thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Familiarity with software development and even a cursory knowledge of
computer languages will also be advantageous. I believe computer literacy
should be regarded as a fundamental aspect of basic literacy, and the ability
to &amp;ldquo;program&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; is as important as reading, writing, and &amp;lsquo;rithmetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said that, even prior exposure to writing web pages or the most basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS is probably enough of an advantage. I use a notation
similar to functional programming to label word endings, and sometimes
illustrate a sentence&amp;rsquo;s meaning using pseudo UML diagrams. Even if the reader
has no prior experience of either, hopefully the notation should be
self-evident.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
In this book, references to Kaccāyana are denoted by eg. {8} (8th &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code> or
&amp;ldquo;grammatical rule&amp;rdquo;). Altogether there are 675 suttas, which shows how compact
Kaccāyana is.
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Pali, like most other Indo-Aryan languages, is an oral language spoken as
&lt;code>vākya&lt;/code> (sentences) made up of &lt;code>vacana&lt;/code> (words) which are a combination of
&lt;code>akkhara&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;sounds&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;letters from an &amp;ldquo;alphabet&amp;rdquo;). {1}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are debates about the origin of Pali, whether it was in fact a real language
actually spoken by people, as opposed to an &amp;ldquo;invented&amp;rdquo; language specifically
for the purposes of recording Buddhist doctrine. The term &amp;ldquo;Pali&amp;rdquo; actually
just means &amp;ldquo;text&amp;rdquo;, and today &amp;ldquo;Pali&amp;rdquo; is used primarily for Buddhist literature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pali-alphabet-and-pronunciation-2-9">Pali Alphabet and pronunciation {2}-{9}&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Buddha may have spoken a language similar to Pali, and when he died his
sayings were collected and systematised so they can be transmitted orally
generation to generation using memorisation techniques such as chanting. The
Pali canon was not written down until hundreds of years after the Buddha has
passed away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such, there is no &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Pali alphabet or writing. Pali can be transcribed
fairly faithfully in a number of alphabets, including Roman letters (with the
addition of a few diacritical marks or accented characters similar to other
European languages).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this textbook, I will use Roman letters as the basis for the Pali alphabet
since I am used to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, no one knows for sure how Pali words would have been pronounced,
and how Pali sentences would have been spoken, particularly with regards to
tonality. Modern day Pali pronunciation is based on how the Buddhist Pali canon
is chanted in various countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://christham.net/buddhavacana/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/alphabet/">&lt;strong>B: The Pāli Alphabet&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="pali-sentence-structure">Pali sentence structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Pali sentence (&lt;code>vākya&lt;/code>) or Pali text (&lt;code>pali&lt;/code>) is generally composed of
multiple words (&lt;code>pada&lt;/code> or &lt;code>vacana&lt;/code>). Since Pali was an oral language,
punctuation mark and upper/lower case conventions are typically not used,
although modern editors have sometimes added these to aid reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Words also do not need to be separated by spaces, although modern Pali editions
of text do add spaces, to aid reading. Later on, we will find out Pali
has compound words, which consist of multiple words joined together to create a
composite word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able to distinguish words in a sentence, Pali relies
heavily on &lt;code>paccaya&lt;/code> (affixes to roots or word stems) to create distinctive
word endings. Fluent Pali listeners will no doubt listen to the sound of these
endings to distinguish the words. These endings also give additional meaning
to the words and indicate how the words are used in a sentence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of this, the word order in a Pali sentence is less important than many
other languages, however there are conventions for how to arrange words in a
typical sentence. Speakers can unconventionally reorder words, typically to
give emphasis to certain words or to augment or add nuance to a sentence&amp;rsquo;s
emotional meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is similar to our reaction when we hear &amp;ldquo;Yoda&amp;rdquo; speak in the &amp;ldquo;Star Wars&amp;rdquo;
series of films. We appreciate who Yoda is as a personality, and we pay more
attention to his words simply because of the different order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dhātu-roots">&lt;code>dhātu&lt;/code> (roots)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fundamentally, all words in Pali are said to be derived from one or more &lt;code>dhātu&lt;/code>
(roots). These roots are similar to Sanskrit roots. Pali can be regarded as
a simplified version of Sanskrit, however some of the roots may have different
meanings, or nuances. There are some that say Sanskrit was a &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; language
reserved for priests and members of the holy caste, whereas Pali, along with
many other Indian languages, was spoken by the common people. The Buddha may
have spoken in Pali because he wanted to convey his teachings to ordinary
people, not just privileged members of a particular caste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>dhātu&lt;/code> can have 1-3 syllables:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>type&lt;/th>
&lt;th>example&lt;/th>
&lt;th>meaning&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>single stem or one-syllable roots&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>vā&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to move&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>yā&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to go&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>pā&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to drink&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>ji&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to conquer&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>nī&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to carry&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>&lt;code>su&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to flow&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>to be&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>paca&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to cook&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>vada&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to speak&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>multiple-stem or three syllable roots&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>vāyama&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to attempt&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>araha&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to deserve&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>kilisa&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>to torment&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>A series
of transformations convert a root into a word by adding &lt;code>paccaya&lt;/code> (affixes).
Words can also be formed by combining a root with one or more &lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code>
(prefixes). Multiple &lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code> and different forms of &lt;code>paccaya&lt;/code> can be applied
to a root before it becomes a word, thus creating multi-syllabic
words. The result is a word that can be used in a sentence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Altogether there are around 1700 roots in Pali. However, many many words can
be made from them by attaching &lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code> (prefixes) and various affixes
(&lt;code>paccaya&lt;/code>). In theory, fresh words can be formed by new combinations of roots
with different prefixes so the adventurous Pali student can attempt to create
Pali words for &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; terms such as &amp;ldquo;computer&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;phone&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not really necessary to memorise the 1700 roots, although it will be
very useful if the reader chooses to do so. Knowing all the roots and the
various prefixes and affixes will allow the reader to sometimes (not always)
&amp;ldquo;guess&amp;rdquo; the meaning of a word not previously encountered, and will also help
when applying the various transformation rules (see below).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sandhi-word-transformations">&lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code> (word transformations)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As Pali is a spoken language, when words are combined to form a sentence,
changes may occur between words (or sometimes even within a word) to make
the sentence &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo; better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In English, we often shorten words like &amp;ldquo;can not&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;I will&amp;rdquo; to
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;rdquo;. This happens very frequently in Pali, especially when two vowels become
adjacent to each other from two words next to each other, and there are complex
rules governing how such transformations occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a example {10} (don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the meaning of the words for now):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>tatra&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ayaṁ&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ādi&lt;/code>&lt;br>
= tatr&lt;del>a&lt;/del> + &lt;del>a&lt;/del>ā ya&lt;del>ṁ&lt;/del>m + ādi&lt;br>
= &lt;code>tatrā’ya’mādi&lt;/code>&lt;br>
= &lt;code>tatrāyamādi&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As you can see, when there are two adjacent vowels when we join two or more
words together, &lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code> typically involves deleting one of the vowels, and
then either retaining, lengthening or changing the remaining vowel. Sometimes
the consonant next to the vowel may also be changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overall effect is to make the words easier to say as a group. Although
&lt;code>tatrāyamādi&lt;/code> may seem like a single word because of &lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code>, a listener
should still regard them as separate words when trying to understand a
sentence. However, some &lt;code>sandhi&lt;/code> combinations of common words are so often
encountered they have acquired distinctive meaning as combined words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example {11}&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>tatra&lt;/code> + &lt;code>abhiratiṁ&lt;/code> + &lt;code>iccheyya&lt;/code>&lt;br>
= tatr&lt;del>a&lt;/del> + &lt;del>a&lt;/del>ā bhirati&lt;del>ṁ&lt;/del>m + iccheyya&lt;br>
= &lt;code>tatrā’bhirati’miccheyya&lt;/code>&lt;br>
= &lt;code>tatrābhiratimiccheyya&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; should prefer enjoying at that &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For the time being, we are not going to go into detail on these rules but
be aware that words may change in a sentence. Eventually, as you read more
and more sentences in Pali, these changes will become easier to recognise.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="nāmā-nouns-52">&lt;code>nāmā&lt;/code> (nouns) {52}&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nāmā&lt;/code> are the most common type of words in Pali, and roughly (but not exactly)
correspond to the term &amp;ldquo;noun&amp;rdquo; in English. &lt;code>nāmā&lt;/code> also means &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo;, so these
words represent things that we can &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; - including people, places, things,
numbers, feelings and many other objects or concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="example-53">Example {53}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Here is a simple sentence, consisting of 3 &lt;code>nāma&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>eso no satthā&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>which translates as:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>that person/being / our / teacher&lt;br>
&lt;em>That person [is] our teacher.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead of &lt;code>satthā&lt;/code> other examples may be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>brahmā&lt;/code> (God)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>attā&lt;/code> (self)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;code>rājā&lt;/code> (King)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="liṅga-gender-53">&lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code> (gender) {53}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nāma&lt;/code> can be classified into 3 different types or &lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code>. The word &lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code>
actually means &amp;ldquo;gender&amp;rdquo;, and traditionally each &lt;code>nāma&lt;/code> is assigned a gender. The
&lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code> represents an &amp;ldquo;intrinsic property&amp;rdquo; of the &lt;code>nāma&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The notion of a Pali gender is similar to (but not quite the same as) genders
in some European languages. However, there are differences that it&amp;rsquo;s best to
regard &lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code> as a classification scheme or grammatical construct rather than
what we may think of as &amp;ldquo;gender&amp;rdquo;. I like to think of it this way:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>pulliṅga&lt;/code> - the &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; type. Most nouns fall into this category.
Generally associated with masculinity or masculine persons (but not always)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>napuṁsakaliṅga&lt;/code> - the &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; type. Tend to be used for nouns that don&amp;rsquo;t
quite fit with the notions of masculinity or feminity, or represent abstract
concepts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>itthiliṅga&lt;/code> - the &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; type, comparatively rare with respect to the
other two types. Generally associated with feminity or feminine persons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that for the remainder of this book, we may refer to the above &lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code>
by the following symbols for brevity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>🚹 = &lt;code>pulliṅga&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🚻 = &lt;code>napuṁsakaliṅga&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🚺 = &lt;code>itthiliṅga&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ancient India was a patriarchal society, and men were regarded as the &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo;
component of society, doing activities considered important, hence the
tendency is to associate important words to &lt;code>pulliṅga&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="number">Number&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Like in English, Pali words are slightly different depending on whether they are
used to refer to one thing vs many things.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>👤 = &lt;code>ekavacana&lt;/code> (singular)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>👥 = &lt;code>bahuvacana&lt;/code> (plural)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There used to be also a &amp;ldquo;dual&amp;rdquo; form but that is now largely obsolete and
encountered in very rare instances. Examples include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>to idh’āgato&lt;/code> (these two having come)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>ubho&lt;/code> (both)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>mātāpitu&lt;/code> (father and mother)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="vibhatti-case-endings-54">&lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> (case endings) {54}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unlike English, words need to be &amp;ldquo;transformed&amp;rdquo; before they are used in a
sentence. This is done by adding endings or &amp;ldquo;suffixes&amp;rdquo; to the word (&lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Altogether there are seven types of &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code>, and they are
conveniently numbered 1 to 7 {55}:&lt;/p>

&lt;td>&lt;code>sattamī&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;seventh&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You may note the 4th and 6th case endings are the same, which means in practice
we can only tell which case is being used by context (more later). Notice also
the plural endings for some of the cases are the same. Again, which case is
being used can only be determined by context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example. Suppose we have the word 🚹&lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;man&amp;rdquo;) and we
want to use it in a sentence in singular form, and we wish to transform it using
the 1st case ending (&lt;code>paṭhamāvibhatti&lt;/code>). If we look up the above table, we
should add the &lt;code>si&lt;/code> ending:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> → &lt;code>puriso&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait, what happened? Why does the transformation not result in &lt;code>purisasi&lt;/code>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where additional rules comes into play. By rule of {83}, any
word ending in &lt;code>a&lt;/code> will be transformed into the 1st case by deleting
the &lt;code>a&lt;/code> and by rule of {104} replacing the &lt;code>si&lt;/code> with &lt;code>o&lt;/code>. Kaccāyana has a whole
chapter of such rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the transformation becomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code>&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>puris&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> {83}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>puris&lt;/code> + &lt;del>&lt;code>si&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>o&lt;/code>) {104}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>puriso&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plural form undergoes a similar transformation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> + &lt;code>yo&lt;/code>&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>puris&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> {83}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>puris&lt;/code> + &lt;del>&lt;code>yo&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>ā&lt;/code>) {107}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>purisā&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does make things interesting, because the transformation result for every
word then depends on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kāra’nta&lt;/code> (word ending)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>liṅga&lt;/code> (gender)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>ekavacana&lt;/code> (singular) vs. &lt;code>bahuvacana&lt;/code> (plural)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> (desired case ending)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a table of &lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> transformed in all the 7 cases and
singular vs plural.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You will note that in some of the cases, there are multiple ways the word can
be transformed. For example, singular &lt;code>purisa&lt;/code> can be transformed in the 3rd
case into either &lt;code>purisehi&lt;/code> or &lt;code>purisebhi&lt;/code>. Both are acceptable. Which should we
use for a given sentence? It depends on the &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo; - a native speaker would
have chosen the version that sounded the most pleasing, depending on surrounding
words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rules can be quite complicated, so let&amp;rsquo;s not worry about them for now.
In practice, you can rely on looking up a relevant table to determine the
appropriate transformation (TBD). If you are just reading Pali, then with
practice you will learn to recognise the various endings which will become
familiar to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Reference&lt;/h4>
A summary of the rules is provided in
&lt;a href="https://christham.net/buddhavacana/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/vibhatti/">&lt;strong>G: &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> Rules&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A much more important question to answer at this point is &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-do-we-need-vibhatti-endings-and-what-is-their-purpose">Why do we need &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings and what is their purpose?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In English, when we see a sentence like&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We know that words &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;brown&amp;rdquo; refers to the &amp;ldquo;fox&amp;rdquo;, which is the
&amp;ldquo;subject&amp;rdquo; of the sentence, and &amp;ldquo;lazy&amp;rdquo; refers to the dog, which is the &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo;
of the sentence. The verb &amp;ldquo;jumped over&amp;rdquo; separates the subject and the object.
Our brain automatically &amp;ldquo;collects&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;groups&amp;rdquo; the words, so we read the
sentence as:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(The quick brown fox) jumped over (the lazy dog).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In English, as we can see, word order is important. If we mixed the words up,
the sentence becomes far harder to read:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Over the quick lazy brown fox the dog jumped.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This sentence would imply quite a different meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Pali, all words with the same gender and the same case ending should be
grouped together, and that&amp;rsquo;s how we distinguish which words belong to which
entity. So the word order becomes far less important, we could mix the words
up and the sentence would still have the same meaning!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, the 1st case is usually reserved for the &amp;ldquo;most important&amp;rdquo; entity
in a sentence, the 2nd for the &amp;ldquo;second most important&amp;rdquo; and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in the above English sentence, were it to be translated the Pali, &amp;ldquo;the
quick brown fox&amp;rdquo; would all be in the 1st case, and &amp;ldquo;the lazy dog&amp;rdquo; would all be
in the 2nd case. If there are more entities, they would take the 3rd, 4th
cases and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many sentences, the 1st case would usually refer to the entity or actor
&amp;ldquo;performing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; the action (or, the &amp;ldquo;subject&amp;rdquo; of the sentence), and
the 2nd case refers to the entity being impacted by the action (the &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo;)
of the sentence. Although this is a very common pattern, it is by no means
rigid, and in theory any case ending can be used for any purpose. There are
many examples in the Pali canon where the cases are used in unconventional
ways. (TBD: need to include examples)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="vibhatti-usage-typical-meanings-271-315">Vibhatti usage typical meanings {271}-{315}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following meanings are usually associated with each
case. However, as noted above, these are conventions only, and the author of a
sentence may choose to adopt an unconventional approach of assigning words to
cases (perhaps for emphatic or stylistic reasons).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For a detailed explanation of the various meanings associated with each case
ending, please refer to the next chapter:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://christham.net/buddhavacana/buddhavacana/docs/palibook/cases/">&lt;strong>2: &lt;code>kāraka&lt;/code> (word ending) meanings&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
{271}-{315}&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>You may find in Pali grammar books written in English the following nomenclature
for the cases:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;nominative&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;accusative&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;instrumental&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;dative&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;ablative&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;genitive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7️⃣ = &amp;ldquo;locative&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that these terms only partially reflect the possible meanings and roles
associated with each case, so I would discourage using these terms. They can
lead to confusion. However, these terms are common in Pali-English dictionaries
so I encourage you to substitute the case number when you see these terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="0-ālapana-vocative-57">0️⃣ &lt;code>ālapana&lt;/code> (vocative) {57}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>English Pali textbooks often refer to a &amp;ldquo;vocative&amp;rdquo; case, but this is not
recognised as a separate case but a variant of the 1st case. The usual case
ending &lt;code>si&lt;/code> (for 1st case singular) is instead called &lt;code>ga&lt;/code> but the
transformation rules are similar to &lt;code>si&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>bhoti ayye&lt;/code>! (Oh madam!)&lt;br>
&lt;code>bhoti kaññe&lt;/code>! (Oh girl!)&lt;br>
&lt;code>bhoti kharādiye&lt;/code>! (Oh the girl named Kharādiya!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Contrast this to the normal 1st case form of &lt;code>ayyā&lt;/code> (🚺👤1️⃣):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sā ayyā&lt;/code> (that lady)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In plural:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>bhotiyo ayyāyo&lt;/code> (Oh Madams!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="sabbanāma-pronouns">&lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> (pronouns)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sabba&lt;/code> means &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; so &lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> are &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;generic&amp;rdquo; nouns that can
apply in &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rsquo; situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples of &lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> include the different &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> forms of &lt;code>ya&lt;/code>
(&amp;ldquo;who, what&amp;rdquo;), &lt;code>ta&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;he/she/it&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo;), &lt;code>eta&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo;), &lt;code>ima&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo;),
&lt;code>amu&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo;), &lt;code>kiṁ&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;what?&amp;rdquo;). One of the common usage of &lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> is as
&amp;ldquo;pronouns&amp;rdquo;, where they can assume all genders to represent
all things and persons of the different genders. But they can also function
as adjectives, adverbs, honorifics and interrogatives.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-nipāta-particles">⏏️ &lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code> (particles)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code> means &amp;ldquo;to fall. i.e. to be placed anywhere&amp;rdquo;, and refer to words
that can be found placed in the beginning, in the middle or at the end of
sentences and words, but not usually regarded as prefixes (see below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generally, the &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings of &lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code> words are elided as these words
are not related to other words in the sentence and therefore do not need to
be matched with them. {221}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in some instances, the &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings may be retained, if the
&lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code> word play a role in the sentence meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>tvaṁ &lt;strong>panā’vuso&lt;/strong>! tumhe &lt;strong>panā’vuso&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>you / (no specific meaning) / friend&lt;br>
you (plural) / (no specific meaning) / friend&lt;br>
&lt;em>How about you, my friend? And the rest of you (plural)?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>padaso&lt;/strong> dhammaṁ vāceyya&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>by word / dhamma / teach (causative, optative)&lt;br>
&lt;em>(He) should teach and say Dhamma word by word.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>vihāraṁ • &lt;strong>sve&lt;/strong> upagaccheyya&lt;/p>

&lt;p>to temple / tomorrow / should approach (optative)&lt;br>
&lt;em>(He) should come to the temple tomorrow.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following is a brief descriptive list of some nipāta words. Some are plain
nipātas without any affix, while some are with indeclinable affixes. Some may
even have a sort of vibhatti-ending in them or may still have traces of
vibhattis. Please note that the implied meaning of elided vibhatti still remains
in effect for some nipāta words such as &lt;code>yathā&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tathā&lt;/code> and &lt;code>evaṁ&lt;/code> etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>combination of &lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> &lt;code>ya&lt;/code> &lt;code>ta&lt;/code> with indeclinable affix &lt;code>thā&lt;/code>. The affix itself is ex- pressive of manner or mood.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>evaṁ&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>thus, in this way, true as it is said, yes (many meanings)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>dutiyāvibhatti, very frequently used in Pāli texts&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>khalu&lt;/td>
&lt;td>used mostly in a reported narrative&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>kho&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>mostly meaningless, but sometimes it may mean “only, really”&lt;/td>
&lt;td>a plain nipāta, found often in main Buddhist texts. Used together with &lt;code>atha&lt;/code> &lt;code>evaṁ&lt;/code> &lt;code>taṁ&lt;/code> etc.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>tatra&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>there&lt;/td>
&lt;td>a combination of &lt;code>sabbanāma&lt;/code> &lt;code>ta&lt;/code> with indeclinable affix &lt;code>tra&lt;/code>&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>hi&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>really, for, only&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Sometimes a meaningless particle&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>tu&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>in addition, only&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Also an expletive without meaning, sometimes added to be more emphatic in a statement&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>ca&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>also, too&lt;/td>
&lt;td>It is used to express some additional meaning in grammatical texts. Sometimes meaningless. Sometimes it has a lot of meanings when used after other nipāta particles&lt;/td>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>vā&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>similar to either or, in other ways&lt;/td>
&lt;td>In grammatical texts, sometimes it is used to express other option or method or inconsistency of a function. Sometimes with no particular meaning&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>vo&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>you&lt;/td>
&lt;td>It is sometimes a meaningless expletive&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>haṁ&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ahaṁ&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&lt;/td>
&lt;td>the use of these two nipāta are seldom found in texts unless it means “I”&lt;/td>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>alaṁ&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>(a) enough, (b) suitable, (c) worthiness, (d) appropriateness, (e) ability&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Also, (f) sometimes used as a prohibition or rejection, usually used in combination with (1) a noun in instrumental case, or (2) tuṁ-infinitive Kita verbs or (3) an āya-infinitive in dative case nouns&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>eva&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>equal to “only”&lt;/td>
&lt;td>used next to the word it want to modify or restrict or confirm in its implied meaning. A plain nipāta.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>ho!&lt;/code>, &lt;code>aho!&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>these are expression of interjection or surprise. No vibhatti&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>he!&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ahe!&lt;/code>, &lt;code>re!&lt;/code>, &lt;code>are!&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>“hey”&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Vocative nipāta particles, similar to “hey” in English. Usually vocative case vibhatti is applicable, but to be elided&lt;/td>

&lt;p>There are 20 &lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code> words which are usually applied as prefixes to
&lt;code>ākhyāta&lt;/code> (verbs) and &lt;code>kita&lt;/code>-affixed nouns (see below). Like &lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code>,
&lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code> words also have their &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings elided, but in some cases
where they are functioning as independent words (not attached to a verb or
noun), they may retain their &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three kinds of &lt;code>upasagga&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;code>dhātva’tthā’nuvattaka&lt;/code> - those that follow the meaning of the root, without affecting its original meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>dhātva’tthabādhaka&lt;/code> - those that absolutely mean opposite of the root. These categorically change the original meaning of the root.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>dhātva’tthavisesaka&lt;/code> - those that enhance the original meaning of the root by adding more specific meaning and flavour to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>parābhavo&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The rules for constructing a &lt;code>samāsa&lt;/code> can be complex:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fortunately, resources such as the
&lt;a href="https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/">Digital Pali Dictionary&lt;/a> can
deconstruct compound words into their individual words, which helps the
beginner to understand such words encountered. So there is less of a need to
learn the complex rules associated with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-taddhita-affixes-344-405">➡️ &lt;code>taddhita&lt;/code> (affixes) {344}-{405}&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Various affixes can be added to a noun to create derived nouns and adjectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare and contrast with English use of affixes such as &amp;ldquo;-al&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;-ly&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;-er&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;-or&amp;rdquo; etc. For example, &amp;ldquo;topic&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;topical&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;truly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In English, &amp;ldquo;navigate&amp;rdquo; is a verb, whereas &amp;ldquo;navigator&amp;rdquo; (with an &amp;ldquo;-or&amp;rdquo; affix) is
a profession. Similarly, in Pali, &lt;code>nāvā&lt;/code> is &amp;ldquo;boat&amp;rdquo;, &lt;code>nāvā&lt;/code> with &lt;code>ṇika&lt;/code> as an
affix becomes &lt;code>nāviko&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;traveller by boat&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;sailor&amp;rdquo;). Note that the last
vowel of the root and the &lt;code>ṇ&lt;/code> are both elided, and then the noun is given the
🚹👤1️⃣ vibhatti ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rules for constructing a &lt;code>tadhitta&lt;/code> affixed noun can be rather daunting:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>vasiṭṭha&lt;/code> + &lt;code>apacca&lt;/code> (Vasiṭṭha’s son)&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>vasiṭṭha&lt;/code> + &lt;code>sa&lt;/code> (👤6️⃣) + &lt;code>apacca&lt;/code>&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>vasiṭṭha&lt;/code> + &lt;code>s&lt;/code> + &lt;code>sa&lt;/code> + &lt;code>apacca&lt;/code> {61}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>vasiṭṭhassa&lt;/code> + &lt;code>apacca&lt;/code> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> (👤1️⃣)&lt;br>

&lt;p>Words with &lt;code>taddhita&lt;/code> affixes are sometimes not recognised by Pali-English
dictionaries, since these dictionaries may not cover the full range of possible

worthwhile learning how to recognise &lt;code>taddhita&lt;/code> affixed words and the associated

Note that the above tense/mood categories have been labelled with the nearest
linguistic term (eg. &amp;ldquo;present&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;past perfect&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;aorist&amp;rdquo; etc.) these
categories do not align precisely to those terms. I discourage the use of
these terms and rely on the Pali terms instead and the usage of each category
will be described later in this chapter.

&lt;p>Here is an example of the root &lt;code>gamu&lt;/code> (to go) with all the verb endings applied.
A number of transformations need to happen prior to affixing the &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>gamu&lt;/code>&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>u&lt;/code>&lt;/del> (elision of final vowel per rule {521})&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>m&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>cch&lt;/code>) (m→cch per rule {476})&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gacch&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example for transforming into the &lt;code>parassapada&lt;/code> (🟢), &lt;code>ekavacana&lt;/code>
(👤), &lt;code>paṭhama purisa&lt;/code> (🤟), &lt;code>vattamāna&lt;/code> (▶️) form:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>gamu&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ti&lt;/code> {414}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>u&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;code>ti&lt;/code> {521}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code> + &lt;code>a&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ti&lt;/code> {445}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>ga&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>m&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>cch&lt;/code>) + &lt;code>a&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ti&lt;/code> {476}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gacchati&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plural form &lt;code>bahuvacana&lt;/code> (👥) undergoes a similar transformation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>gamu&lt;/code> + &lt;code>anti&lt;/code> {414}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>u&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;code>anti&lt;/code> {521}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>gam&lt;/code> + a + &lt;code>anti&lt;/code> {445}&lt;br>

&lt;p>Note that some of the terminations are the same so in practice we will need
to distinguish which tense is being used from context. Note also the irregular
forms, particularly the aorist ones. The irregular aorists tend to be more
commonly used than the regular forms. This is so prevalent other grammar books
such as &lt;strong>Moggalāṇa Vyākaraṇa&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Rūpasiddhi&lt;/strong> created rules to accomodate
them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="voices">Voices&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Like Sanskrit, Pali supports 3 different ways of expressing sentences, based on
the &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the active voice (&lt;code>kattu&lt;/code>) {444}-{452}&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the passive voice (&lt;code>kamma&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the impersonal voice (&lt;code>bhāva&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>However, in Pali literature, &lt;code>bhāva&lt;/code> (middle, or impersonal, voice) is seldom
used, probably because most of the literature is based on the Buddha (or a
disciple) &amp;ldquo;speaking&amp;rdquo; to a group of monks, which has then been transformed into
a structure suitable for memorisation and chanting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-passive-verb-endings-vattamānā-vibhatti-440-443">🔴 Passive verb endings &lt;code>Vattamānā Vibhatti&lt;/code> {440}-{443}&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A passive verb is created by using the &lt;code>attanopada&lt;/code> (🔵) endings together
with an infix of &lt;code>ya&lt;/code> in between the root and the ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that passive verbs can only be formed based on roots that can be expressed
in a &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; (&lt;code>kamma&lt;/code>) sense - some roots can only result into &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; verbs
and cannot be transformed this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example transformation (based on the root &lt;code>paca&lt;/code> (to cook)):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>paca&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ya&lt;/code> + &lt;code>te&lt;/code> {440}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>pa&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>ca&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;del>&lt;code>y&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>cc&lt;/code>)&lt;code>a&lt;/code> + &lt;code>te&lt;/code> {441}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>paccate&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;is cooked&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="-causative-verbs">🟠 Causative verbs&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Causative verb in the active voice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Causative verb in the passive voice&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There 4 typical causative affixes (&lt;code>kārita&lt;/code>) used to construct causative verbs
{438}:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just like for &lt;code>tadhikka&lt;/code> noun affixes, the &lt;code>ṇ&lt;/code> is typically elided when joined
to a root, leaving the remaining letters. {523}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various vowel gradation transformations may also take place when joining the
affix to the noun as per rule {483}.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example transformation (based on the root &lt;code>paca&lt;/code> (to cook)) and the causative

represent the full theoretical set of causative forms that can be generated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-causative-passive-verbs">🟠🔴 Causative passive verbs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is also possible to construct causative verbs in the passive voice, just by
adding the passive &lt;code>ya&lt;/code> affix after the causative
affix. The &lt;code>ṇaya&lt;/code> and &lt;code>ṇāpaya&lt;/code> causative affixes are rarely used in the passive
voice.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="example">Example&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Here is a worked through example of how a root transforms into a &lt;code>kita&lt;/code>-affixed
noun (from &lt;code>caja&lt;/code>, using the &lt;code>ṇa&lt;/code> affix):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>caja&lt;/code> &amp;ldquo;to share generously&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>caj&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del> {521}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>caj&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ṇa&lt;/code> {529}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cajṇa&lt;/code> (&lt;code>kārita&lt;/code>) {621}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>caj&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>ṇ&lt;/code>&lt;/del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code> {523}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>c&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>ā&lt;/code>)&lt;code>ja&lt;/code> (&lt;code>vuddhi&lt;/code>) {483}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cā&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>j&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>g&lt;/code>)&lt;code>a&lt;/code> {623}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cāga&lt;/code> (noun) {601}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cāga&lt;/code> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> (👤1️⃣)&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cāga&lt;/code> + &lt;del>&lt;code>si&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>o&lt;/code>) {104}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cāg&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del> + &lt;code>o&lt;/code> {83}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>cāgo&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;charitable giving, sharing&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is another example based on &lt;code>budha&lt;/code> (to know):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>budha&lt;/code> &amp;ldquo;to know&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>budh&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>a&lt;/code>&lt;/del> {521}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>budh&lt;/code> + &lt;code>ta&lt;/code> {557}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>budh&lt;/code> + &lt;del>&lt;code>ta&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>dha&lt;/code>) {576}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>bu&lt;/code>&lt;del>&lt;code>dh&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>d&lt;/code>) + &lt;code>dha&lt;/code> {611}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>buddha&lt;/code> (noun) {601}&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>buddha&lt;/code> + &lt;code>si&lt;/code> (👤1️⃣)&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>buddha&lt;/code> + &lt;del>&lt;code>si&lt;/code>&lt;/del>(&lt;code>o&lt;/code>) {104}&lt;br>

→ &lt;code>buddho&lt;/code> (&amp;ldquo;The one who knows truth, who awakened&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the complexity of the above rules, it&amp;rsquo;s probably better just to
recognise the completed forms whenever you come across them, but try and
recognise the affix and associated meaning if you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-uṇādi-uṇādi-affixed-nouns-624-673">⏬ &lt;code>uṇādi&lt;/code> (&lt;code>uṇādi&lt;/code>-affixed nouns) {624}-{673}&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These are also &amp;ldquo;verb nouns&amp;rdquo; that can behave like verbs or auxiliary verbs or
future participles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The majority of &lt;code>uṇādi&lt;/code>-affixes, except some verbal affixes, are used mainly in
the formation of individual nouns of varying genders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sama&lt;/code> &amp;ldquo;to calm&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
→ &lt;code>sama&lt;/code> + &lt;code>tha&lt;/code> {628}&lt;br>

&lt;h2 id="sādhana">&lt;code>sādhana&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The process of attaching either &lt;code>kita&lt;/code> or &lt;code>uṇādi&lt;/code> affixes to create new words
is called &lt;code>sādhana&lt;/code>. Like &lt;code>kāraka&lt;/code> (the syntax of case or &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> endings),
&lt;code>sādhana&lt;/code> affixed words can be associated with specific usage meanings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sādhana&lt;/code>-affixed word can be associated with a voice (&lt;code>kattu&lt;/code>, &lt;code>kamma&lt;/code>,
&lt;code>bhāva&lt;/code>), in which case their usage can affect the &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo; of a sentence. This
is especially true when &lt;code>sādhana&lt;/code>-affixed word is used as a verb-noun, ie. it
carries the &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; of a sentence.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="exercise">Exercise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our first exercise, and also a celebration for finishing this chapter, is to
translate the &lt;a href="https://suttacentral.net/kp1/pli">&lt;strong>Saraṇattaya&lt;/strong> Kp 1 PTS 1&lt;/a>.
This is a very well known &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code> commonly referred to as the &lt;strong>Three Jewels&lt;/strong>
(also known as the &lt;strong>Triple Gem&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Three Refuges&lt;/strong>) and traditionally
recited by disciples of the Buddha as part of a ceremony by which one
formally declares oneself a Buddhist.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;br>
Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;br>
Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;br>
Dutiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;br>

Tatiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;br>
Tatiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by examining only the first line. Analysing each word by
identifying the form of the &lt;code>vibhatti&lt;/code> ending yields:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>🚹👤2️⃣(buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ) 🟢👤🤟▶️(gacchāmi)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
The notation used here is inspired by functional programming conventions.
In mathematics, we refer to \(f(x)\) as the function \(f\) applying on the
variable \(x\), so 🚹👤2️⃣(&lt;code>x&lt;/code>) means all words in &lt;code>x&lt;/code> are in the 2nd
case, singular (&lt;code>ekavacana&lt;/code>) and &lt;code>pulliṅga&lt;/code> in gender.
Similarly, 🟢👤🤟▶️(&lt;code>y&lt;/code>) means all
words in &lt;code>y&lt;/code> are present indicative (&lt;code>vattamāna&lt;/code>) active (&lt;code>parassapada&lt;/code>) verbs
in the singular (&lt;code>ekavacana&lt;/code>), &amp;ldquo;first person&amp;rdquo; (in English, &amp;ldquo;third person&amp;rdquo;)
form (&lt;code>paṭhama purisa&lt;/code>).
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Translating each word into English yields:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Buddha / refuge / (I) go&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Note that in Pali, all words in the same case refer to the same entity, so
both &amp;ldquo;Buddha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;refuge&amp;rdquo; refer to the same entity. In other words, the Buddha
is the refuge and the refuge is the Buddha. In English, we can regard the
equality as &amp;ldquo;Buddha as refuge&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, rearranging the words into a more idiomatic English sentence, we get:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I go to the Buddha as refuge.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For the exercise, translate the remainder of the &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code>. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to leave
words like &amp;ldquo;dhamma&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sangha&amp;rdquo; untranslated (and use non-accented characters)
as these are well known terms to Buddhists.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I go to the Buddha as refuge.&lt;br>
I go to the Dhamma as refuge.&lt;br>
I go to the Sangha as refuge.&lt;br>
For the second time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.&lt;br>
For the second time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.&lt;br>

For the third time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.&lt;br>
For the third time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Note that &lt;code>dutiyaṃ&lt;/code> and &lt;code>tatiyaṃ&lt;/code> are being used as &lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code>. &lt;code>pi&lt;/code>is a &lt;code>nipāta&lt;/code>
meaning &amp;ldquo;too&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;also&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sentence structure of this &lt;code>sutta&lt;/code> can also be represented as a pseudo
UML class diagram:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Congratulations on finishing this chapter! It is compact and dense, and not
every feature of Pali explained here will sink in initially. It may be
worthwhile revisiting this chapter from time to time to check your understanding
as you progress in your journey in learning Pali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is you now know enough of the basics of Pali to start reading
the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> with the aid of a good dictionary, and looking up every word
as you go along. You may encounter sentences that you can&amp;rsquo;t interpret very
well, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. Leave it for now, and study the next chapters, which
will help you build confidence and skill in your ability to analyse sentences
and deduce the correct meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember, the sentences in the &lt;code>Tipiṭaka&lt;/code> are often repetitive and used in
similar forms again and again. They are intentionally structured this way
to assist in memorisation and chanting. So, once you have learnt how to
correctly interpret a complex sentence, you may encounter it again and again
and reading will become easier and easier over time.&lt;/p>
