# Preface

## A Wholesome Pursuit

This work of translation was carried out with an aim and a noble desire to bridge the gap which naturally exists between the contemporary man and an ancient sacred language known as "Pāli".

The language of Pāli is like a gateway to the treasury of profound wisdom called "Tipiṭaka Pāli canon" expounded by Buddha. The study of Pāli, the spoken language of Buddha, is a worth-while and wholesome pursuit for anyone with a sincere heart and an inquiring intellectual mind whose apparent aim and purpose is to explore and understand Buddha's spoken words. By being able to understand His words, it will enrich knowledge and deepen one's wisdom thus leading to a much nobler and more meaningful life. Understanding the words of Buddha will surely bring a person much closer to the noble message of Buddha in its original tone, on the first-hand basis of the speech as it was originally spoken by Him more than almost two thousand six hundred years ago. When I first taught Pāli to some foreign students from 1997 to 2005, using some well-written guide books on the Pāli study, I found out that they can progress quite smoothly in the reading and understanding of the Pāli passages. However, they usually make a number of recurrent mistakes in their writing exercises. Though most serious students are able to understand what they have learnt to some degree, they still find it quite challenging to write correctly and flawlessly. The areas of weakness for the majority of students is in using the correct form of words with the right inflection, verb forms in the right place and the usage of participles and gerunds in the correctly arranged sentences. Pāli, as a matter of fact, is a highly inflective language based on its case and the role each word plays in a sentence of a contextual structure. Various word-

formations such as nouns, verbs and other essential parts of the sentence too are quite variable based mainly on the case, tense and syntactical role of the word. Unless one clearly understands how each word is structured and how they are syntactically related according to the role they play, one will not be able to gain mastery of the language and necessary skills in spite of making the best efforts in learning it.

## A Long-Felt Need

An earnest student with serious interest needs a very basic, thorough understanding and careful study about the structural patterns of words and their morphological process. This can be achieved only through studying its original grammatical text along with detailed explanations on the rules known as Suttas and the accompanying word-examples shown alongside in the Suttas. In other words, there is no replacement for an original ancient text with a ready-made, short-cut guide though it may fill some language-learning need but not in such a way as an original text can certainly do. An original grammar text written at a distant time when the ancient grammatical concepts and rules were conceptualized and formulated by the ancient sages, can clearly explain all aspects of the language and its grammar. The oldest Pāli grammar widely used and still extant is the one supposedly written by the most Venerable Kaccāyana. His grammar is a very-well written book, concise but lucid, compact with only six hundred and seventy-five Suttas1. It is complete as 

it covers all areas of the grammatical importance, ideally suited for any serious students of Pāli to study and master it within a short span of time. It is still used as a major popularly used grammatical text in countries such as Thailand, Myanmar and Sri Lanka where Buddhist scriptures are studied. To date, there have been two translations of the text. One is a French translation by M.E. Senart published in 1871. The other is an English translation of the Kaccāyana's original Pāli grammar text translated by Satis Chandra Āchariya Vidyābhūshana, the Professor, Sanskrit College, Calcutta and published by the Mahābodhi Society in 1901. Each Suttas of the text were shown in archaic Devanāgari-Pāli characters along with French or English translation of the Suttas and a few word examples. Both were nonetheless inaccessible to those who cannot read nor understand the French and the old-style Devanāgari characters.

Although both translations are neither a thorough translation nor a detailed treatment of the complete text, they were indeed helpful in providing some basically needed insights into grammar and served as useful guides and references for the students of Pāli for many years since. There is a long-felt need to have a more thorough and complete English rendering of the great grammarian's work so that it can benefit all those studying Pāli. This book is the first-ever attempt not only to translate all of the whole text but also to contemporize an ancient grammar and its contents for the contemporary world. I fervently hope that through such a detailed translation, it would surely be much more easier and more accessible to any 

student, regardless of various language backgrounds with the aid of a translated grammatical text such as this.

## An Eternal Tribute

Although this work is a not a groundbreaking work nor laying of a new foundation in the matters of Pāli grammar, it is nevertheless an important milestone in the Pāli grammatical literature. I 
humbly hope that this translation work will take the study of Pāli to a more higher dimension of advanced, in-depth study for all serious international students of Pāli. It will thus greatly benefit the students of Pāli in their study in many ways either as a basic companion guide or as an academic reference text at all times as long as their association with the Pāli study is concerned. I had started this work of translation as a token of eternal tribute to my great preceptor, the most Venerable Sayādaw Bhaddanta Sūriyābhivaṁsa (1879-1975), the founder of two great Masoeyein (Asokārāma) monasteries in Mandalay. He was also the chief presiding patriarch chairman of the great sixth Buddhist Synod held in 1954-56, as well as the founder of Pañcanikāya Sāsana Beikman monastery, Yangon, who has had nurtured me even while I was just a young novice. It is also a memorial tribute of deep gratitude to my late Pāli teachers venerable Kan-oo Sayādaw U Kondañña, (Lhaw-gar, Pale township, Monywa) and Sayādaw U Nāyakābhivaṁsa, (Masoeyein Taik-thit Monastery, Mandalay), to whom I feel greatly indebted for all the grammatical knowledge I had acquired. It is through dedicated care and guidance of such great teachers that I am able to share this translation work of an ancient sacred language with others. I feel that all the immense amount of energy, time and effort put into this important work will not be in vain, if this translated ancient grammatical text would surely and greatly benefit all serious students of Pāli in providing strong grammatical insights and skills they earnestly wished for. It will even be like receiving the greatest reward and abundant blessings for me if all earnest stu-

dents pursuing the study of Pāli would one day become competent and accomplished Pāli scholars of great goodwill who would selflessly serve the common interests and well-being of many in the human society.

# Preface To The Second Edition

It is not an overstatement to say that ancient India is not only the cradle of the Indian civilization, but also of four major religious beliefs; Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The profound wisdom, extraordinary talent and uniquely diverse and rich ideas of ancient Indian sages and scholars of various branches of knowledge have enriched the life, the language, the custom and traditions of people in myriad ways in India as well as in other lands of the East and Southeast Asia. Pāli is one of the ancient Indian languages used and spoken by Buddha in imparting his profound wisdom and daily teachings throughout his entire life. Buddha had taught his teachings on the basis of intellectual analysis and wisdom, not on the basis of either dogma or rituals. Knowing Pāli with substantial amount of mastery is the sure way to appreciate his teachings in its entirety. The learners of an ancient language such as Pāli or Sanskrit need a more simple and easy guide in their first stage of learning, a guide book free of any hard-to-understand technical terms and academic aspects of non-essential details. Every effort had been made to ensure that the English translation of Kaccāyana Pāli grammar is free of any complexity for both beginners and scholars alike. Since its publication in 2016, the first edition of English translation of Kaccāyana Pāli grammar had provided a convenient platform for the study of Pāli, paving the way for a more progressive and systematic Pāli and Buddhist text studies. 

This second edition of the Kaccāyana Pāli Grammar is thoroughly revised and edited to make sure that any typographic or inadvertent errors which might have escaped the scrutiny and careful proof-reading in the first edition are either rectified or improved. Some additional footnotes along with a few more relevant explanations are added wherever needed. In addition, a new note under the heading of "Gender Classification" is further 

added in the appendices section in order to provide the students with an important basic guide regarding the gender of Pāli words. The main body of first edition, however, mostly remained intact. 

I fervently hope that this revised new edition will provide all the students of Pāli and Indology with a simple and convenient guide in their endeavor to go deeper into the language and further develop necessary grammatical knowledge and language skills. 

## Acknowledgement

I would like to acknowledge my utmost sincere thanks to Antonio Costanzo who have made the most part of reviewing process. He reviewed both volumes of the text with great commitment and dedicated effort by going through every detail of the two volumes of Kaccāyana grammar text. Antonio had put a lot of time and energy into reviewing of the books with much patience and perseverance for which I felt eternally indebted beyond words and humbly inspired by such selfless help. My profound thanks are also due to Motilal Banarsidass Publishers for the vision and foresight to continuously enrich and enhance the wonderful heritage of ancient Indian civilization by having the English translation copy of this ancient Indian grammar text printed at their press and thus providing an opportunity to be shared with others in the world.

# Introduction

Historical Background The relationship of Sanskrit, **Pāli and Prakrit**
It is quite obvious that Pāli, Sanskrit and Prakrit have indeed common linguistic traits and close parallels to each other. These ancient languages, which belong to the Indo-Aryan language family of the Indus civilization, are linked not only in terms of geographic, cultural and close societal conditions, but also through some shared grammatical elements and inherent linguistic patterns. The intimate contact through daily interaction among people might have played a greater part in the development of such shared linguistics which resulted in somewhat interfused grammatical system. It can be logically assumed that the grammar of each respective language might have had appeared alongside since many centuries prior to or around the time of Buddha. None of them, however, were put into any record in the form of the written manuscripts but were rather passed through generations as orally transmitted grammatical trends. This might be the reason why the great grammarian Pāṇinī had made references in some of his Suttas to his predecessor grammarians. Amazingly enough, with the emergence of various belief-systems in the ancient Indian society, each language has come to play as the sacred languages of three main religious ideas among which Sanskrit became the sacred language of Hinduism and Vedic texts, while Pāli being the sacred media for all Buddhist texts and Prakrit being the sacred language of Jains and their religious texts.

## Pāli Grammar Vs. Sanskrit Grammar

The grammar or the science of language, had occupied high and honorable place in the ancient civilization of India. Having much grammatical skill and expertise is one of the virtues of being a respectable man of dignity among high social elites. The 

pursuit of grammatical study was thus a very respected trend of learning those days. Though there have been ancient grammars previously, the only extant and oldest Sanskrit grammar still in use is the one written by Pāṇini which is referred to as "ashṭadhyāyī". As the name suggests, it has eight chapters, with numerous Suttas (aphorisms or brief grammatical rules) totaling 3995 in all. Both Sanskrit and Pāli grammars have similar grammatical models as all have the same format of having eight chapters although the contents of each are distinctive and different in their own various aspects. The Pāli Grammar, the one traditionally believed to have been written by the great Pāli grammarian Kaccāyana is not totally based on the Pāṇinīan-system but an independent work which has its own style and character. Thus, there is significant difference and an independent way of presentation of the grammar. 

## The Grammarians Of Ancient India

In ancient Indian society, the tradition of learning any branch of knowledge including the grammar, is usually based on the oral tradition transmitted by teacher to student for many generations until modern printing machine was introduced into India at the turn of fifteenth century by the Christian missionaries. The study of grammar, even before Buddha's time, is pursued by social elites especially those belonging to the high Brāhmin caste. The Sanskrit, Pāli and Prakrit are the languages interwoven and intertwined into the ancient Indian society as linguistic threads in the matters of daily communication and learning among diverse communities. It is no wonder that the grammar of each language, as a result, have certain things in common despite having some distinctive features of their own in many respects. The following verses mention the name of ancient grammarians:

 (1) îN{íN{" k;xkOTSn;ipxlI x;k$;yn") p;i,NymrjwneN{;" jyNTy˛;idx;iBdk;"_  (2) îN{' c;N{' k;xkOTSn' kom;r' x;k$;ynm s;rSVt' c;ipxl' x;kLy' p;i,nIykm _
 $\overline{\gamma\mathrm{C}\Gamma\Phi\Gamma}$: !! 

According to these verses, there have been eight earlier grammarians (ādisabdikā) such as Indra, Candra, Kāśakṛtsna, Āpiśali, Śākaṭāyana, Pāṇini, Amara and Jainendra. In the second verse, Komāra (usually referred to as Kātantra or Kalāpa Vyākaraṇa), Sārasvata and Śākalya are extra names cited as grammarians. All those Indian grammarians are a mixed breed of scholars from different religious backgrounds. Among them, Candra
(Circa 400-480 A.D), Jainendra (Circa 8th century A.D), for example, are the disciples of Buddha. There was a verse of salutation to Buddha by the author Candra Gomin at the beginning of his grammar text which reads:

$${\frac{\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}{\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}}\ {\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}\ |\ {\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}\ |\ {\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}\ {\widehat{\mathrm{HHG}}}\ |$$

Those grammarians had lived in different timelines though some of them might have been quite possibly co-eval. However, it is beyond the capacity of anyone to deconstruct or reconstruct the past incidences which happened many centuries ago. As such, it is quite problematic to establish the exact order of timeline of these ancient grammarians and establish the correct biographic profile and the earliest seniority of one over another. 

Of those grammarians, Pāṇinī is the most eminent as his grammar is still extant and occupies the highest place of honor and respect among the grammarians of ancient India. In both aspects of linguistics and grammar, Pāṇinī's grammar is indisputably an outstanding treatise as it details the areas of word-formation,

morphology, philology, sound system and various grammatical rules. Despite unique attributes of linguistic ingenuity, Pāṇinī had undoubtedly adapted or incorporated the grammatical concepts of his predecessors in one way or the other. This fact is clearly noticeable through references he used to make in some Suttas of his grammar text to his predecessor grammarians such as Kāsakrtsna, Apisāli and Sākatāyana. Pāṇinī's "ashṭadhyāyī" grammar served as a seminal ground in which attempts either to gloss over his text or to reformat or to improve on his grammar are pursued by later grammarians. This had led to the development of rich grammatical literature of ancient India. Among such notable grammatical treatises written within the premises of Pāṇinīan concepts are: (A) a monumental commentary work titled "Mahā Bāshya" by Patanjali, (B) a more improved thematic treatment of Pāṇinī titled "Vaiyākaraṇa Siddhanta Kaumudi" by Bhaṭṭoji Dikṣetā and (C) Kāśikā Vṛitti (still an extensive commentarial work on Pāṇinī).

Also, another grammarian named Varadarāja, who is the disciple of Bhaṭṭoji Dikṣetā, wrote three grammar texts. They are:
(1) Madhyakaumudī, (2) Laghukaumudī, (3) Sārakaumudī, (an abridged, but well-presented version of Laghukaumudī). His grammars are arranged in a manner which is more thematic and easy to study, yet simple to understand even for the beginners. 

## Kaccāyana

Kaccāyana, like Pāṇinī, is a pioneer, the earliest-known Pāli grammarian whose work too either adapted or absorbed some terminology and fundamental grammatical concepts from the preceding grammatical sources he is well-conversant with. Even though his work cannot be said as a grammar solely based on the Pāṇinīan system and model, there are quite a number of Suttas whose physical structures or functions share some similari-

ties with those found in Pāṇinī's "ashṭadhyāyī" grammar. This does not mean that all those supposedly similar Suttas are totally identical in terms of both structure and function. Upon closer observation and careful analysis, some of the Suttas are found only to have structural resemblances to some degree but quite different in terms of functions. Some Suttas, as a matter of objective analysis, are found to have similar functions although the ratio of such Suttas are quite marginal in relation to voluminous numbers of Suttas contained in Ashµadhyāyī. 

## Kaccāyana And His Identity

The term Kaccāyana (kCc;yn or k;Ty;yn Katyāyana2, a somewhat differently spelt name due mainly to different morphological procedures which exists in Pāli & Sanskrit grammars) is a name of highly regarded disciple of Buddha. According to the descriptions in Buddhist texts, he was born in Ujjenī, into an educated wealthy Brāhmin family, whose father is royal advisor (Purohita) to the king. He is highly educated in all ancient Vedic and Upanishad texts and also highly skilled in the grammar. He later became a disciple of Buddha and well-known for his wonderful capacity to explain any brief sayings of Buddha in a way either to be in tune with or completely agrees with Buddha's original view. Therefore, Lord Buddha praised him and placed him in a special position of honor known as Eta'dagga (The most outstanding position) among disciples in a 

particular field of excellence in being able to correctly elucidate Buddha's short sayings into detail. In Apādāna'ṭṭhakaṭhā, II (the commentary to Apādāna texts which is like the biographic accounts about special deeds in the past lives of eminent disciples of Buddha), there is some remarkable account regarding Venerable Mahā Kaccāyana which reads: Attano pubbapatthanāvasena Kaccāyanapakaraṇaṁ, Mahāniruttipakaraṇaṁ, Nettipakaraṇan'ti pakaraṇattayaṁ saṁghamajjhe vyākāsi. Atha santuṭṭhena bhagavatā "etada'ggaṁ bhikkhave mama sāvakānaṁ *saṁkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṁ* vibhajantānaṁ ya'didaṁ *Mahākaccāno"ti etada'ggaṭhāne ṭhapito aggaphalasukhena vihāsi.* (Mahākaccāyana'tthera apādānavaṇṇanā, 54 Kaccāyana vagga, pp 213, Chaṭṭha saṅgā yanā Edition) 
[Translation] By virtue of his own aspirations in times of previous Buddhas, he (**i.e.** Kaccāyana) was able to outline and declare three monologues (texts) at an assembly of Saṁgha, namely, Kaccāyana text, Mahā **Nirutti** and **Netti** texts. Being satisfied on his intellectual prowess, Lord Buddha then honored him with the **"etadagga"** honor, a highest, outstandingly exalted position by making the following statement: 
"Of all my disciples who can explain whatever I have said briefly, Kaccāyana is the most outstanding of all". Having placed in such an exalted position, Venerable Mahā Kaccāyana, mostly lived a quiet and unfettered life enjoying the noble peaceful fruit (**i.e.** the benefit) of his enlightenment. Also, there are some discourses such as Madhupiṇḍika Sutta, Madhura Sutta and Mahākaccāna Badde'karatta Sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya and Uparipaṇṇāsa texts where Venerable Mahā Kaccāyana's detailed explanations won Buddha's unreserved praise.

In the light of such accounts from Buddhist texts, the author of earliest Pāli grammar can still possibly be assumed as a wellknown personality from the viewpoint of scriptural records despite some later academic opinions of different views. However, the two grammatical texts, (Kaccāyana text & Mahā **Nirutti)** 
which he was supposed to have authored, may have actually existed in the form of grammatical principles and relevant knowledge handed down and preserved through successive generations of monastics by means of the oral tradition only.

In one ancient Pāli record named **Sutta-niddesa**, the legend has it that the first Sutta of Kaccāyana's grammar **"Attho Akkharasaññāto"** which had served as the most important initial statement regarding the principle of grammatical necessity of a language, is attributed to Lord Buddha Himself. Those words which form as the first Sutta were supposed to have been said by Buddha as the brief outline of advice and reminder to two meditating monks who were meditating by the river bank, but whose minds were being distracted and wrongly uttering the words 
"*Udakabaka*-water and egret" instead of the right word "*Udayabbaya*-the arising and passing". Those initial words of Buddha, according to Sutta-niddesa, were further elaborated by venerable Kaccāyana. Thus, that elaboration and exposition process has led to the development of such a detailed grammatical work which commonly referred to as "Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa".

## Netti And Peṭakopadesa

Although the Mahā Nirutti text is no longer extant, The **Netti** (Annotative Exegesis) which is attributed to Kaccāyana's au-

thorship is still extant. Besides these texts, The **Peṭakopadesa** (the conspectus summary of the canonical principles) is likewise attributed to his bright authorship evidently traceable through Pāli records contained in both *ganthārambha* (the beginning section) and *Nigama* (the concluding verses) at the end of both texts with his name specifically cited as shown below: (a) *Soḷasahārā netti, pañcanayā sasanassa pariyeṭṭhi* aṭṭhārasamūlapadā, **Mahākaccānena** *niddiṭṭhā*
(The Beginning verse. 3 of Netti Pāli text) 
(b) Ettāvatā samattā netti yā āyasmatā *Mahākaccāyanena* bhāsita bhagavatā anumoditā *mūlasaṅgītiyaṁ saṅgītā'ti*
(The concluding words, the Netti Pāli text) 
(a) Aṭṭhārasamūlapadā **Mahākaccāyana***-gotta-niddiṭṭhā* 
(Uddāna Gāthā, Peṭakopadesa Pāli Text) 
(b) Peṭakopadese **Mahākaccāyanena** *bhāsite paṭhabhūmi* ariyasaccapakāsanā nāma
(c) Therassa **Mahākaccāyanassa** *jambuvanavāsino* peṭakopadeso samatto (At the end of each section called "*Bhūmi*" and also at the conclusion of Peṭakopadesa Pāli Texts) 
The Netti and Peṭakopadesa Pāli texts are replete with the most brilliant analytical exegesis and encyclopedic wisdom of the author. The texts themselves serve as the clear testament to the linguistic ingenuity and extraordinary broad level of wisdom of Kaccāyana. The grammar which he was supposed to have been elaborated is also unique in many ways. It bespeaks itself about the simplicity of Pāli grammatical system without any hint of delicate technical complexities. It was in fact concisely written to explain the basic grammatical concepts, the relevant terms and simple morphological procedures. Due to incomplete fragments of the records and lack of exactly coherent chronological stratification in such a remote time, it is nevertheless impossible to draw an exclusive conclusion on the true identity of the author. The fact that the author may be a re-

puted personality such as the one found in the scriptural records or just an obscure person of the same name who might have been much earlier or coeval with the author of Kātantra grammar or a much later one is an unsettled issue. It is still open for unbiased scholarly opinion and intellectual analysis. It is nonetheless beyond the capacity of anyone to exactly point out in a more conclusive manner by reconstructing incoherent and unreliable fragments of the past records and events which happened in such a long span of time except on vague terms of intellectual speculation and inferential hypothesis. 

It is almost logically as well as historically tenable to hold a factual view not based on inveterate bias. Among such views, is a possibility that there must have already been a Pāli grammar of some sort which might have existed not in the form of a complete text but in an oral tradition over such a long period of 1800 years' time spanning from the birth of Lord Buddha in B.C. 624 to the close of 1200 A.D, a timeline when Buddhism had flourished in the Indian sub-continent.

According to the "Indica" written in Arabic by Persian scholar Al-Bīrūnī (Circa 973-1048) and translated by Edward Sachau, some mention is made regarding the popular grammars used then among Buddhist communities. They were the one written by Candra Gomin and another non-Pāṇinīan grammar named Kātantra written by Sarvavarman, both of which were known to have been widely used among Buddhist communities. Candra Gomin authored Candra Vyakaraṇa, a Sanskrit grammar somewhat similar to the Pāṇinīan system but a distinctive grammatical work which has about 3099 Suttas. The author himself was a disciple of Buddha which he had indicated by the beginning verse of the text. 

Kātantra and Kaccāyana Some Western scholars, such as 3Arthur A. Macdonell had opined that Kaccāyana's work must have been based mainly on the grammatical model of **Kātantra** vyākaraṇa also known as Kalāpa or Komāra (authored by Sarvavarman) as the striking similarities, especially similar naming of the chapters, the names of Ākhyāta verbs and some similar Suttas are found in the Kaccāyana's work. To put such similarity in a clear perspective, it could be simply and obviously **a matter of shared fundamentals** of the Sanskrit and Pāli. Both languages have had inherent affinity to each other since the early days of their inception as the spoken languages as far as the Indian civilization is concerned. This nature of affiliation along with interfusion of the grammatical thoughts of successive generation of grammarians had resulted in such apparent grammatical similitude to a certain degree. Supposedly, Kātantra could had been a widely used grammatical text among Buddhist communities in India and Tibet for many years. Most scholars such as Sri Patidatta (!I pitdTt), Trilocanadāsa (i]locnd;s, the author of Kalāpa Piñjikā) and Durgasimha (dugRis'h, the author of Kātantra Vṛitti Ṭikā), an important commentary on the Kātantra grammar, were assumed to be Buddhist disciples in the light of the following verse written by Durgasimha at the beginning of his text "Kātantra Vṛitti". The verse clearly attest to it. Here is the verse: 
devdev' p[,My;d;w)svRD' svRdixnm)
k;tN]Sy p[v+y;im)Vy;:yn' x;vRvimkm_
If seen from the viewpoint of a broader intellectual position and unbiased objectivity, the nature of some fundamental similarity 

found in Pāṇinī, Kaccāyana and Kātantra can also be viewed as a kind of relative symbiosis, **not as complete similarity**. Most similar Suttas, with the exception of a few identical ones found in the Pāṇinī, Kātantra and Kaccāyana, are not totally identical with regard to the functions they enjoined or the meanings implied by those supposedly similar Suttas. This fact is very clearly noticeable and self-evident when one carefully delves into Kaccāyana's grammar and make a comparative juxtaposition and objective analysis. **The list of such seemingly similar Suttas,**
albeit being different in terms of contents and enjoined functions, are shown separately in the appendices section of this book in order of Suttas as found in the "ashṭadhyāyī" of Pāṇinī and Kātantra grammars. 

## The Talent And Skill

Regardless of various views with respect to the exact authorship, the Kaccāyana's Pāli Grammar text is a living testament to the linguistic talent, the grammatical skills and intellectual caliber of the author. He had deftly charted his own grammatical path by defining a more clearly distinctive presentation of the grammar uniquely independent of ubiquitous Pāṇinīan influences. There is no doubt regarding the fact that he is an accomplished as well as a competently talented grammarian who has had unquestionable mastery in both Sanskrit and Pāli languages and in relevant matters of the grammar. His grammatical work simply stands out of the shadow of predecessors and shines in his own intellectual light and in a class by itself. His linguistic acumen, the highest level of caliber and ingenuity as a skillful grammarian are clearly noticeable. Had Kaccāyana followed all which he had known in the Sanskrit grammarian models, even the initial preliminary section (s'Z;p[kr,m) alone would have become a sort of repetition. He had skillfully drawn the clear and fine line of a very important Pāli-grammatical core principle which he 

has formally termed as "**Jinavacanayutta** (the principle of conformity to the relevant usage in Buddhist Pāli texts)."
He had formulated this important principle in Sutta number 52 so as to steer clear of the procedures and linguistic nuances which used to be generally applied in the Sanskrit grammars. He had dexterously distinguished the natural physiology of Pāli words and its grammar by formulating new relevant rules, numbers, tense and moods, verb and noun terminations and simple morphological procedures. These facts are distinctive from the Sanskrit although he had adapted or integrated some aspects of the Sanskrit grammatical models. He had thus masterfully laid out a very simple, yet markedly different grammatical model quite uniquely exceptional in its own way though not totally dissimilar from that of the fraternal Sanskrit models.

These facts are self-manifest by the grammatical text itself. He clearly sees a very fine and delicate line which inherently exists between what is Sanskritized and what is not. This becomes even more noticeable when one goes into all the length, width, and depth of his grammatical text. One will, in the course of studying his text, clearly understand how difficult and delicate it will be for a grammarian to draw a very subtle demarcation between the two languages which have shared, though not totally identical, grammatical frameworks and linguistic norms. Unless he is a very consummate grammarian, it will certainly be impossible to formulate the rules and procedures applicable and relevant to the natural linguistic patterns of the Pāli. Instead, it will be a rebranding of the same packet with the same contents.

## The Distinctive Pāli Grammars

There are a number of Pāli grammars which were written by eminent scholars. Among such treatises, the **Moggalāna** Pāli grammar written by the great scholar monk named Moggalāna of Sri Lanka (Circa 11-12 A.D), is a distinctively unique Pāli 

grammar. With 1037 Suttas thematically arranged in seven differently named chapters, he had authored one of the most brilliant Pāli grammatical texts, unique in its own style. His text was supposed to have been mainly based on the Candra Vyākaraṇa4 of Candra Gomin. It was in fact a different grammatical work independent of Kaccāyana but seemed a bit Sanskritized in the physical structure of some Suttas and distinctive terminology of some functions, affixes and usage of anuvandha (conjoined techterms). The great grammarian Kaccāyana can rightly be said as a pioneering grammarian whose seminal work had served as a foundation from which various grammatical treatises of the Pāli language had later emerged. Among such ones is the **Saddanīti** written by the great Pāli scholar named Aggavaṁsa of Burma in the ancient city of Bagan (Circa 1157 A.D). The author of Saddanīti, could be coeval with Moggalāna. Saddanīti is indeed a very extensive grammatical treatise which is almost encyclopedic in terms of topic and contents written within the premises of Kaccāyana. 

Another grammar is **Rūpasiddhi** Vyākaraṇa (also known as Pada rūpasiddhi). It is a very unique grammatical text written by the great Pāli scholar monk named Buddhappiya of Sri Lanka (Circa 13 A.D). There are 672 Suttas with the exception of three Suttas viz. Samāse ca vibhāsa, Arahasakkādīhi tuṁ, *Sacajānaṁ* 

kagā ṇānubandhe, found in Kaccāyana. It is a very extensive, broad treatment of the Kaccāyana's work with a more systematic explanation of thematically arranged Suttas, a unique aspect of his grammatical text which proves the talent and wisdom of a true scholarly capacity of the author. A wider variety of relevant examples in each Suttas drawn from the scriptures as well as from various sources also added up to its uniqueness. His text, although he had said as being based on Kaccāyana's work, is in fact an outstanding work of the applied grammar written within the confines of Kaccāyana's grammar and had as such received much popularity. The style and presentation of grammatical lessons such as proceeding from the previous Sutta to the next Sutta, explaining the meaning of Sutta and elucidating the word structure and the relevant morphology of an example in a very pithy way, are innovative and informative which is not found in other Pāli grammar texts. Thus, it is much easier to understand and accessible for both teachers and the students alike. 

Following the style of Rūpasiddhi, is a concise grammar superbly written by Dhammakitti of Sri Lanka (Circa 1390-1410 A.D) 
which is called **Bālāvatāra**. The term Bālāvatāra means "the beginner's easy access". [**bāla**-the young person, **i.e.** uninitiated beginner+**ava-**down, being inside+**tara**-to swim, **i.e.** to access]. It is an abridged grammar arranged in a very systematic order of relevant chapters with about 420 Suttas, making it much more compact and concise in the structural design of grammatical text. The text has remarkable brevity and simplicity in imparting necessary grammatical knowledge and presentation of it in a more effectively brief style. Despite its small size, it covers all the essential aspects of grammar for beginners thus making it quite suitable for the beginners. In addition, there is another grammar which deserves respectful mentioning. It is **Nirutti Dīpanī** written by the eminent scholar monk Ñāṇadhaja Mahāthera, popularly known as the great Ledi 

Sayādaw of Burma (1846-1923 A.D). His text is based on the Moggalāna's grammar as mentioned in the beginning verses of the text. In fact, it can even be said as an improvement on Moggalāna's grammatical text as there are some complex points in some Suttas of the original text. It is an outstanding grammatical masterpiece written in a very simple and understandable manner.

As a matter of fact, there are considerable numbers of grammatical treatises written by the successive generations of Pāli scholars of Sri Lanka and Burma from 11 century A.D to the close of 19 century A.D. periods. Most of them can be classified into two Pāli grammatical schools as either of Kaccāyana or Moggalāna.

However, not all of those written treatises are focused on grammatical aspects. A few ones, such as **Sadda'tthabhedacintā** and Kaccāyanasāra etc., mostly dealt with some of the delicate points of the grammar and grammatical polemics. One can only be amazed and inspired by the development of such a rich Pāli grammatical literature in the history of Buddhism. 

## The Study Of Pāli Advantage And Disadvantages

Learning an ancient language such as Pāli has more advantages than disadvantages. The reasons are quite obvious. Firstly, it is no longer a daily spoken language. Therefore, it has not expanded over a long period of time spanning two and half millennium.

No new words nor any circumstantially emerged new terms are added through the passage of such a long time of Buddhism in its daily contact with the changing social, cultural and language patterns of everyday world. This does not mean that Pāli is a completely dead language which remains static. It can nevertheless be active and progressive like its cousin language Sanskrit when it is being revived and renewed by means of the relevant coinage of appropriate words and more added loan-words by the forward-looking academics. 

Secondly, Pāli, especially the canonical Pāli in the Buddhist scriptures, has a more fixed pattern of the style and usage in its coherent structure and modes of expression. Anyone with serious interest and determination, supported by the reliable source of guidance, such as a good book or a good teacher along with an effective learning method can progress quite smoothly and successfully within a short span of two to three years. There is no appreciable disadvantage in the learning process of Pāli for anyone. These two facts, that it is no longer a living language with an ever-expanding vocabulary and having fixed patterns of the structure, are wonderful advantages for a keen and serious student in his learning journey. 

## Why The Romanized Pāli?

When translating the grammar text, a common linguistic platform of the Romanized Pāli is deliberately chosen, instead of the traditional oriental scripts such as either Devanāgari or Burmese scripts. The choice of the Romanized Pāli is genuinely for the sake of reaching out to a wider base of the international students, not out of disregard for the tradition, nor based on any biased views and language preferences. 

All of the grammatical text has been translated along with detailed explanations, footnotes and tables added wherever necessary. Some grammatical points, which may seem quite complex to students, are carefully explained and simplified by means of a more simple yet easy to understand clarification and elucidation process. Detailed care is given to interpret and elucidate the essential meanings of each Sutta so that the students will easily understand the function and the rules each Sutta implies in addition to clearly highlighting the applied function on the examples.

Sometimes one may come across some of the redundant phrases and easily understandable sentences in its original text. Such instances of repeated texts are left as it is, in order to avoid pleonastic renderings. Of any translation work on the Kaccāyana's 

grammar, it is humbly hoped that this is by far a thorough and complete work as all the original text of each Sutta, along with its main examples, the split-Sutta functions, some additional expositions regarding the component words of the Sutta and related examples thereof, are translated and explained in a more simple and understandable manner.

## Dialectics And Simple Exegesis

The students will even find that studying and reading such an ancient grammatical text, which may be seemingly boring and monotonous, becomes quite lively and enlightening when they go through the question and answer sessions which used to begin with **"Kima'tthaṁ?** (For what purpose is this word, this function or this procedure?) and **Kva'ttho?** (What benefit is there?) etc. It is clear that the ancient grammarians did not lack common sense, tact or talent in imparting the grammatical knowledge to the students. They clearly knew what they needed to do in the process of teaching a language to enliven the interest of the students and keep them engaged in the learning process by means of including such a system of dialectics. Therefore, simple explanatory answers are given to each question in a detailed, understandable manner as it was traditionally taught by teachers. Thus, it becomes more clearer and understandable by practically pointing out the relevant examples shown in the Sutta. As a matter of fact, translating such an ancient text complete with complex linguistic concepts and some subtle grammatical technicalities through the medium of another language, is not an easy task. Needless to say, it surely requires resourcefulness, a lot of hard work, strong determination and an extensive research and references along with the relevant information from various sources. During the entire period of translating and preparing this book, various grammatical texts and other related literature written in Pāli, Sanskrit as well as in Hindi were extensively researched.

It is a daunting project fraught with challenges and pitfalls. Every effort has been made to avoid any inadvertent error or misrepresentations throughout the translation process although it can not be said as a perfect work. It is nonetheless humbly assumed as a thorough work which has been done in a more detailed manner as far as possible and to the extent of pertinent necessity. Any phrase or word of the grammatical significance is never left untranslated nor remain unexplained throughout.

## Traditional Pāli Script Vs. Romanized Pāli

Traditional Pāli written in Devanāgari or any Asian alphabet system poses some evident challenges for a beginner as there is no clear and visible separation of the vowel and consonant in its writing style. It is generally written by means of diacritical marks, add-on ligature and sometimes a dot. A dot represents "niggahita" in the Pāli grammar which is also called "anusvara" in the Sanskrit grammars. The grammars of ancient Indo-Aryan languages such as Sanskrit and Pāli, teach about a detailed system of metamorphosis of the words which occur among vowels and consonants. A student of such grammars needs to have the basic knowledge on the rudiments of such languages, a process which takes some considerable amount of time before the actual learning process can practically start. 

In order to easily understand this, the following basically differing writing styles of the Devanāgari Pāli, Burmese Pāli and Romanized Pāli are shown alongside. [Please note that there is no representation of an "a" as it is traditionally assumed hidden in the basic form of every consonant without any mark. Read left to right. Left will be referred to as "the front" while the right will be referred to as "behind, **after or the next"** in explaining the morphological procedures and application of a Sutta's function in this book].

[Devanāgari] k k; ik kI ku kU ke ko k'
$${\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}\quad{\overleftrightarrow{\Phi}}$$
[Diacritical marks which symbolizes vowels & dot]  n/a T T & $\gamma$
$$\mathbf{\hat{T}}$$
$$[{\mathrm{Burnese}}]\ \alpha\ \alpha\gamma\ \alpha\beta\ \alpha\gamma\ \alpha\beta\ \alpha\gamma\ \alpha\beta$$
[Diacritical marks which symbolizes vowels & dot]   n/a m d D k l a ašm H
[Romanized Pāli]Ka Kā Ki Kī Ku Kū Ke Ko Kaṁ In Devanāgari and Burmese characters, "a", the first vowel, is totally invisible. ā, **i, ī, u, ū, e,** o are shown by diacritical marks while "ṁ or ṃ" is **shown by a dot** on top or below the consonant "m".

Besides, the way of writing conjunct-consonants is quite a challenge for a beginner as it is written either horizontally or vertically. In Devanāgarī, it is written in either horizontal or vertical style using a truncated half-form of the syllable and add-on symbols. For example, 

$$(\mathrm{H})$$

(Horizontal) Kk(kka) K%(kkha) Gg(gga) G`(ggha) 

$\epsilon\leftrightarrow\epsilon$
Cc (cca) Jj(jja) Ll(lla) 
(Vertical) ˚(ṅka) ©(ṅga) Ø(ṭṭa) ´(ddha) ˆ(hna) and so on.

In Burmese writing style, it is also either in horizontal or vertical style. For example, 
(Horizontal) um (Kā) au (Ke) aum (Ko) 

(Vertical) ud(Ki), uD(Kī), uk(Ku), ul(Kū), uH(Kaṁ),   uU(kka), uQ(kkha), *ƒ(ggha), wW(tta), jENd (ndri),
$${\underline{{\mathrm{pa}}}})\;{\mathsf{T e I}}$$
$$\Gamma(\mathrm{gcha})$$
In the Romanized Pāli, the vowel after each consonant it accompanies, is clearly visible in a non-conjunct single combination of one consonant and one vowel. In the writing style of conjuncts, it is quite clear and simple without any vowel between two or three cluster-formation of the consonants. There is no need to use any vertical style writing nor any diacritical mark. This makes it far more easier for the student **to understand** some minute details in the process of morphological changes being taken place in a word as per the function of a Sutta's rule. Such ease of understanding will further make it even more interesting to learn the grammatical evolution process of Pāli words for the students. 

## The Rules And Role Of Grammar

When one starts learning a new language, grammar is a first step to begin with. **The rules of grammar are consistently established patterns of a language** discovered by the grammarians of sharp linguistic insight. As such, they do neither invent **nor** stipulate these rules but expound those rules in such a way that it would make a coherently understandable text for the student. The majority of modern Pāli learning guides written by the scholars, usually adopt a more brief, efficient, and abridgedform of the teaching method which may contain, if not all, necessary rules with the practical exercises. They may not cover all the minute nuances and some essential aspects which play more important roles in the development of grammatical insight and subsequent mastery of the language. They may not be able to offer more in-depth, detailed insight into the structural patterns of words in a way an original text of the Pāli grammar can possibly do. Take a look at the following sentences to clarify this.

For example, 

(a) Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa.

Salutation to that Lord Buddha, who has infinite glories, worthy of respect and perfectly enlightened.

Namo (Re: Sutta 104) Tassa (Re: Sutta 61) Bhagavato (Re: Sutta 127) Arahato (Re: Sutta 187, 127) Sammāsambuddhassa (Re: Sutta 61) 
(b) Buddhaṁ Saraṇaṁ Gacchāmi .

To the Buddha, I go (as) refuge.

Buddhaṁ (Re: Sutta 297) Saraṇaṁ (Re: Sutta 297) Gacchāmi (Re: Sutta 423, 476, 478) 
(c) Ekaṁ Samayaṁ Bhagavā Sāvatthiyaṁ ViharatiJetavane.

At one time, Lord Buddha stays at the city of Sāvatthi, in the prince Jeta's grove.

Ekaṁ Samayaṁ (Re: Sutta 307) Bhagavā (Re: Sutta 124) Sāvatthiyaṁ (Re: Sutta 216) Viharati (Re: Sutta 423) Jetavane (Re: Sutta 108) 
Note: The underlined points indicate the grammatical aspects. The numbers indicate the relevant Suttas whose rules affect such word-forms & structures.

Although one may roughly understand the meaning of each sentence, one may not yet thoroughly understand with respect to the structural patterns or the specific mode of inflection shown underlined as to why it is shaped like such and what it means etc.

An ancient grammar such as this Pāli grammar can give all the necessary instruction and insight into the fundamental aspects of the word structure and thereby leading to the development of strong grammatical skills firmly established in the students. It will take the student far beyond superficial level of the words to a more deeper understanding of how each word is built and evolved to play their individual roles and convey necessary meanings. To simply put, it will provide the students with a more in-depth understanding of the individual words so that they gain mastery of the Pāli words in the long term. This will further help them firmly settle in the good stead of the Pāli language. 

## 30 The Style Of Translation

Translating an ancient academic text is quite different from translating a simple narrative. It has to be simple and to the point so that it is easily understandable. Therefore, a more informal non-literary style of translation is applied for the most part of this translation although some literal "word for word" translations are added wherever necessary in order to elucidate some of the delicate and complex points. In addition, notes, some detailed explanations, tables and footnotes are added for the purpose of easy understanding and clarification wherever it is called for. For some Pāli-terms with ambiguous meanings, an equivalent Sanskrit word is shown alongside. Every reasonable effort has been made to translate almost every part of the grammatical text without making any exception to its contents. The purpose is to make students aware that a standard ancient grammatical text is a very broad and a very rich presentation of the linguistics and grammar conceptualized by the most bright and talented sages of the ancient times. There is a very visible element of dynamics in the whole text where the evolution of a word, or words as part of a complete language, are brought to coherent completion by means of injunctive rules of each Sutta and due morphological procedures. This way, each different Pāli word of various evolving patterns becomes ready to be used in a group of words known grammatically as a sentence. Moreover, a grammatical text also explains on genders, nouns, verbs, voices, persons and all the necessary rules regarding the applicable grammatical norms and standards though it may not be quite identical with today's contemporary grammars.

## The Grammatical Codes

When translating the meaning of each individual word, whether it be an example word without context, or a word with different structural components such as the plain nouns, compound nouns, Taddhita-nouns, Kita-affixed nouns or Ākhyāta verbs along with their relevant case-endings, a standardized, yet 

easy-to-understand grammatical codes of abbreviations is devised and added wherever deemed necessary. Without the use of such improvised codes, it would be rather futile and impossible to render a meaningful translation of such an ancient text. **It is therefore advisable to refer to the list of abbreviations section and necessary information** prior to studying this book. 

## Some Notes On The Romanized Pāli Alphabets "Ṁ" Or "Ṃ" Or "Ŋ"?

When representing some Pāli words, especially **"Niggahita**, the so-called **dot"**, it is used to be shown either as "ṁ" or "ṃ" or
"ŋ". In view of the grammatical norms regarding the "Niggahita", "ṁ" is more preferable as it is rather in line with its inherent nature of having a symbolic "upper dot" aptly positioned on top of the three short (rassa) vowels, such as **"aṁ,** iṁ and uṁ",
not with its symbolic "dot" down below. In the earlier publications of Pāli-related books, ṁ or ṃ are used to show it. Sometimes, "ŋ" is also found to be used by some scholars in the caseendings of words or wherever a niggahita is needed to be represented. All three styles are correct in its own way as it represents nasalized nature of the Niggahita, but it tends to be a bit confusing for the uninitiated beginner. In order to have a more standardized, uniform representation of the niggahita dot, only "ṁ" is chosen throughout this book so that the students will find it much easier to understand. As a matter of fact, a niggahita-dot can remain unchanged when the word ending in it is either an independent word by itself in a sentence, or the word itself has an integral dot as part of its structure such as **vaṁsa**-race, saṁgha-community (**saṅgha** is also applicable writing in case of a vagganta-function), **aṁsa**-shoulder, portion etc. However, when it is used as non-independent word such as the one being conjoined in a Sandhi-combination, it will have to change into any of ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n or m depending on any specific vagga-group of the letter it precedes.

Another confusable word is "b" which is interchangeable with "v". Please keep in mind that both can be assumed as the same as they are morphologically interchangeable though they have different sources of the sound. ["b" is labial, *oṭṭhaja* while "v" is denti-labial, *danto'ṭṭhaja*] 
Similarly, l and ḷ can be assumed quite similar as well as interchangeable although they have different origins of the sound as l is dental *dantaja*, while ḷ is palatal *muddhaja* (cerebral, also called retroflex). Other syllables of somewhat similar sounds, such as ṭ and **t, ṭha** 
and tha, ḍ and **d, ḍha** and **dha, ṇ** and n are also morphologically interchangeable although they have different origins of the sound.

## The Steps Of Effective Learning

The study of Pāli language is to be pursued systematically so that the student will progress smoothly and successfully. The first step is called "**Padasikkhā**-learning about the physiology of the words". The next second step is called "**Vākyasikkhā**-the study of sentences". These two important steps, when methodically followed, will surely set the student in a firm foundation of the grammar, leading him to develop the skills and ability to use the correct words in the right place in actual sentence writing and understanding of it. The first step of Padasikkhā, studying the physiology of words involves learning the Suttas, its meaning and the enjoined function and example words as explained in the relevant Suttas, along with studying their structural evolution through applicable morphological procedures.

When this is sufficiently done, the noun **groups** which have similar make-ups through similar morphological procedures, classified in the same gender and declension, are to be familiarized both orally and grammatically. This process is called 
"Nāma padamālā (the garland of Nouns festooned together) " study. Then, the **Verb groups** which share similar kind of affix, conjugation and the same shared morphological procedures are to be studied likewise. This is called **"Ākhyāta padamālā"** study. Having thoroughly and proficiently trained in these steps, it will lead the student to a firm grasp of the Nouns and Verbs and will further lead to the development of strong understanding, reading and writing skills gradually and effectively.

## Sub-Units Of The Grammar Study

In addition, all other sub-branches of grammar study, such as **(a)** word-analysis (abbreviated as WA), **(b)** Etymological Definition (ED) and **(c)** the study of structural morphology (SM) are to be included in this important process of Padasikkhā. Those wishing to have a more scholarly grasp of the language should include these sub-branches in their study so that the study itself becomes a multi-faceted and multi-disciplined approach for a more advanced, skill-oriented, in-depth learning. This approach of study is very effective in the development of scholarly skills and a thorough understanding of Pāli in its entirety. 

## Vākyasikkhā, The Study Of Sentences

The next step "Vākyasikkhā", the study of sentences, should be done progressively by studying suitable minor readings and a small collection of easy texts and verses from the scriptural sources. This will immerse the student in the actual language, keeping him in touch with the vocabulary of new words, various usages of both literary and figurative styles in addition to rich structural pattern of the sentences. With strong determination and persistent effort, the student should proceed studying the whole length of some selectively chosen short Suttas. It is rec-

ommended to start with the following: (a) Bodhikathā (It is a very inspiring account on the early days of Buddha's enlightenment) (b) Dhamma cakka pavattana Sutta, (c) Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta, (these are from Mahāvagga Pāli, Vinaya Piṭaka) (d) Mahāsati paṭṭhāna Sutta, (e) Dhammapada verses etc.

## How To Study The Kaccāyana'S Text?

There are eight chapters in the Kaccāyana text. The core of each chapter which forms the important part are a collection of 673 grammatical rules. The rules are further clarified by the Vutti and word-examples whose structural patterns are to be brought to completion by means of applying those rules. The rules are short and pithy descriptions of injunctions enclosed in a short sentence-structure called Sutta. It literally means "the thread" used as a measurement tool by the carpenters of ancient times for cutting the wood in the prescribed measures.

## The Components Of A Sutta

A Sutta mainly consists of three components. They are: **(a)** Sutta
(a brief and concise rule), **(b)** Vutti (explanatory sentences clarifying the rule) and **(c)** Udāharaṇa (applicable examples drawn from the scriptures) and Paccudāharaṇa (inapplicable examples). See the kinds of Suttas and the roles of each Sutta explained in the table below:

| No.   | Sutta Type      |                                                                                                                                                                  | Sutta Rule Classification   |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1     | Saññā Sutta     | outlines the formal terms and some basic  preliminaries of the grammar.                                                                                          |                             |
| 2     | Adhikāra Sutta  | influences the nature of other related Suttas.                                                                                                                   |                             |
| 3     | Paribhāsā Sutta | general announcements on the grammatical  outline serving as a general directive.                                                                                |                             |
| 4     | Vidhi Sutta     | enjoins various kinds of rules and procedures  to be applied in the Pāli morphology showing  the evolution of actual word-formation and  structural linguistics. |                             |

Of these four kinds of Sutta, **Vidhi** Suttas play quite important roles as they enjoin the rules to perform various specific functions and morphological procedures. The term "vidhi" means function to be carried out for completing the word. It is classified into eight groups according to the functions they perform.

See the table below to understand clearly.

| Types of Vidhi (functions)   |                                     |                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No                           | Name of Vidhi                       | Function                                                                                        |
| 1                            | Lopa (means to elide, to   delete)  | elides a vowel, or consonant or a  niggahita or an affix or a vibhatti  or even the whole word. |
| 2                            | ādesa (to change or to  substitute) | transforms either of above (vowels etc,) into different syllables. These kind of Suttas usually  have various functions, such as  changing the whole word into  another word-form, Vuddhi, Vipriyāya, Pakati, Atidesa and  so on, are also included.                                                                                                 |
| 3                            | āgama (to come and  insert)         | inserts a new syllable into a  word to become a complete  word.                                 |
| 4                            | dīgha (to lengthen)                 | lengthens the short vowel of a  word.                                                           |
| 5                            | rassa (to shorten)                  | shortens a long vowel.                                                                          |
| 6                            | patisedha (to debar)                | debars a specific function of a  Sutta as it is inapplicable.                                   |
| 7                            | paccaya (an affix)                  | applies an affix.                                                                               |
| 8                            | 5vibhatti (a vibhatti)              | applies a vibhatti after a noun or  a verb.                                                     |

The Recommended Order of the Study As a beginner, it is **not necessary to go through all the passages of the grammatical text in the arranged order of the chapters** although one may do so for the purpose of orientation and familiarization with each chapter. Begin the practical learning guide shown in the table by order of numerical sequence. Try to understand the meanings of various Suttas in the recommended order of chapters. Learn to recognize the enjoined rules and relevant examples. Then check how the enjoined function of a Sutta matches the way selected example words are being structured to become a complete word. Priority should be given to the recommended chapter sequence when studying Pāli grammar using this practical reference guide.

## Chapter One

In this chapter, Sandhi (euphonic combination of words) will provide the student with some fundamentals of grammatical terms and concepts. Sandhi is one specific feature of the ancient Indo-Aryan languages such as Sanskrit and Pāli. It is somewhat similar to the contracted word-forms in the English such as He'll, I've, etc. Sandhi is formed by combining two different words into one, so that verbal expressions are smooth and concise. Sometimes it may occur in one single word where multiple upasagga (prefixes) particles are present in its structure.

## Types Of Sandhi

Sandhi is usually formed through the union of vowels of two different words or one single word. Sometimes it may occur at the union of an end-vowel of the front word and the initial consonant of the next word. Sometimes it may occur at the union of 

a niggahita dot of the front word and an initial vowel or the consonant of the next word. In order to better understand this, one needs to know about different types of Sandhi. See the table below:
According to Rūpasiddhi, there are four types of Sandhi:

| No.   | Sandhi Type      |                                                                                                                      | Sandhi Formation   |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1     | Sara-sandhi      | union of two vowels, one being the endvowel of the preceding word, the other  being the initial vowel of the second  word to be united.                                                                                                                      |                    |
| 2     | Vyañjana-sandhi  | union of the end-vowel of the preceding  word and an initial consonant of the  next word in a would-be combination.  |                    |
| 3     | Niggahita-sandhi | union of niggahita in the initial word  with either a vowel or consonant of the  next following word.                |                    |
| 4     | Pakati-sandhi    | retaining the status quo of the structural  pattern of two or more words without  performing any specific procedure. |                    |

In the initial stage of study, unless one is a highly intelligent, sharp learner with a good memory, one need not try to understand everything. Just go through all Suttas, meanings, enjoined rules and relevant examples. One may test one's understanding by separating and combining the separated examples into a Sandhi on one's own. For the ease and convenience, a practical workshop shown as SM is provided in the first chapter.

## Chapter Two

A more intense and focused study should be made on nouns and verbs, which are like major building blocks of the language. In this Chapter, all information regarding word structure and declension rules of the nouns are clearly explained through relevant Suttas. There is an apt saying: "If you have understood nouns in their entirety, then you have grasped half of the gram-

mar" which is particularly relevant as the subsequent chapters of Samāsa, Taddhita, Kita, Uṇādi and Kāraka explain more about different noun patterns.

## Chapter Six

After studying nouns in the chapter two, students should proceed to the chapter six regarding main Pāli verbs called 
"Ākhyāta". The two chapters are complementary as they deal with nouns and verbs which constitute the fundamentals of sentence construction. The additional notes at the end of the first section of the chapter six are really quite important as they explain fundamental aspects of the Pāli verbs in clear detail. 

It can be said or safely assumed that as soon as the second and the sixth chapters are thoroughly studied, the student may have now understood some important facts on the plain nouns and basic Pāli verbs fundamental to a more comprehensive understanding of the language and its grammar.

## Chapter Seven

One should then proceed to study chapter seven on Kita-affixed nouns. In this chapter, the basic structure and morphological procedures of all Kita-affixed verbal nouns and words are clearly explained in more detail. Priority and more careful focus should be given to study Sutta Nos. 540, 555, 556, 557, 560, 561, 562, 563, **564 and 565,** to learn about the affixes which can be used sometimes either as main verbs or some auxiliary verbs such as the absolutive (also called gerund), the present participle and past participle. The majority of Kita-affixed words, except the example words shown in above Suttas, are just nouns structured with roots and affixes. Though a student may not at first understand the roles played by all these Kita-affixes, one will slowly and firmly understand about them later on.

## 40 Next Important Step

After one had made a firm grasp of understanding on the nouns and Ākhyāta verbs and some Kita-affixed words as explained in those chapters, one should start studying all those nouns and verbs together in a more practical mode of application. For this, Dr. Lily De Silva's book, "The Pāli Primer", or "The New Pāli course" by Venerable A.P. Buddhadatta and A.K. Warder's "Introduction to Pāli" are quite suitable ones to start with. These books will surely complement and reinforce the basic grammatical knowledge a student has acquired through the study of recommended chapters in the ancient Kaccāyana grammar text thus far.

## Chapter Eight

Chapter eight, **the uṇādi section,** is like an extension or expansion of the chapter seven which further explains some more about words having affixes similar to Kita-affixed words of the previous chapter. This time, however, with a different rubric known as **"uṇādi-affixes"**. The word "uṇādi" refers to the initial affix **"ṇu"** which has an ṇ-joined "u". [Re: Sutta 624, example words with this affix such as Kāru, Kāruko]. All the affixes shown in this chapter are collectively known as "uṇādi-affixes".

That is the reason why there are some Suttas with similar functions as those shown in the previous chapter.

Priority and focused attention should be given to Suttas 625, 626, 635, 636, 637 and 655 as there are explanations regarding some affixes which can be used as either verbs or auxiliary verbs or future participles. Most of the remaining Suttas are usually about nouns structured with root and affixes. The study of this chapter is quite easy if one had done a thorough study of the Kita chapter as both are interrelated. There, the student may even find quite a few interesting affixes such as "kta" and "**ghiṇ**" which may seem somewhat San-

skritized. In the Sanskrit grammar texts, the affix "ta" is termed as "kta (Kt)". The affix "tvā" is termed in Sanskrit "**ktvā** (KTv;)"
while "ṇī" is termed as "**ghinuṇ** (i`nu,Ò)." Also, the affix "ṇa" is sometimes differently termed "**ghañ** (`ñÒ)". These are just a few examples. Actually, the Sanskrit and Pāli grammars have different grammatical systems, morphological procedures and terminology even though they have some shared fundamentals occurred through long periods of affiliation, synthesis and shared ancestry in the ancient Indo-Aryan civilization. 

## Chapters Four And Five

A keen student, if he may wish so, can still decide to continue chapter eight or skip it to go back to study the chapter four on compound nouns and then chapter five on Taddhita-affixed nouns. These two chapters too explain **about nouns of different structure,** the former being two or more nouns conjoined in a process called "Samāsa, the compound noun", while the latter, instead of being joined with another noun, is affixed with a suffix expressive of distinctive meanings and consequently have some distinctive structural patterns.

## Order Of Suttas To Study In The Samāsa

When studying the Samāsa chapter, students should begin with Sutta 316, 317 and 318 to understand the nature of Samāsa. Then 319, 320, 341, 342 and 343 together to learn all about abyayībhāva. Then proceed to study 325 and 321 together to learn about Digu. Afterwards, proceed to study 329, 322, 323 and 339 to learn about Dvanda compound. Then, begin with 324, 330 and 332 to learn about Kammadhāraya compound. Then continue 327, 326, 333, 334, 335 and 336 to learn about Tappurisa compound. After all this is thoroughly done, one can start with Sutta 328 (Skip all the long compound structures at first go),
331, 338 and 340 to learn about Bahubbīhi compound. Later on, one should round off all the remaining Suttas to cover all of the 

chapter. This way, it will be more effective and quicken the learning process in a short time. As for the chapter five, just follow the Suttas as shown in this book under each individual heading of a Taddhita. No specific further recommendation is required. Actually, the study of uniquely-structured nouns in these two chapters is quite a fascinating learning-experience which can further enrich the grammatical knowledge of the student in many ways.

## Chapter Three

When sufficient amount of time and effort is being made to study the chapters four and five, one should start studying chapter three. In it, all the grammatical terms of noun case-endings called "Kāraka" and their implied meaning and usage, are explained in detail. Although it is termed as Kāraka-chapter, it also explains about non-Kārakas and unique case-endings which 

have exceptionally special senses along with the relevant examples.

Both Kāraka & non-Kārakas form parts of a complete sentence. They are syntactically related to verbs as well as to each other in a language structure formally known as "the sentence" and play their respective roles such as the subject (Kattā), the object (Kamma) or the possessive (Sāmi) and so on. It is not necessary to memorize but only required to familiarize with grammatical concepts, their relevant roles and practical application in the actual expression of verbalized or written language. To simply put, the chapter three, after all, is like a continuation of the chapter two regarding nouns.

The ED, which stands being abbreviated for the **Etymological** Definition, called **"Viggaha-vākya"** in Pāli (similarly termed ivg[hv;Ky in Sanskrit) is a process of expansion and explanation of the original example words shown in some Suttas. In chapters 4, 5, 7 and 8, the students will have to go through some form of grammatical sub-unit of the study termed EDs. This ED is an important feature which forms part and parcel of a complete grammatical text. The student, as a beginner does not yet need to study EDs in the initial phase of learning except a casual light-reading through all those translated examples of 

EDs and try to get some familiarity with it, so that one will get used to it later on. This will help a lot in smoothly moving through all the chapters without bumping into any hard-tounderstand word or phrases which may pose unnecessary challenge to the beginner.

Knowing and understanding the ED as well as being able to write a relevant ED of a word, is in fact one special characteristic of a true Pāli scholar. One cannot develop this skill in the beginning as it takes considerable amount of time and study. A student only needs to be able to understand its basic meaning and the resultant structure of a word by examining its ED. Therefore, it is not yet at all necessary to prioritize the study of EDs in the initial phase of learning.

## Three Kinds Of Eds

There are three different categories of EDs classified as per the respective chapters. They are: (1) **Samāsa-Viggaha,** compound EDs for those examples shown in the Samāsa-chapter, 
(2) **Taddhita Viggaha,** the ED of Taddhita-affixed nouns for the examples shown in the Taddhita-chapter, 
(3) **Kita-Viggaha,** the ED of Kita-affixed words in the Kita chapter and the Uṇādi chapters.

Of these three,
(a) **The compound ED explains** how each relevant noun is conjoined in a compounding process, using any applicable caseending of nouns, Upasagga or *Nipāta* particles, according to a specific category of the compound a word belongs to. Once a student can clearly understand its ED, he will then be instantly able to tell what kind of a particular compound the example word belongs to. 

(b) Taddhita-viggaha, **the ED of Taddhita-affixed nouns,** 
usually explains the base word and the implied meaning of 

its component affix by means of using relevant explanatory words or phrases. By understanding it, one will be able to dissect the complete make-up of a Taddhita-affixed noun in a very simple way. The student will also understand what specific kind of Taddhita-class it belongs to. 

(c) The last is Kita-viggaha, the ED of Kita & Uṇādi-affixed nouns. This kind of **Kita-ED explains** the meaning of the root of example word, together with the respective "Sādhanameaning" of the affix comprised in an example. It is in the ED of Kita-affixed words where so-called seven **Sādhana** are originated. Usually a Kita-ED may employ an Ākhyāta verb or a Kita-verb which is synonymous with the root's meaning in one of three voices to signify the relevant Sādhana of Kitaaffixed-word, either it be a Kattu or Kamma or Bhāva. Sometimes, a substitute verb with approximate meaning may also be employed in the ED.

If an example word belongs to other four Sādhanas such as Karaṇa, Sampadāna, Apādāna or Adhikaraṇa, it may use additional Sabbanāma-nouns such as tena, etena, **yena** (Instrumental case for Karaṇa Sādhana examples), Tassa, **assa** (Dative for Sampadāna Sādhana), Tasmā, yasmā, asmā, **yato,** (Ablative for Apādāna Sādhana), **Ettha, Yasmim** (Locative for Adhikaraṇa Sādhana) and so on. These additional words are called "**Sādhana-indicators**". It is quite interesting to learn about EDs and their role in exposing the structural dynamics of a word and its relevant semantics although one may at first find it a bit confusing and challenging. In consideration of the benefits a student can acquire through the study of EDs, it does not need to further emphasize nor overrate on its role. It is up to the personal capacity and convenience of the student either to pay some amount of focused attention or just pass it by through cursory glance. It should be noted that some examples may have an ED, while some words may be without it. If a student has made a thorough study and possess some degree of comprehensive knowledge of the chapter two,

six and seven, studying different kinds of EDs will not pose a problem. 

## Wa (Word Analysis)

The next important part is to have a firm grasp of Pāli words by clearly understanding its complete make-up (for Ākhyāta & 
Kita-affixed words), and the related name of Samāsa and Taddhita (for compound and Taddhita-affixed nouns). One can acquire this skill by studying WA, an acronym abbreviated for the word analysis. This, in fact, is not an original sub-branch of the grammatical study included in the text, but a latter-day development devised by the wise, far-sighted teachers of the grammar in ancient times for easy development of the necessary word-analysis skill of the students. If truth be told, a well-trained grammatical student should have this "WA skill" known in Pāli as "Padavicayañāṇa [**Pada**-word+
vicaya-analysis+**ñāṇa**-knowledge]" or "pada vicāraṇa [**pada+vicāraṇa**analysis]." Having this skill greatly helps the student to gain a high level of mastery on the Pāli words. It will also help the student to be able to build any form of correct and suitable word in the language with much efficiency and skill. Therefore, this word analysis feature (WA) is included in almost every Sutta of the chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8. **The students do not** need to memorize them at all but make some careful study of it so that necessary grammatical skills will gradually increase as the student proceeds through various chapters.

## 47 6Rūpasiddhi Or Payogasiddhi

(The Structural Morphology, SM) 
Another equally important part of the grammar study is understanding the structural morphology of words known as "Rūpa siddhi or Payogasiddhi." This is also a sub-branch of the grammatical study which can be said as already included in the Suttas but not in a complete detail under any formal name. As a matter of fact, Pāli grammar, like its cousin Sanskrit grammars, explains about the grammatical rules and brief morphological procedures with an aim to show how each word is basically structured and how it is brought to completion to become a coherent word by means of applying the functions of relevant Suttas. If seen from the perspective of objective analysis, the study of Kaccāyana grammar or other similar grammatical texts of the Indo-Aryan Languages, is the science of pure linguistics which may be seemingly quite different from the way modern-day contemporary grammars are structured and designed. 

This branch of SM study is a very beneficial process as it can strengthen the understanding of a Sutta and its related functions. It can also reinforce the knowledge and skill of understanding on the gradual evolution process of a word till it finally becomes a complete word. This feature abbreviated as SM is included in the first chapter of Sandhi but not in the remaining chapters for the sake of making this translation work less bulky and less challenging for the students.

Through this feature, the grammatical information as to how a separated Sandhi-example is recombined into a perfect Sandhi by applying the relevant function of each applicable Sutta, is clearly explained in a step-by-step detail. The study of Rūpasiddhi may not be possible without the aid of a truly competent teacher or a reliable guidebook, such as the one written by the late *Tha-bye-kan* Sayādaw Bhaddanta Ukkaṁsācāra, a very well-known, highly respected, Pāli, Hindi, and Sanskrit scholar of Burma. In the days gone-by in countries where the study of Pāli is pursued in a more strict systematic manner, this step along with memorization of the whole of Kaccāyana text, is a necessity and always emphasized. Those who have had included this sub-branch in their study, become very competent Pāli students and scholars. 

## Footnotes

There are important additional notes inserted in the form of footnotes wherever necessary. They are intended to be part of the required readings for all keen students as they contain essential information for the development of overall grammatical knowledge and the skills. Therefore, it need not be further emphasized to be part of an inclusive study regimen for all serious students.

## Appendix

There is also an appendix section at the end of the book which provides some essentially necessary grammatical information for the serious student. The sample morphology, the Kāraka & Sādhana and the Pāli-root index are some of the subtle areas of grammatical skills and study. Proceeding through those sections will not only enrich but also broaden the scope of understanding and the grammatical knowledge. Therefore, it is encouraged to read the appendices section. 

## 49 Generalized Understanding

When studying an ancient language such as Pāli, it is quite necessarily important to have a balanced as well as relaxed attitude toward the subject of study. One should neither push oneself too much nor be inert. So, there are two scenarios and choices. One is a casual student whose aim and purpose is only to be able to read and understand Pāli to some degree. The other is a serious student with keen interest, whose aim is not only to be able to read and understand, but also to be able to write the flawless Pāli by gaining some substantial amount of mastery on it. For both of them, having a generalized understanding of the subject is the first necessary step and an important key to further progress which one has to decide for a more intensive and progressively detailed study. Therefore, students should start their study by going through various Suttas in the recommended order of the chapters, try to understand their meanings, the enjoined rules and relevant examples as shown in each translation. Then check how the enjoined function of a Sutta matches the way example words are accordingly structured and completed. If the student finds that what one has learned is as it is explained in the Sutta, then it can be assumed that one has been coming along well and made some progress in the first step. The students will surely have some degree of understanding of whatever is read and studied and thus be ready to progress much further. It is not at all necessary to understand everything in the text even though having a more substantial way of understanding is far more preferable than having a vague understanding. It is sincerely and firmly hoped that with strong determination, consistent efforts combined with graduated steps of the study, students will certainly progress in the learning process of Pāli in a minimum span of two to three years. This is what this English translation work is specifically and mainly intended for.

# Pronunciation Guide

## The Eight Vowels

Except a few special ones unique to Pāli, the majority of ordinary Pāli alphabets are pronounced like basic normal sound of English words. The following are the sample sounds of individual vowels. Please take only the sound of underlined words, not of the whole word nor of any consonant.

(1) a to be pronounced as in amid, about (2) ā to pronounce as in far
(3) i as in meet, eat
(4) ī as in we, he (5) u as in shoot
(6) ū as in you, beauty
(7) e as in way
(8) o as in all, auto

## The Consonants

There is an "a" after each consonant which is added for easy utterance or producing an articulate sound of the respective consonants. There are five groups comprising five consonants in each which is called "vagga". On the other hand, there are non-vagga consonants comprising seven consonants and one niggahita.

## Ka-Group

This group of consonants are velar (guttural).

Note: In each group, every **second and fourth** consonants are aspirated. As a physical sign, there is an "h" which symbolizes the stress. So, it has to be pronounced with the stress and a puff of air being released.

The first and the third are unaspirated. So, they are pronounced normally without stress. **The fifth** ones in each vagga-group are nasals.

(1) Ka as in Kab (2) Kha as in khaki, khmer
(3) Ga as in glad
(4) Gha as in ghat (5) Ṅa as in sing, John Ng

## 51 Ca-Group

This group of consonants are palatal.

(1) Ca as in Ciao (Italian greeting word) (2) Cha as in Charge, charity (3) Ja as in jab (4) Jha as in jack Note: See en.oxforddictionaries.com for the sound of "Ciao." There is a slight variation of the sound for both "**J and** Jh" which are pronounced as "za" and "zha" in Burmese.

(5) Ña as in Lasagna, signor, signora (It is a nasal sound) 

## Ṭa-Group

This group of consonants are retroflex, to be pronounced with the tongue being pulled backward away from the teeth and slightly touching the upper palate. (1) Ṭa as in tea (2) Ṭha as in train (3) Ḍa as in disc (4) Ḍha as in dart (5) Ṇa as in Nagoya

## Ta-Group

This group of consonants are dental, to be pronounced with the tip of tongue touched against upper teeth or the ridge behind the upper teeth. (1) Ta as in tachometer (2) Tha as in try or train (3) Da as in daffodil (4) Dha as in dark (5) Na as in nab

## Pa-Group

This group of consonants are labial, to be pronounced with lips gently touched against each other and then quickly opened. (1) Pa as in pacific

(2) Pha as in Facility, phacelia (3) Ba as in basalt (4) Bha as in bath (5) Ma as in macau

## Seven Non-Vagga Group Consonants

(1) Ya as in yacht, yak (2) Ra as in rabbit (3) La as in lab (to be pronounced with the tip of tongue gently touching the upper teeth.) 
(4) Ḷa as in lasagna (Actually, this is very much the same as ordinary "la"). To be pronounced with the mouth being slightly opened, with the tip of tongue slightly touching the upper palate.

Note: This is one special "Ḷ" with a different dot down below which is unique only to Sanskrit and Pāli. In the grammatical texts, it is mentioned as being homogenous and interchangeable with ordinary "L" despite having slight physical difference.

(5) Wa as in warp, vat (Both sounds of **w & v** are permissible) 
Note: In the grammatical text, there will be more of "v" such as "kvaci, vā and so on" though it is rather pronounced as "w" in majority of cases. 

For example, the word "Kvaci" is pronounced as Kuaci or **kwaci**, while 
"vā" is sounded as wā. In Asian syllabary such as Devanāgari and Burmese, there are only two representations of "v & w". For example, "v" is shown as "b-A" while "w" is written as "v-0". However, in Romanized Pāli, "v" is sometimes represented as "b" while "w" is shown by both ways either as "v" or "w". Therefore, keep in mind that all these three of 
"**b, v & w**" are basically as well as morphologically homogenous to each other. This fact will become even clearer when studying the morphological procedures of the Pāli words which comprise either "v" or "w".

## One Sibilant

(6) Sa as in sabbath One Aspirate sound
(7) Ha as in habit, half

## 53 Niggahita Dot

This Niggahita "upper-dot" is semi-vowel as well as a semiconsonant though it is classified as a byañjana, (**i.e.** consonant in the grammatical text) (1) ṁ as in am Note: This "ṁ" is interchangeable with all the fifth syllables "**ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, m**"
of the five vagga-groups through applicable morphological procedure. This means that "ṁ" can change into any consonant form of "ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, m". These fives are called "vagganta" which means the group-endings [**vagga**-group+ anta-ending]. Sometimes, it is also referred to as "five nasal stops".

# Guide To Conjuncts

A conjunct is a cluster of consonants combined together by being based on a single vowel. Such a structure is technically called "saṁyoga" in grammatical term. Most conjuncts in Asian languages are written either in horizontal or vertical structure
(Refer to the preface of this book). Depending on how it is written, one has to read it from left to right or up to down. In Romanized Pāli, it is written in horizontal style which is much easier to read from left to right. [saṁyoga=saṁ-together+**yoga**-to bind, to join, i.e. being joined together, conjunct]
There are two types of conjuncts: (a) conjuncts of similar consonants,
(b) conjuncts of dissimilar consonants.

Of the two, conjuncts of similar consonants usually occur: (1) in the first and third consonants of five vagga-groups, (2) also in the last four "ñ, ṇ, n, m" of five vagga-group with the exception of "ṅ" of Ka-group. Of non-vagga consonants, conjuncts also occur in y, l, w, s. There are **no conjuncts of similar consonants found to be combined with** the four consonants "ṅ, r, ḷ, h". This kind of conjunct is formed due mainly to:
(a) the rule of Sutta No. 28, (b) other applicable morphological procedures, and (c) the natural structure of the word itself. **One of these three** 
causes lead to the formation of conjuncts of similar consonants.

Conjuncts of similar consonants Vagga-group similar conjuncts
(Ka-group) kka, gga, (Ca group) cca, jja, ñña, (Ṭa group) ṭṭa, ḍḍa, ṇṇa, (Ta group) tta, dda, nna, (Pa group) ppa, bba, mma,

## Non-Vagga Group Similar Conjuncts

yya, lla, vva, (Being morphologically homogenous and interchangeable, it is also sometimes written as bba), ssa,

## Conjuncts Of Dissimilar Consonants

As for the conjuncts of dissimilar consonants, it used to occur in the second, fourth and the fifth of vagga-group consonants. However, this explanation is only about general patterns from the grammatical perspective, not a complete description. There are diverse varieties of anomalous conjunct-formation of dissimilar consonants found in the Pāli texts caused and mainly influenced by: 
(a) the rule of Sutta No. 29, (b) other relevant applicable morphological procedures, and (c) the natural structure of the word itself. One of these three causes may lead to the formation of such conjuncts of dissimilar consonants. The following is a list of such dissimilar conjuncts found in various Pāli literature. By studying the list carefully, one will easily understand how these conjunct-words are formed.

## Vagga Conjuncts

(1st vagga) kkha, ggha (2nd Vagga) ccha, jjha (3rd Vagga) tṭha, ḍdha (4th Vagga) ttha, ddha (5th Vagga) ppha, bbha (Refer to function of Sutta No. 29) 
The following conjuncts are formed by joining the last of vagga with its own group. Please carefully study so that it becomes 

much easier to understand some of the fixed pattern of such dissimilar conjuncts. Actually, this pattern is as what is described in the rule of Sutta number 31. (Conjuncts with the last alphabet "ṅ" of 1st Vagga) ṅka, ṅkha, ṅga, ṅgha (Conjuncts with the last alphabet "ñ" of 2nd Vagga) ñca, ñcha, ñja, ñjha (Conjuncts with the last alphabet "ṇ" of 3rd Vagga) ṇṭa, ṇṭha, ṇḍa, ṇḍha (Conjuncts with the last alphabet "n" of 4th Vagga) nta, ntha, nda, ndha (Conjuncts with the last alphabet "m" of 5th Vagga) mpa, mpha, mba, mbha

## Non-Vagga Conjuncts

1. Dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "ya" (This type of conjuncts with "ya" are usually found in the grammatical texts) 
(1st) kya, khya, gya, (2nd) cya, (3rd) ṭya, ḍya, ṇya (4th) tya, thya, dya, dhya, nya (5th) pya, phya, bya & vya, bhya, mya (nonvagga) lya, sya, Dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "ra"
(1st) kra, kri, (4) tra, tri, dra, dri (5) bru (with non-vagga "sa" & "ta") stra 3. Two dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "la"
(1st) kla (5th) pla 4. Eight dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "va" kva, khva, ṇva, tva, dva, nva (Non-vagga) sva, hva 5. One dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "sa" sta as in Usto-shocked.

5. Nine Dissimilar conjuncts with non-vagga "ha" ñha, ṇha, nha, mha, 
(Non-vagga) yha, rha, lha, vha, ḷha,

## Triple Conjuncts

Note: Triple conjuncts are quite rarely found except a few words. 

(1) ndri as in Indriya-faculty. (2) ntvā as in Gantvā-having gone Note: There is no quadri-conjuncts found in the texts. Keep in mind that these shown above are only a common list of conjuncts which used to be found in a wider source of Pāli literature, not a limitation of other possible 

forms of conjuncts. As a general rule of grammar, any acceptable conjunct coined within the confines of grammatical logic and relevant morphological applicability is still possible depending on the skill and discretion of the author. "Paṭādīhyalaṁ, Cyādīhi Īvaro, Sasvādīhi tudavo (See the underlined conjuncts)" are such examples among applicable possibilities found in this gammatical text.

## Vowel Conjuncts?

 In Sanskrit, there are some vowels such as Ew , a*, classified as diphthongs. But in Pāli, there are absolutely no such vowels. The vowels are like foundations where generally one or two or three consonants are based to produce a clear, well-articulated sound. In order to produce such sound of an individual consonant or two to three consonants in a cluster-formation, one vowel alone is sufficient. The rules of Suttas 12 & 83 clearly indicate this fixed linguistic pattern of morphology as stipulated in the Pāli grammatical texts.

# Frequently Found Words

ādeso-to change, **i.e.** the function applicable by the rule of Sutta. āpajjate, āpajjante-literally it means "to reach a morphologically changed state of". āv.

Iti-This word serves as:
(a) indicative, which means "as, thus". Usually found after the very word it emphatically indicates. e.g. *Yutte'ti Kasmā?* [yutte+iti kasmā, Sutta No.11]
Why is this word as "Yutte" said here?

(b) a disjunctive which is expressive of the end of a section, usually found at the end of a section or a chapter.

Having bowed down to the Buddha, the most praised, Honored by three worlds of human, divine beings and Brahmā (Gods), And the holiest of the world, To the sacred Dhamma and the noble Saṅgha. I will expound the grammar (starting with) the good chapter of Sandhi-section For easily understanding of the sacred words of Buddha, to benefit (those studying) Buddhist scriptures.

(b) Seyyaṁ jine'ritanayena budhā labhanti, Tañ'cā'pi tassa vacana'tthasubodhanena, atthañ'ca akkharapadesu amohabhāvā, seyya'tthiko padamato vividhaṁ suṇeyya. The wise realize the supreme happiness, In the way as taught by the Lord Buddha.

That way is to be acquired only through a good understanding of the meaning of the sacred words and by being free from any confusion on the meaning of the sacred words. Therefore, anyone aspiring to attain supreme happiness, should learn the grammar about various words.

What is the benefit by mentioning "niggahita"? It has the benefit of ease of reference in Suttas such as "Aṁ byañjane niggahitaṁ". Summary: This Sutta names one nasalized "aṁ" as the "niggahita". See the footnote.

9 A **Niggahita** is represented by the consonant "ṁ" in the Romanized Pāli. It is called "Niggahita" as it has to be uttered or sounded out through nasal passage by having the necessary parts of the mouth which serve as a mechanism of the speech or spoken sound such as lip etc, gently pressed while at the same time other parts such as tongue, teeth, etc, remain inactive during the enunciation process. [Niggahīta=ni√gaha+ta] [Reference Text] Rassasaraṁ nissāya gayhati, *karaṇam niggahetvā* gayhatī'ti vā niggahitaṁ.

(Translation) It is called Niggahita as it is uttered being based on short vowels, also because it is spoken with the act of enunciation (karaṇa) the sources of voice (**ṭhāna**) being repressed. Here, the root "gaha" prefixed with an upasagga particle "ni" means to press and to restrain.

Karaṇaṁ Niggahetvāna, mukhenā'vivaṭena'yaṁ Vuccate niggahita'nti, Vuttaṁ Bindhusarā'nugaṁ. (Rūpasiddhi) 
(Translation) This sound of dot is said by restrained act of utterance, with mouth (lips) kept unopened. So, this "dot" is called "niggahita" which used to depend on (three) short vowels. In Thai, Burmese and Devanāgari alphabets, it is usually represented by a small dot on top of the letters it joined. See these following sample words:
Thaiอํ, Burmese tH, Devanāgari SM .

The niggahita is usually found joined on top of only three rassa (short) vowels "**a, i, u".** It is called an "anusvāra" in Sanskrit. Some grammarians view it as a semi-vowel as well as a semi-consonant as it is interchangeable in the morphological procedure of Pāli grammar. Please note that only "ṁ" is called Niggahita while "a" is added for the purpose of easy utterance.

There, when wanting to conduct the grammatical procedure of Sandhi (Euphonic combination of words), the preceding front consonant has to be put below and make it vowel-less by separating it from its attached vowel and keep the separated vowel above. For example, "• Tatrā'ya'mādi" Summary: This Sutta sets the rule **to separate the consonant from vowel** it is attached to before performing any morphological procedure such as eliding, shortening, lengthening or changing into other forms of syllables etc., can be carried out properly. The functions prescribed in Sutta 10 and 11 are two important fundamental procedures of the morphology in the Pāli grammar.

Example: **Tatrā'ya'mādi.**
(Here, three words "Tatra, ayaṁ and ādi", are combined in a Sandhi).

See ' **the apostrophe marks** shown as **a sign of Sandhi**). In this example, the point of Sandhi is shown by apostrophe mark '. Please carefully note this mark as all sign of Sandhi will be shown by this mark throughout this book. Note that there are two points of Sandhi in this example, one between **trā'ya** and the other between ya and mā. Now, it will look like this when all the combined words are separated:

## Tatra+Ayaṁ+Ādi

(3 words. 2 Point of Sandhi being separated are shown by + sign) 
[**Tatra-**at that Nibbāna. **ayaṁ-**this four kind of purity. **ādi-**is the beginning]
Note: The separation process of consonant from vowel as prescribed by this Sutta may seem quite irrelevant in Romanized letters as they are already separated. In Pāli written in Devanāgari or in Burmese etc., it is quite relevant and necessary as the vowels are usually written by being joined in one single 

letter comprising both a vowel and a consonant such as ik" kI" ku" kU" ud˜ uD˜
uk˜ ul. In these sample words, the diacritical marks symbolize vowels which need to be separated.

The vowel-less consonant being kept below, should be reattached to the rear (next) letter when appropriate. (**i.e.** after all due morphological procedures have been done).

Summary: This Sutta sets the rule **to re-attach the separated consonant to the next vowel** after any necessary morphological procedure such as eliding, shortening, lengthening have been done.

Below is an example of Sandhi. Note that there are two (') apostrophe marks which show point of Sandhi. 

[CS] - Tatrā'bhirati'miccheyya. (3 words, CS means combined in Sandhi) 
(Meaning) **Tatra-**at that three kind of tranquility. **abhiratiṁ-**joy. 

iccheyya-(one) should prefer. **i.e.** One should prefer enjoying at that three kind of tranquility, peace.

[SS] Tatra+abhiratiṁ+iccheyya. (SS means Sandhi Separated, 3 words) 
Morphological Explanation of Example [ME]
[ME] Here, Sandhi is between two points where bold-faced letters with a plus sign are shown.

The steps to make these separated words of Sandhi to be recombined into a perfect Sandhi.

Now let's study **the necessary morphological procedures** on the first point of Sandhi: (1) First the initial "a" in front of the plus sign is to be elided as per Sutta 12. It then looks like this: Tatr+abhiratiṁ+iccheyya.

(2) Then the next "a" is to be lengthened by procedure as prescribed in Sutta 15. It now becomes > Tatr+ābhiratiṁ+iccheyya. 

(3) By procedure of this Sutta 11, the vowel-less "r" is then to be attached to next lengthened "ā" > Tatrābhiratiṁ+iccheyya. 

Now let's work on the second point of Sandhi:
(1) "ṁ" is to be changed into "m" by the procedure as per Sutta 34. It then becomes > Tatrābhiratim+iccheyya. 

(2) By procedure of this Sutta 11, "m" is to be attached to next vowel 
"i". Now finally morphed form is > **Tatrābhiratimiccheyya.**
Thus through all due procedures as shown in these Suttas, it becomes a complete word. **The students do not need to remember all this.** They just only need to learn how morphological procedures as said in the Suttas are carried out in the various stages of evolution of the Pāli words. This will help them learn the structural patterns of the word and gain some insight into the language patterns and achieve mastery of language to some degree, which in many ways can greatly benefit in the study of Buddhist texts written in Pāli. Keep in mind that the role of Sutta 10 and 11 are always necessary **as far as the study of** 
morphological procedures of words are concerned in the Pāli grammar.

Yutte'ti kasmā? Why the word "yutte" is included in Sutta? *Akkocchi maṁ, *avadhi maṁ, *ajini maṁ, *ahāsi me.

Akkocchi-(he) reviled. maṁ-me. **avadhi-**(he) hurt. maṁ-me. **ajini**-
(he) conquered. **maṁ-**me, **ahāsi-**(he) took me-my (things).

Ettha pana yuttaṁ na hoti. Here in this example "Akkocchi maṁ etc.,", there is no 
"yutta", hence no need to re-attach any vowel-less consonant in those phrases. (In such examples, the term "yutte",
as a result, is irrelevant and inapplicable.) 
Note: **Yutta** means being appropriate, **i.e.** the applicability of Sandhi procedure.

When a Sara (vowel) follows, the preceding vowel is to be elided.

Summary: The function of this Sutta **elides the front vowel** when two vowels of different words are in a union after the separation of Sandhi, one in the front, and the other next to it.

[CS] (a) - Yass'indriyāni samathaṅ'gatāni.

[Here see union of two vowels, one the last "a" of the word Yassa, the other front "i" of the word indriyani. The front "a" is to be elided.] 
(b) No hi+etaṁ bhante.

No hi-is not appropriate. **etaṁ-**this fact. **bhante-**Lord Buddha. [Here, union occurs between **"i and e"**.]
(c) Sametu+āyasmā saṅghena.

Sametu-let it be harmonious. **āyasmā-**Your venerable. **saṅghena**-with community of Sangha. [Here, union occurs between "u and ā".]
Now look at separations of Sandhi shown above. There is a union of two vowels, one in the front and one next to it in each separated Sandhi, shown by means of a plus+ sign.

The front vowel is to be elided as per this Sutta. Then the vowel-less consonant in front of the elided vowel is to be attached to next vowel after the plus sign as prescribed by Sutta 11. Then it becomes a complete word perfectly combined in Sandhi.

The whole procedure is quite simple and easy to understand though it may at first seem a bit complex process for a beginner.

The Structural Morphology:
(This will be abbreviated as [SM] throughout this book) 
[SM] Just elide or wipe out the front vowels **(a) a (b) i (c) u** and attach all front three vowel-less consonants **(a) s (b) h (c) t** to next vowels. It is done! This means that once it is done, it will be combined into a Sandhi such as those **shown in [CS**]

## Functions By "Yogavibhāga" (The Split-Sutta Procedure)

Suttavibhāgena bahudhā siyā. By means of splitting multiple partial Suttas such as "To dassa ca" etc., other forms of various morphological changes are made possible. (See examples below shown in bold-letters. This sign > means it becomes. All examples are quite easy to understand. As a matter of fact, these examples are not Sandhi but a kind of **word-form changes only**) 

## (1) To Dassa,

[SM] These examples will be explained in Sutta 41 later.

Navā'ti kasmā? Pañcaha'ṅgehi samannāgato. Muttacāgī anu'ddhato. Why is there the word "navā" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in such instances of phrase examples as "pañcaha'ṅgehi samannāgato, muttacāgī anu'ddhato" and so on as it is being restricted by the word "navā".

[CS] (a) * Pañcaha'ṅgehi samannāgato.

(b) * Muttacāgī anu'ddhato
[SS] (a) * Pañcahi+aṅgehi samannāgato.

(b) * Muttacāgī+anu'ddhato.

Summary: This Sutta changes "e" of "eva" into "ri" and also shortens the vowel in front of "**eva".** (2 Functions) 
[CS] (a) - Yatha'riva vasudhātalañ'ca sabbaṁ.

Yatha'riva-like, just as, **vasudhātalañ'ca**-the surface of the earth. **sabbaṁ-**all. [**vasudhā-**earth**. talaṁ-**surface**+ca-**also]
(b) - Tatha'riva guṇavā supūjaniyo.

Tatha'riva-similarly in that manner. **guṇavā-**the virtuous one. supūjaniyo-is to be honored well. **i.e.** Just as all the surface of earth (is to be appreciated), so is the virtuous one to be honored. 

[SS] (a) - Yathā+eva (b) - Tathā+eva [SM] For both examples, just change "e" into "ri" and shorten the front "ā" into "a". It is done.

Navā'ti kasmā? *Yathā eva. *Tathā eva. Why is there the word "navā" in Sutta?

It is to show that the function of this Sutta's rule is inapplicable in such instances of phrase examples as "yathā eva, tathā eva" etc. (There is no Sandhi in the example. Hence, inapplicable. These words are already separate words).

[V] Sarā kho byañjane pare pakatirūpāni honti.

When a consonant follows, the front vowel is to be kept as a "pakati"(without applying any morphological function).

Note: Withholding any specific function such as elision, changing into other word forms as prescribed in certain Suttas such as 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, is called a "**pakati sandhi**" process. Why a "Pakati" procedure? Because it is totally unnecessary to have any Sandhi process lest it may corrupt the structural pattern of words or phrases. Thus keeps the proper meaning of the words.

See examples carefully. Even though a next consonant is present in each examples shown by the side of a plus sign, there is no specific function of Sandhi applied on the front vowels. 

[CS] (a) - Mano'pubbaṅgamā dhammā.

(b) - Pamādo'maccuno padaṁ. (c) Tiṇṇo'pāraṅgato ahu.

[SS] (a) - Mano+pubbaṅgamā dhammā.

Tiṇṇo-the one who had crossed. **pāraṅgato-**the one who had gone to the other shore of safety and peace. **ahu-**was. i.e. (The enlightened saint) had crossed the ocean of suffering and had gone to the shore of Nibbāna. 

[SM] For all examples (a-b-c), keep the vowel "o" as a "**pakati, o**" without performing any morphological procedure.

Ko-who. **imaṁ-**this. **pathaviṁ-**earthly body. **vicessati-**will analyze (with insight knowledge) ? **i.e.** Who is going to analyze this earthly body with insight knowledge?

[SM] Keep the front vowel "o" as a "**pakati, o".** No specific Sandhi procedure is applied on the front vowel "o" despite the presence of next vowel "i". 

## Kvacī'Ti Kasmā?

Why there is the word "Kvaci" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in the examples shown below as restricted by the word "kvaci". * Appassutā'yaṁ puriso.

[CS] * Appassutā'yaṁ puriso [SS] * Appassuto+ayaṁ puriso Appassuto-is of less knowledge. **ayaṁ puriso**-this person. i.e. This person is of less knowledge.

[SM] Just elide the front vowel "o" and lengthen next vowel "a" into "ā" by Sutta 15. Then attach the front consonant "t" to "ā".

Note: The relevant Sutta for each relevant function is an easy guess work for a keen student. So sometimes it will be intentionally left unexplained.

## Ṭhāne'Ti Kasmā?

Why is there the word "ṭhāne" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in some instances as shown below as they are not the right point for reduplication procedure.

* Idha modati, * Pecca modati. (Refer to Sutta 25) Note: No Sandhi process in these examples.

## 29, 42. Vÿg E Gosagosan M Titypxma 29, 42. Vagge Ghosā'Ghosānaṁ Tatiya, Paṭhamā.

[Vagge+ghosa, aghosānaṁ+tatiya, paṭhamā. 3 words]
[V] Vagge kho pubbesaṁ byañjanānaṁ ghosā'ghosabhūtānaṁ saramhā yathāsaṅkhyaṁ tatiya, paṭhama'kkharā dvebhāvaṁ gacchanti ṭhāne. To vagga group consonants which may be either **ghosa (i.e.**
the second) or aghosa **(i.e.** the fourth) following a vowel, a reduplication process is to be carried out by adding the dissimilar consonants of either the **first** (to the second) or the **third** (to the fourth) from the same vagga group respectively wherever applicable.

Note: Even though it is categorically said as **"ghosā'ghosabhūtānaṁ"** in Vutti, not all ghosa or **aghosa** are eligible to be the candidate (**i.e.** the base word) for reduplication. The eligible ghosa is only **the second** and the aghosa eligible to be reduplicated is **the fourth** one. **This Sutta enjoins** to reduplicate the second ghosa with the first of the same vagga group while the fourth is to be reduplicated with the third. Note that non-vagga ghosa and aghosa are inapplicable. Please refer to Sutta 7 & 9 regarding Vagga and ghosa or aghosa. Normally, the procedure of this Sutta is quite challenging to understand without a more simplified explanation and elucidation. The wording 

structure of the Sutta itself seems a bit misplaced. If Sutta is structured as "Vagge ghosā'ghosānaṁ paṭhama, tatiyā", it could be more simple to understand its meaning for the students.

## Method:

(1) If the candidate base word is **the second** in Vagga group, then, the **first** 
dissimilar letter from the same group is to be added to it.

(2) If **the fourth** is the candidate base word, then **the third** from the group is to be added to it. See all the examples and accompanying tables.

Note: The Sandhi applicable by the rule of this Sutta usually used to occur mostly in the individual words prefixed with upasagga particles though it also occurs occasionally in the union of two different words like those cited in the Sutta below.

The examples of Sutta (these examples are at the union of two words) :
[CS] (a) Ese'va - ca**j'jh**ānapphalo.

(b) - Yatra**ṭ'ṭh**itaṁ nappasaheyya maccu. (c) Sele yathā - pabbatamuddhani **ṭ'ṭh**ito. (d) - Cattāri **ṭ'ṭh**ānāni naro pamatto.

[SS] (a) Eseva - ca+jhānapphalo.

Ese'va ca-only this. **jhānapphalo-**is the result of Jhānas. **i.e.** Only this is the result of Jhānas (deep mental absorption states).

(b) - Yatra+ṭhitaṁ nappasaheyya maccu.

Yatra-where. **ṭhitaṁ-**to the one standing. **na'ppasaheyya-**would not overwhelm. **maccu-**death. **i.e.** A place where death cannot overwhelm.

(c) Sele yathā - pabbatamuddhani+ṭhito.

Sele-rocky. **yathā-**like. **pabbatamuddhani-**on top of mountain. 

ṭhito-standing. **i.e.** Like the one standing on top of the rocky mountain (can see things below clearly) 
(d) - Cattāri+ṭhānāni naro pamatto.

Cattāri-the four. **ṭhānāni-**points. **naro-**man. **pamatto-**being ignorant of. **i.e.** The man who is ignorant of the four points.

[SM] For (a) add dissimilar "j" to "jh". [Here "jha" **is the fourth** in Vagga. Therefore, "j"**, the third** becomes its reduplicate]
For (b) add "ṭ" to "ṭh" for (b) (c) and (d). [Here, "ṭha" **is the second**
in Vagga. So "ṭ"**, the first** is its reduplicate]
[See both the front and rear letters carefully as shown in bold-faced letters. Check what kind of dissimilar letter is to be reduplicated in each example.]

## Ṭhāne'Ti Kasmā?

Why is there the word "ṭhāne" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in the example shown below as it is not the due place for this rule. * Idha cetaso daḷhaṁ gaṇhāti thāmasā.

Idha-in this noble teaching of Budda. **cetaso-**of the mind. daḷhaṁ-

firmly. **gaṇhāti-**holds or focuses. **thāmasā-**by power of. **i.e.** In this noble teaching of Buddha, (The disciple who is committed) firmly holds his (object of meditation) by power of the concentrated mind.

[CS] * Idha cetaso [SM] The function of this Sutta is inapplicable as it is not the due point.

[SM] For (a), by this Sutta, change "ṁ" into "aṁ". Now, it will look like this: [• Eva+**aṁ+v**utte.] Elide the "a" of "eva". Now, it will look like this: [• Ev+**aṁ+v**utte.]. It is done. For (b) the first point of Sandhi, by this Sutta, change "ṁ" into "aṁ". Now, it will look like this: [• Ta+aṁ+**sādhu+i**ti paṭissuṇitvā] Elide the front "a" of "Ta". Now, it will look like this:
[• T+aṁ+**sādhu+i**ti paṭissuṇitvā].

For the second point of Sandhi, elide the next vowel "i" by Sutta 13 and lengthen the front "u" into "ū" by Sutta 16.

Now, it will be combined in Sandhi like this: [• Taṁ sādhūti paṭissuṇitvā]. It is done.

## 31. 49. Vÿg®T M Va Vÿg E 31, 49. Vagga'Ntaṁ Vā Vagge

[Vagga-antaṁ+vā+vagge. 3 words]
[V] Vaggabhūte byañjane pare niggahitaṁ kho **vaggantaṁ** vā pappoti.

When a consonant belonging to a specific vagga group follows (**i.e.** is present behind), the "niggahita-ṁ" in front is to be sometimes changed into the last consonant of that vagga group accordingly.

Summary: This Sutta enjoins to change so-called Niggahita "ṁ" into "**ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, m**" depending on the next letter of relevant Vagga-groups it precedes. The five consonants "**ṅ, ñ, ṇ,** 
n, m" are called "**Vagganta**-the end-consonants of the Vagga-group, or nasal stops". [Refer to Sutta 7 to clearly understand this function.]
Here is how the rule of this Sutta is to be applied:
(a) If "ṁ" precedes one of **k, kh, g, gh** then it will be changed into "ṅ". (b) If "ṁ" precedes one of **c, ch, j, jh** then it will be changed into
"ñ".

(c) If "ṁ" precedes one of **ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh** then it will be changed into
"ṇ".

(d) If "ṁ" precedes one of **t, th, d, dh,*n** then it will be changed into "n".

(e) If "ṁ" precedes one of **p, ph, b, bh, m** then it will be changed into "m".

Note: The **anomalous examples** where *n constitute as the end-syllable of Vagga are also found in some Pāli texts such as "tan'niccutaṁ, **Kinnu**" etc.

In this grammar text, in Sutta No. 573, Sā'disanta puccha, bhanja, hansā'dīhi ṭṭho, "**hansādīhi**" is an anomalous Sandhi-form where a non-vagga "s" is preceded by "ṁ". Without such Sandhi being applied, it should be "**haṁsādīhi**-from the root **haṁsa** etc,".

[CS] (a) - Tan'niccutaṁ. Here "ṁ" precedes "n".

(b) - Dhammañ'care sucaritaṁ. Here "ṁ" precedes "c", so it becomes "ñ".

(c) - Cirap'pavāsiṁ purisaṁ. Here "ṁ" precedes "p", so it becomes "m".

(d) - Santan'tassa manaṁ hoti. Here "ṁ" precedes "t", so it becomes "n".

(e) - Taṅ'kāruṇikaṁ. Here "ṁ" precedes "k", so it becomes "ṅ". (f) - Evaṅ'kho bhikkhave sikkhitabbaṁ. Here "ṁ" precedes
"kh", hence it becomes "ṅ".

Note: Though the Sutta enjoins to change "ṁ" into the end-syllables 
"ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, m", **there are some anomalous examples** such as the example (c). See the points of Sandhi in these examples shown in bold-faced two letters. Check which Vagga group the next letter belongs to. The solution as to which letter is to become the morpheme of the front niggahita will be quite easy to understand.

[SS] (a) - Taṁ+niccutaṁ.

Taṁ-That Nibbāna. **niccutaṁ-**is without change [Ni-without+**cuta-**death or change]
(b) - Dhammaṁ+care sucaritaṁ.

Dhammaṁ-the Dhamma. **care-**(one) should practice. **sucaritaṁ-**by being well-practiced. **i.e.** One should practice Dhamma well,
(not half-heartedly nor sporadically but with consistent effort).

(c) - Ciraṁ+pavāsiṁ purisaṁ.

Ciraṁ-for long. **pavāsiṁ-**used to be living abroad. **purisaṁ-**to the person. **i.e.** To the person who used to live in other lands for long (when he safely returns, both family and friends warmly welcome him).

(d) - Santaṁ+tassa manaṁ hoti.

Santaṁ-calm. **tassa-**of that person. **manaṁ-**mind. **hoti-**is. **i.e.**
The mind of that person (who progressed in meditation) is calm.

(e) - Taṁ+kāruṇikaṁ.

Taṁ-to that. **kāruṇikaṁ-**compassionate Buddha.

(f) - Evaṁ+kho bhikkhave.

Evaṁ kho-thus. **bhikkhave-**monks!

[SM] For example (a), change "ṁ" into "n". For (b) change into "ñ", For 
(c) change into "m", this "m" is to be changed into "p" by means of "Ca" in Sutta 35. If directly changes into "p" by this Sutta alone, it will contravene the injunction of this Sutta. For (d) change into "n",

For (e-f), change into "ṅ".

Vāggahaṇena niggahitaṁ kho la-kārādeso hoti. By the word "vā" included in this Sutta, the niggahita changes into consonant "l".

[CS] - Puggalaṁ-to an individual. [SS] Puggaṁ+aṁ
[SM] Change the front "aṁ" into "l" and attach it to next "a". It is done.

Vā'ti kasmā? Why is there the word "vā" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in the examples shown below as restricted by "vā".

[CS] * Na taṁ kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu.

Na-not. **taṁ-**that. **kammaṁ-**deed. **kataṁ-**which is done. **sādhu-**good. **i.e.** that (unwholesome) deed which has been done is not good.

[SS] * Na taṁ+kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu. [SM] No Sandhi function.

TABLE OF VAGGANTA-FUNCTION
This table explains how "ṁ" is to be systematically morphed into the respective end-consonants of vagga. 

32, 50. ah e Y M 
32, 50. **E,he ñaṁ** [E-he+ñaṁ. 2 words]
[V] E-kāra, ha-kāre pare niggahitaṁ kho ña-kāraṁ pappoti vā.

When either vowel "e" or consonant "h" are present behind, the "niggahita-ṁ" in front sometimes changes into "ñ". [See "e" is behind in the examples **a, b**. "h" is behind in c, d]
[CS] (a) - Paccattañ'ñeva parinibbāyissāmi.

Paccattañ'ñeva-by oneself. **parinibbāyissāmi-**(I) will enter into Nibbānic peace by oneself.

(b) - Tañ'ñeve'ttha paṭipucchissāmi.

Tañ'ñeva-only to you. **ettha**-here. **paṭipucchissāmi-**(I) will requestion. i.e. I will question you again in this matter.

(c) - Evañ'hi vo bhikkhave sikkhitabbaṁ.

Evañ'hi-only thus. vo-by you. **bhikkhave-**monks! **sikkhitabbaṁ**-should train. **i.e.** You should thus train (practice).

(d) - Tañ'hi tassa musā hoti.

Tañ'hi-that word. **tassa-**of that person. **musā**-wrong. **hoti**-is. 

i.e. His word is wrong.

[SS] (a) - Paccattaṁ+eva.

(b) - Taṁ+evettha. (e of a *nipāta* word "eva" is present in these examples) 
(c) - Evaṁ+hi.

(d) - Taṁ+hi. (h of a *nipāta* word "hi" is present in these examples) 
[SM] For (a) (b), change "ṁ" of all examples into one single "ñ" and redouble it by Sutta 28. Then attach the double "ññ" to next respective vowels.

For (c) (d), just change "ṁ" into "ñ" and attach it to next consonant 
"h". It is done.

Vā'ti kasmā? Why is there the word "vā" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in some instances shown below as restricted by the word "vā".

[CS] * Eva'metaṁ abhiññāya, *Evaṁ hoti subhāsitaṁ.

Evaṁ-thus. **etaṁ-**that Dhamma. **abhiññāya-**having known. Evaṁthus. **hoti-**is. **subhāsitaṁ-**well-said. **i.e.** Having known that Dhamma thus, (the word thus said) is well-said.

[SS] *(a) Evaṁ+etaṁ (b) *Evaṁ hoti [SM] (a) Change "ṁ" into "m" by 34 and attach it to the next vowel. It is done. (b) Same as in example "evaṁ vutte" at Sutta 30.

## 33. 50. S Y E C

33, 50. **Sa ye ca** [Sa+ye+ca. 3 words]
[V] Niggahitaṁ kho ya-kāre pare saha ya-kārena ñakāraṁ pappoti vā. When consonant "ya" follows, the "niggahita-ṁ" in front, along with "ya", sometimes changes into "ñ".

[CS] (a) - Sañ'ñogo-joined together. (b) - Sañ'ñuttaṁ-conjoined. [SS] (a) - Saṁ+yogo (b) - Saṁ+yuttaṁ. [SM] Change "ṁ" together with "y" as prescribed by Sutta into one single 
"ñ". Reduplicate it by 28 and attach to respective vowels "o and u" of each example. It is done.

Vā'ti kasmā? Why is there the word "vā" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in some instances shown below as restricted by "vā". * Saṁyogo. * Saṁyuttaṁ.

[SM] No Sandhi in these examples. That is why there is an "ṁ" still remaining intact without changing into any specific word-form.

## 34, 52. Mda Sre

34, 52. **Ma,dā sare** [Ma, dā+sare. 2 words]
[V] Niggahitassa kho sare pare ma-kāra, da-kārā'desā honti vā. When a vowel is present behind, the "niggahita-ṁ" in front is to be sometimes changed into consonants "m or d".

[SM] (a) Change "ṁ" into "m" (b) into "d". Then attach those "m" and "d" to next vowels. Then they become perfectly combined words in the Sandhi.

Vā'ti kasmā? Why is there the word "vā" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in examples shown below as it is restricted by the word "vā". *Akkocchi maṁ, *avadhi maṁ, *ajini maṁ, *ahāsi me. (Re: 
Sutta 11) 
[SM] No Sandhi process occurred in these examples.

## 36, 47. Evic So ˆY²Jne

36, 47. **Kvaci o byañjane** [Kvaci+o+byañjane. 3 words]
[V] Byañjane pare kvaci o-kārā'gamo hoti.

When a consonant follows behind, the vowel "o" is sometimes inserted (in front of it).

[CS] (a) - Atippago' kho tāva sāvatthiyaṁ piṇḍāya carituṁ.

Atippago' kho-it is too early. **tāva-**first. **sāvatthiyaṁ-**in the city of Sāvatthi. **piṇḍāya-**for alms. **carituṁ-**to go around. i.e. It is still early to go for alms in the city of Sāvatthi.

(b) - Paro'sahassaṁ-more than thousands.

Attach "g" to "o". It is done.

For (b), Insert "o" by this Sutta in front of "s". At this stage, it will look like this: [• Para+o+sahassaṁ]. Elide "a" as there is "o" present behind at the union of two vowels [Par+o+sahassaṁ.]. Attach "r" to next "o" . It is done.

## 163 Kvacī'Ki Kasmā?

Why is there the word "kvaci" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this rule is inapplicable in some instances shown below as restricted by "kvaci".

andhī bhūto-is being blind. **ayaṁ-**this. **loko-**world. **i.e.** This world is being blind (as majority of beings lack wisdom).

[SM] For (a), no Sandhi function at the first point, inserting "o" in front of
"p" is inapplicable. At the second point, the front vowel "a" of "tha" is elided and "th" is attached to the next "i".

For example (b), no specific Sandhi function is applied.

[V] Niggahitañ'cā'gamo hoti sare vā byañjane vā pare kvaci.

When either a consonant or a vowel is present behind, "the niggahita-ṁ" is sometimes inserted (in front of that vowel or consonant).

[CS] (a) - Cakkhuṁ'udapādi.

(b) - Avaṁ'siro. (c) - Yāva'ñc'idha bhikkhave (d) - Purimaṁ'jātiṁ sarāmi. (e) - Aṇu**ṁ'th**ūlāni sabbaso. (f) - Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā.

[SS] (a) - Cakkhu+udapādi.

Cakkhu-the wisdom eye. **udapādi-**arose, appeared.

(b) - Ava+siro-with the head being downward. (c) - Yāva+ca+idha bhikkhave (2 points).

Yāva ca-very much. **idha-**here. **bhikkhave-**monks!

(d) - Purima+jātiṁ sarāmi.

Purimajātiṁ-the previous life. **sarāmi**-(I) remember.

(e) - Aṇu+thūlāni sabbaso.

(f) - Mano pubba+gamā dhammā. (Re Sutta 23) 
[SM] For (a) (b) (d) (e), just insert "ṁ" in front of each "**u, s, j, th**". It is done quite easily.

For the first point of (c), insert "ṁ" in front of "c". Change that "ṁ" into "ñ" by Sutta 31 and attach it to next consonant "c". It will look like this [**• Yāva+ñca+idha**]. Now, at the second point, elide the front vowel "a" of "ñca" and attach the conjunct consonants "ñc" to next "i". Then, it will look like ["**• Yāvañcidha".**] It is done now and becomes a perfectly combined Sandhi.

As for (f), insert "ṁ" in front of "**g".** Then, change it into "ṅ" by Sutta 31. Attach it to next "ga". It is done.

## Kvacī'Ti Kasmā?

Why is there the word "kvaci" in Sutta? It is to show that the function of this Sutta is inapplicable in some instances shown below as restricted by "kvaci". * Idhe'va naṁ pasaṁsanti. * Pecca sagge pamodati.

Idha eva-even here in this world. **naṁ-**to that person. **pasaṁsanti**-(the wise) praise. **Pecca**-in the next life. **sagge**-in the heaven. **pamodati**-(he) rejoices. **i.e.** Even in this world, the wise praise him. In next life too, he rejoices in the heaven.

*Na hi etehi yānehi, gaccheyya agataṁ disaṁ.

Na-not. hi-in fact. **etehi-**by these. **yānehi-**vehicles, **gaccheyya-**(one) 
may go. **agataṁ-**never gone before. **disaṁ-**to the direction of Nibbāna.

i.e. In fact, one would not reach the never-gone-before direction of Nibbāna by means of these physical vehicles.

In the stanza above, there are only two examples:
[CS] (a) * Idhe'va (b) * Pecca sagge (c) * Na hi etehi [SS] (a) * Idha+eva (b) * Pecca+sagge (c) * Na hi etehi [SM] For (a) just elide the front vowel "a" and attach "dh" to next "e". It is done. This example is where a possible Sandhi is inapplicable between two vowels a and e.

For (b,c), there is no Sandhi at all.

Caggahaṇena vi-saddassa ca pa-kāro hoti. By means of "ca" in the Sutta, "vi" sometimes becomes "**pa".**
[CS] - P'acessati. * Vicessati vā. (*means inapplicable example) [SS] - Pa'cessati-will choose.>Vi'cessati-will choose. [SM] A very simple procedure. Just change "vi" into "pa". It is done.

Note that both "vi" and "pa" are two *upasagga* words which are interchangeable in terms of meaning. The *upasagga* "vi" means specially or specifically and "pa" means "in various ways, or analytically". Both are widely used as prefixes of the Pāli verbs which can impact the meaning of roots in various ways.

[SM] Although "ṁ" should be elided in both examples, it is not elided. No Sandhi process except in (a) where it is shown by a plus sign. Just change "ṁ" into "m" by 34 and attach it to the next vowel "u" . It is done. There is no Sandhi in (b).

## 40, 55. Pro Va Sro

40, 55. **Paro vā saro** [Paro+vā+saro. 3 words]
[V] Niggahitamhā paro saro lopaṁ pappoti vā.

The vowel after "the niggahita-ṁ" is sometimes elided.

[CS] (a) Bhāsitaṁ - abhinandun'ti.

[V] Niggahitamhā parasmiṁ sare lutte yadi byañjano sasaññogo, visaññogo hoti. After the vowel behind "the niggahita-ṁ" had been elided, if that consonant right next to the elided vowel is a double conjunct-consonant, then it has to be made into a single consonant. Summary: This Sutta changes conjunct-consonants located behind the deleted vowel after "niggahita-ṁ" into a single consonant. [See the examples and SM to clarify this function]
[CS] (a) - Evaṁ'sa te āsavā. (b) - Pupphaṁ'sā uppajji.

See conjunct consonants shown below in bold, underlined.

[SS] (a) - Evaṁ+assa te āsavā.

[SM] For both (a-b), elide "a" behind "ṁ" by Sutta 40. Now, change conjunct "ss" into single "s" by eliding one "s" through this Sutta. It is done.

## Lutte'Ti Kasmā?

Why is there the word "lutte" included in Sutta?

It is to show that in the examples below, there is no "Luttaelision procedure" occurred. So, inapplicable for the rule of this Sutta to be applied on them.

* Eva'massa. * Vidūna'gga'miti. (2 points) 

[CS] * Eva'massa. * Vidūna'gga'miti (Re: Sutta 38) [SS] (a) * Evaṁ+assa.

Evaṁ-thus. **assa**-should have been.

(b) * Vidūnaṁ+aggaṁ+iti.

[SM] For (a), Just change "ṁ" into "m" by Sutta 34 and attach it to next vowel "a". (For example (b) refer to Sutta 38.) 
Caggahaṇena tiṇṇaṁ byañjanāna'mantare ye sarūpā, tesam'pi lopo hoti.

By means of "ca" included in Sutta, one of similar consonants conjoined in a cluster of three consonants, has to be elided. (See the examples and detailed explanation) 
Note: Only "**gg,** and **tt",** two similar consonants can be seen in the separation. It will become three when "i" changes into "y" in the morphological procedure as per Sutta 21. Then, one "g" and one "t" has to be elided as per the function of the word "ca" in this Sutta. **See SM to understand on how all the necessary procedures are done** to complete the word.

[CS] (a) - Agyā'gāraṁ-fire-hut (where sacrifices are performed or cooking etc., is done).

(b) - Paṭisanthāravuty'assa. (Re: Sutta 21) 
[SS] (a) - Aggi+āgāraṁ.

(b) - Paṭisanthāravutti+assa.

[SM] For (a), change "i" into "y" by Sutta 21. Now, it will look like: 
"(a) - Aggy+āgāraṁ". By means of applying the function of "ca" in this Sutta, elide one "g" of "gg" where three conjunct consonants 
"ggy" are clustered. It then looks like: "(a) - Agy+āgāraṁ". Now, attach "gy" to the next vowel "ā". It is done.

For (b), change "i" into "y" by Sutta 21. Now, it looks like: "(b) - Paṭisanthāravutty+assa". By means of applying the function of 
"ca" in this Sutta, elide one "t" of "tt" where three conjunct consonants "tty" are clustered. Now, it looks like:
"(b) - Paṭisanthāravuty+assa". It will become a perfectly combined word in a Sandhi when conjunct consonants "ty" are attached to the next vowel "a".

be carried out (15either by any applicable means shown in the preceding Suttas or by this great Sutta *Mahāvutti*).

Examples: The word in squiggly brackets shows an *upasagga* or a *nipāta* as an initial part of the example word. See footnote below.

(1) {pa} •Pā'panaṁ> Pa+āpanaṁ-specifically arriving.

[SM] Elide the front "a" and attach "p" to the next "ā".

(2) {parā} - Parā'yaṇaṁ> Para+āyaṇaṁ-shelter, refuge. (3) {upa} - Upā'yanaṁ> Upa+āyanaṁ-carrying closely.

- Upā'hanaṁ> Upa+āhanaṁ-slippers, such as shoes etc,.

(MS is the same as foregoing example) 
(4) {ni} •Nyā'yogo> Ni+ā'yogo-consistent effort.

[SM] Change "i" into "y" and attach it to next "ā".

- Ni'rupadhi> Ni+upadhi-without Upadhi (base).

[SM] Insert "r" in front of "u" and attach it to next "u".

Note: Attaching the inserted consonant to the next vowel is quite a necessary process for Pāli words written in Asian Languages. But, for Romanized Pāli, it is almost unnecessary as both vowel and consonants are written in tandem without being **conjoined together. Even if it is unnecessary, it is shown in SM as a way of** 
adhering to the formal **standard morphological procedures.**
(5) {anu} - Anu'bodho> Anu+bodho-knowledge based on method or inference.

[SM] Keep as a "**Pakati**" without any alteration through Sandhi procedure. This is the only example of "**pakati Sandhi**".

(6) {du} - Du'vūpasantaṁ> Du+upasantaṁ-bad calm.

[SM] Insert "v" in front of "u" and lengthen "u" by 25 & attach it to "ū".

(7) {su} - Suv'ūpasantaṁ> Su+upasantaṁ-good calm.

[SM] Insert "v" in front of "u" and lengthen "u" by 25 & attach it to "ū".

(8) {du} - Dvā'layo> Du+ā'layo-bad base or bad desire.

[SM] Change "u" into "v" and attach "dv" to "ā".

(9) {su} - Svā'layo> Su+ā'layo-good base, good desire.

[SM] Change "u" into "v" and attach "dv" to "ā".

(10) {du} - Du'rākhyātaṁ> Du'+ākhyātaṁ-badly said.

[SM] Insert "r" in front of "ā" and attach it to "ā".

(11) {su} - Svā'khyāto > Su+ākhyāto-well said.

[SM] Change "u" into "v" and attach "sv" to "ā".

Note: In majority of Buddhist texts, the word "Svakkhāto" is mostly found without consonant "y" after "kh". It is to be separated as Su+akkhāto. Just change "u" into "v".

(12) {u} - U'dīritaṁ> U+īritaṁ-much said.

[SM] Insert "d" in front of "ī" and attach it to "ī".

(13) {saṁ} - Sa'muddiṭṭhaṁ> Saṁ+uddiṭṭhaṁ-well expounded.

[SM] Change "ṁ" into "m" by 34 and attach it to next vowel "u".

(14) {vi} - Vi'yaggaṁ> Vi+aggaṁ-specially noble.

[SM] Insert "y" in front of "a" and it is done.

(15) {vi} - Vi'jjhaggaṁ> Vi+**adhi+a**ggaṁ-especially more noble.

[SM] Change "**adhi**" into "**ajjha**" by 45 [Vi+ajjha+aggaṁ]. Elide the initial "a" of "**ajjha**" by Sutta 13 [Vi+jjha+aggaṁ]. Also, elide the last "a" of "**jjha**" by Sutta 12 and attach triple consonant "jjh" to next "a". It is done [Vi+jjh+aggaṁ].

(16) {vi} - Bya'ggaṁ> Vi+aggaṁ-specially noble.

[SM] Change "i" into "y" by 21 and attach "vy" to next "a". It is done.

(17) {ava} - Ava'yāgamanaṁ> Ava+āgamanaṁ-badly coming.

[SM] Insert "y" in front of "ā" by 35. It is done.

(18) {anu} - Anve'ti> Anu+eti-subsequently follows.

[SM] Change "u" into "v" by 18 and attach "nv" to next vowel "e".

- Anu'paghāto> Ana+upaghāto-unharmed.

[SM] Elide front "a" by 12 and attach "n" to next "u".

(19) {ana or anu} - Ana'cchariyaṁ> Ana+acchariyaṁ-not surprising. **Also:** Anu+acchariyaṁ-repeatedly surprising.

(**Please Note:** Two possible SS for this word as "ana" 

can be a morpheme of *Nipāta* particle "na-not" or upasagga "**anu-**repeatedly".

[SM] In both SS, elide the front vowels and attach "n" to next vowels. It is quite a simple process.

(20) {pari} - Pari'yesanā> Pari+esanā-search.

[SM] Insert "y" in front of "e" by 35.

(21) {parā} - Parā'māso> Para+āmāso-repeatedly rubbing and touching something or wrongly holding a view or an idea.

[SM] Elide the front "a" and attach "r" to next "ā".

(1) {pari} - Pari'ggaho> Pari+gaho-taking possession. (2) {pa} - Pa'ggaho> Pa+gaho-supporting by means of encouragement.

etc.

- Pakkamo> Pa+kamo-leaving away, departure. - Parakkamo> Para+kamo-continuous effort.

(3) {ni} - Ni'kkamo> Ni+kamo-departure.

- Ni'kkasāvo> Ni+kasāvo-without taint of defilements. - Ni'llayanaṁ> Ni+layanaṁ-hiding.

(4) {du} - Du'llayanaṁ> Du+layanaṁ-badly based.

[SM] For all these examples above, reduplicate a similar consonant in front of each relevant consonant and attach to it.

- Du'bbhikkhaṁ> Du+bhikkhaṁ-famine, scarcity of food.

[SM] Reduplicate a dissimilar consonant "b" in front of "bh" and attach to it.

(5) {du} - Du'bbuttaṁ>Du+buttaṁ-badly said.

[SM] Reduplicate a similar consonant "b" and attach to it.

(6) {saṁ} - San'diṭṭhaṁ > Saṁ+diṭṭhaṁ-well seen or to be seen by oneself.

[SM] Change "ṁ" into "n" by Sutta 31 and attach that "n" to "di".

(7) {du} - Du'ggaho> Du+gaho-bad taking.

(8) {vi}• Vi'ggaho> Vi+gaho-specially taking or dispute.

(9) {ni}• Ni'ggato> Ni+gato-leaving. (10) {abhi} - Abhi'kkamo> Abhi+kamo-advancing. (11) {paṭi} - Paṭi'kkamo> Paṭi+kamo-going backward.

[SM] For all these examples, just reduplicate similar consonants and attach it to the next consonant to form conjuncts.

evaṁ byañjane ca.

Thus, (these shown above are examples of) consonantSandhi.

Sesā sabbe yojetabbā. All the rest (of other similar examples from various source of texts) should be similarly applied.

Note: Necessary morphological procedures for completing all the examples shown in the Sutta can be performed by means of this Sutta although most of examples are similar to those already shown in the previous Suttas. In addition, other various examples of Sandhi found in the wider areas of Pāli texts can also be completed.

52, 60. **Jinavacanayuttaṁ hi.** [Jinavacanayuttaṁ+hi. 2 words]
[V] "Jinavacanayuttaṁ hi" icce'taṁ adhikāratthaṁ veditabbaṁ.

This "**Jinavacanayuttaṁ** hi" Sutta is to be known as an Adhikāra (Prevailing or governing rule) Sutta. Summary: Jinavacanayuttaṁ hi means that "only what conforms to the words of Buddha," **i.e.** usage in the Buddhist texts, (shall be applied throughout this grammar.) 
Note: This influences all the preceding and succeeding Suttas regarding the observation of important grammatical principle of conformity to the relevant and applicable usages in the Pāli Buddhist texts.

[Adhikāra=Adhi-By prevailing over, influencing+**kara**-to do+ṇa-act of. This applied affix ṇa is in the base structure of the word] 
There are three kinds of adhikāra:
(1) sīha-gatika.This type affects all the preceding and succeeding Suttas. [**sīha**-the lion's+**gatika**-mode of motion all over]
(2) maṇḍūka-gatika. This only affects a certain few Suttas of relevant and related nature from here and there. [**maṇḍūka**-the frog's+**gatika**- mode of leaping] 
(3) yathānupubbika. This kind of Sutta affects in orderly manner of sequences, especially succeeding Suttas [**yathā**-according to+**anu** pubbika-the order of sequence]. This Sutta is the first type which is also very important grammatical principle for the whole text.

[V] Yathā yathā jinavacanayuttaṁ hi liṅgaṁ, tathā tathā idha liṅgañ'ca nippajjate.

The genders of nouns will be laid out and explained here in this grammar only in ways that conform to the usage patterns of Buddha' words. **i.e.**, prevalent linguistic pattern and usage applicable in the Buddhist texts.

Taṁ yathā? 

What is that? (**i.e.** for example) - Eso no satthā. - Brahmā . - Attā. - Sakhā. - Rājā.

[Translation of Examples] Eso-that person, no-our, satthā-(is) teacher. **i.e.** That person is our teacher.

Brahmā-Holy Brahmā, God. Attā-soul, oneself (a reflexive pronoun, two meanings). Sakhā-friend. Rājā-King.

## Liṅga (Genders)

There are **three genders**: masculine, feminine and neuter genders. (1) The outstanding feature of masculine gender nouns is
"o". e.g. manusso (the man), Buddho (Buddha) etc.

(2) The outstanding feature of the feminine gender nouns are "**ā, ī** and **inī".** e.g., mālā (the flower), nadī (the river), rājinī (the princess).

(3) Major feature for the neuter gender nouns is "aṁ". e.g., 
Vanaṁ (the forest), phalaṁ (the fruit) etc.

Note: All features are for nouns in nominative singular. This is a traditionally taught basic for the beginners. Please note this fact clearly.

## Gender And Nouns

These liṅga (genders) are to be assigned to each individual nouns such as masculine gender noun, feminine gender noun and neuter gender nouns. There are various kinds of nouns which students of grammar should understand as a basic knowledge. They are: (1) **Nāma** nāma-**individual nouns** with specific gender.

(2) **Sabba** nāma-**common nouns** such as ya-which, **ta, eta**that, ima-this, kiṁ-what, amu-so and so, which have variable three genders.

 (The **pronouns** such as **tumha**-you, and **amha**-me, are included in this group though they have no specific gender) 
(3) **Samāsa** nāma-**compound nouns** with specific gender.

(4) **Taddhita** nāma-**nouns in Taddhita-affixes** with specific gender. **Numerical nouns** are also included in this group though some are of variable gender.

(5) **Kita** nāma-**nouns in Kita-affixes** with specific gender
(**Uṇādi**-affixed words included in this category).

Note: The term "Nāma" means noun.

## 54, 62. Tto C Ivbvøayo

54, 62. **Tato ca vibhattiyo.** [Tato+ca+vibhattiyo. 3 words]
[V] Tato jinavacanayuttehi liṅgehi vibhattiyo parā honti.

The Vibhatti, (**i.e.** prepositions or **case-endings of nouns**) are to be **applied after those nouns** of specific genders in line with the prevalent usage in the Buddhist texts. Summary: This Sutta clearly sets out the rule that the vibhattis are to be applied after nouns of clearly defined three genders in order to be changed into various wordforms and inflections in accordance with the prescribed morphological rules of Suttas in this grammar text. Verb-terminations also similarly known as **vibhatti** are to be applied after the roots in the case of Pāli Ākhyāta verbs. See Vibhatti **for nouns** in the next Sutta. The other Vibhatti **for verbs** will be shown in the first section of Ākhyāta. Note: Even though it cannot be defined in terms of noun or gender, some certain *upasagga* and *nipāta* particles, which are used as an independent word in a sentence are applicable to this rule as an exception. 

Vibhatti means that which defines and distinguishes between what is one and what is more than one, **i.e.** singular and plural. (vi-specifically, bhatti-setting aside, to divide). **Vibhatti** means preposition, but the 

translated English term is a misnomer as the vibhattis are to be applied after nouns, a rather different linguistic norm most prevalent in the ancient Indian languages and one aspect different from the English grammar. "14 Vibhattis" will be shown in the next Sutta. **[Vibhatti**=Vispecially+**baja**-to assign+ti-act of. A feminine gender Kita-noun word]

Si, yo iti **paṭhamā.** aṁ, yo iti **dutiyā.** nā, hi iti **tatiyā.** sa, naṁ iti catutthī. smā, hi iti **pañcamī.** sa, naṁ iti chaṭṭhī. smiṁ, su iti **sattamī.** They are namely: (1) **Si, yo,** these two are called **paṭhamā vibhatti** (Nominative case, si is nominative singular, yo is nominative plural).

(2) **Si, yo,** these two are called **ālapana paṭhamā vibhatti** (Vocative case). (**This is not in the original text**, added for the completeness's sake for vocative case.) 
(3) **aṁ, yo,** these two are called **dutiyā vibhatti** (Accusative case, aṁ is singular, yo is plural).

(4) **nā, hi,** these two are called **tatiyā vibhatti** (Instrumental case, nā is singular, hi is plural).

(5) **sa, naṁ,** these two are called **catutthī vibhatti** (Dative case, sa is singular, naṁ is plural).

(6) **smā, hi,** these two are called **pañcamī vibhatti** (Ablative case, smā is singular, hi is plural).

(7) **sa, naṁ,** these two are called **chaṭṭhī vibhatti** (Genitive case, sa is singular, naṁ is plural).

Note that Dative and Genitive case are similar except in the meaning.

## Various Morphological Stages Of A Noun

(8) **smiṁ, su,** these two are called **sattamī vibhatti** (Locative case, smiṁ is singular, su is plural).

Vibhatti-icca'nena kvattho? By terming these vibhattis, what is the benefit? Amhassa mamaṁ savibhattissa se.

It has the benefit of making easy reference in Suttas such as 
"Amhassa mamaṁ savibhattissa se" etc.

Note: This Sutta shows all **14 vibhattis**. It is very important as it explains all fourteen noun-vibhattis or case-endings to be applied after every noun. All keen students need to try to familiarize with all fourteen of them. See the two tables and study it repeatedly until one clearly understands the way they are used as well as the way they are transformed into finished words after due procedures as enjoined by the rules of respective Suttas .

The first table explains everything related to noun vibhatti (caseendings of nouns) to be applied after them.

The second table shows a sample of morphological stages of the word
"**Purisa** (man) " which is an a-ending noun. By studying the table, the student will get an idea how each noun has to go through various stages of morphological change as enjoined by the rules of relevant Suttas 
(whose numbers are shown alongside in the table) until it becomes a complete word. Although these tables are not a complete guide to all the grammatical nuances and aspects, it will surely acquaint the student with all essential elementary facts of grammar and the structural morphology of words. If the students understand this, all procedures explained in this grammatical text will be much easier and simple to study and understand clearly.

## The Ending Of Nouns

All nouns are simply grouped according to their base-endings. These endings are called "Kāra'nta". [**kāra**-syllable+**anta**-the end. **i.e.** the end-syllable]
This is the vowel-ending of a noun in its initial base stage before all the necessary morphological procedures are done. Altogether, there are eight "Kārantas" in Pāli Language. They are **a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, o** and ṁ. There is absolutely no "e" **nor any consonant-ending** as in the Sanskrit grammars.

NOUN-ENDINGS BASED ON GENDER
(a) Seven Kārantas in the Masculine gender There are **seven Kārantas** in the Masculine gender. 

They are **a, ā, i, ī, u, ū** and o.

Examples in order of endings: To clarify, please see the last ending-vowel in each of these nouns. Purisa-man, Sā-dog, **Aggi**-fire, **Daṇḍī**-the one who has stick, **Setu**-bridge, Kataññū-the grateful person, Go-cow [Pronounce "Go" as "gaw"]
(b) Six Kārantas in the Feminine gender There are **six Kārantas** in Feminine gender. They are **ā, i, ī, u, ū** and o. Examples in order of endings:
Mālā-flower, **Ratti**-night, **Nadī**-river, **Yāgu**-porridge, **Vadhū**-daughter-inlaw, Go-cow [This word is a dual gender word]
(c) Seven Kārantas in the Neuter gender There are **seven Kārantas** in the Neuter gender. 

They are **aṁ, ā, i, ī, u, ū** and o.

Examples in order of endings:
Cittaṁ-mind, **Asaddhā**-the family without faith, **Vāri**-water, **Sukhakārī**-the happiness-making good deed, Āyu-life, **Gotrabhū**-the mind which transcends unenlightened state, **Cittagu**-the cow with color-streaks.

Note: In the Rūpasiddhi, it is stated "akāranto napuṁsakaliṅgo Cittasaddo" which means "the neuter-gender word **Citta** ending in a". However, many teachers rather prefer as "**aṁ-ending**" because it is a very outstanding mark of the neuter gender nouns found in the Pāli canon. In the Sanskrit grammars, there are not only vowel-endings, but also consonant-endings. In Pāli, all nouns are grouped only in vowel-endings though there are some affix-based nouns which can be assumed as the consonant endings such as those **ntu-**affixed ones and those which ends in an āra-morpheme. However, it has been grouped based on their base-ending of vowels by the traditional teachers of Pāli grammar.

## Temporary Terms For Some Endings

Some of the endings are given formal temporary terms such as "**gha, pa,**
jha and la" in order to carry out some specific morphological procedures.

Among such endings: (1) The "ā" **of ā-ending nouns of feminine gender** are given a formal temporary name "gha". [Re: Sutta 60]
(2) The "**i, ī, u** and ū" **of feminine gender nouns** ending in **i, ī, u** and ū are given the formal name of "pa". [Re: Sutta 59]
(3) The **i, ī, of masculine and neuter nouns** ending in i and ī, are given a formal name "jha" while **u, ū of masculine and neuter gender nouns** 
ending in u and ū are given a temporary formal name of "la". [Re: Sutta 58]

To show this example "Bhotiyo ayyāyo" is vocative noun in plural, not a singular "si". So, irrelevant to name as "ga" though it is a noun in vocative case. * bhotiyo ayyāyo! * bhotiyo ayyāyo-Oh Madams! vp. Ga-icca'nena kvattho? Ghate ca. What is the benefit by this term "ga"? (When setting out morphological rules), it has the benefit of 

making easy reference in Suttas such as "Ghate ca" and so on.

Note: There are two "si" vibhattis: (1) **paṭhamā** (nominative) **singular** vibhatti "si" and 
(2) an **Ālapana** (vocative) **Singular** "si". The second is also called "**gatermed si**" as it is named "ga" by this Sutta.

The purpose of naming "ga" **is to duly perform any necessary morphological procedure** as prescribed by the relevant Suttas. **It also enables to easily distinguish between the two** "si" **vibhattis,** one being nominative and the other vocative.

The nouns (of masculine and neuter genders) ending in "i-ī, u-ū" are to be formally termed "**jha, la**" respectively (by means of this Sutta).

Note:(1) the **i, ī** of i, ī-ending nouns of masculine and neuter gender are to be termed "jha" and
(2) the **u, ū** of u , ū-ending **nouns of masculine and neuter gender** are to be termed "la" by this Sutta.

The purpose of giving this formal temporary term of "jha, la" is for easy referencing in the relevant Suttas and to facilitate necessary morphological procedures.

Examples:
Isi-hermit, (i-ending noun) Daṇḍī-the one who has a stick, (ī-ending noun), Setu-Bridge, (u-ending noun), Sayambhū-Self-enlightened Buddha, (ū-ending noun).

[Benefit of this formal procedure] By terming "jha, la", all necessary procedures such as changing the applied vibhatti after each of these nouns into "no" etc., can be duly carried out.

Examples of Sutta
[i-ending nouns] - isino-of/for hermits. aggino-of/for fire. - gahapatino-of/for householder.

[ī-ending noun] - daṇḍino-of/for those who have stick. [u-ending nouns] - setuno-of/for bridge.

The component vowel "o" of "go" in Chaṭṭī plural "naṁ" changes into "ava". In addition, the Chaṭṭī plural vibhatti "naṁ" also changes into an "aṁ" in an Alutta compound noun (which comprises the word "go" being combined with a rear word "pati"). [go-cow+**pati**-lord]
 Note: This Sutta has two functions: (a) ava function and (b) aṁ function. See the example carefully to clarify it. **Alutta** compound means un-elided compound-noun whose trace of Vibhatti applied during the Samāsa process is not disappeared nor elided. As a result, the visible trace of vibhatti still remains in it. In the middle of this compound noun example **Gavaṁpati**, the trace of vibhatti "aṁ" still remains. [A-not+**lutta**-elided]
- gavaṁpati-the lord of cattle cn. Alutte'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "alutte" for?

When a consonant is being present behind, the *upasagga* word "ava" in the front, has to be conversely changed into "u" [as a way of grammatical morphology procedure known as "**tabbiparīta**"] (ta-that, **viparīta-**reversal).

 Summary: This Sutta changes ava into u. As a matter of morphological process, the **"ava"** is a base *upasagga* particle which normally changes into "o" (Refer to Sutta 50). Here, instead, it changes into "u".

This is called **tabbiparita**. This process does not occur always. Sometimes, in some instances, the **"ava"** remains unchanged. See below regarding the function of "ca". "u" is shown in bold. Assume that it is a reversely changed form of the *upasagga* word **"ava"**.

Dutiyā (accusative) singular "aṁ", applied after "**jha, la, pa-**termed nouns" and the "m" of some compound nouns, changes into a "niggahita-ṁ".

 Summary: This Sutta enjoins two functions:
(1) keeping aṁ of accusative, singular vibhatti as an aṁ, (2) changing an "m" of a component word "puma (male) " in a compound noun into a niggahita represented by a dot.

The purpose of first function is to show consistency of this "ṁ" pattern in the accusative singular cases of those jha, la, pa-termed, i, ī, u, ū-ending nouns without any further morphological change being applied or occurred.

As for the second function, it is to further transform the niggahita into "vagganta, **the end-letter** of vagga group" as prescribed in Sutta No. 31 of the Sandhi section.

Examples of "aṁ" function, 
(the first function on **Masculine Gender Nouns**) 
Note: All examples of both genders shown below are of as vibhatti.

[i-ending, jha-termed nouns] - aggiṁ-fire. - isiṁ-hermit.

- gahapatiṁ-householder.

[ī-ending, jha-termed nouns] - daṇḍiṁ-the one who has a stick.

- mahesiṁ-the holy Buddha.

[u-ending, la-termed nouns] - bhikkhuṁ-monk.

- paṭuṁ-the skilled person.

[ū-ending, la-termed nouns] - sayambhuṁ-the self-enlightened Buddha. - abhibhuṁ-the Buddha of overpowering capacities. 

(Feminine Gender Nouns) 
[i-ending, pa-termed nouns] - rattiṁ-night.

[ī-ending, pa-termed nouns] - itthiṁ-woman. [ū-ending, pa-termed nouns] - vadhuṁ-daughter-in-law.

Note that only "ṁ" is visible behind such **i, ī, u, ū-**ending nouns in accusative, singular case.

Examples of changing "m" **into niggahita**
(the second function **applied after la-termed u of puma)**
18
(Changed letters are shown in bold, underlined. All are compound nouns) 
- pulliṅgaṁ-the male-gender, male manner. [Here, m changes into
"ṁ" but it has to be changed into "l" by means of vā of Sutta 31. This is an anomalous morphological procedure]
- pumbhāvo-manhood. [Here, Niggahita changes into "m" as it precedes "bh." These two are *chaṭṭhī tappurisa* compound nouns]
- puṅkokilo-male Koel bird. [Here, Niggahita changes into "ṅ" as it precedes "k". This is a *kammadhāraya* compound noun]

## Morphological Process [Sm]

Pulliṅgaṁ=**puma**-male+**liṅga**-manner (the base structure)
Step (1) elide "a" of puma> pum+liṅga as per Sutta 222.

Step (2) "u" of puma is termed "la" by 58.

Step (3) By this Sutta, "m" is changed into "ṁ"> puṁ+liṅga Step (4) By "vā" of 31, "ṁ" is changed into an "l"> pulliṅga Step (5) recognize as a neuter gender noun and refer all the remaining procedures as explained for the word **citta** of the nominative singular in the appendex section of the volume one.

What is the word "jha,la,pehi" for?

To show that the examples shown below are not of jha, la, pa-ending nouns. So, the function is not applied as indicated by that word. (Those examples end in "a". So, they are not named jha, la, pa, but ordinary a-ending nouns in accusative case. That is why 
"aṁ" can still be seen clearly in them).

When various vibhattis such as "aṁ" etc., are applied and necessary morphological procedures are done, further pro-

cess of eliding the vowel and keeping morphed forms of the word in a state of "pakati", (**i.e.** keeping as it is without further morphological modification) is to be carried out. (This Sutta's function is broadly applied to all words in all chapters). This Sutta enjoins two functions:
(a) **the first** is eliding the vowels, morphemes and affixes etc., which need to be elided in the course of morphological change of words so that it becomes a complete word.

(b) **the second** is keeping a state of pakati as it is to prevent further action. In other words, it is like a stop-work order after the last major morphological procedure is done.

When pathamā, ālapana and dutiyā plural vibhatti "yo" had either been changed into "ni" or elided, the vowel in front of "yo", has to be made into a **dīgha,** i.e., to be lengthened.

The examples of yo-elided nouns See the lengthened vowels shown in bold, underlined

[u-ending feminine noun] - yāgū-rice-porridges. *np, ap*, [i-ending neuter noun] - aṭṭhī-bones. *np, ap*. [u-ending neuter noun] - āyū-lives. *np, ap*.

(In these examples above, yo is elided by undergoing a **lopa** process as per Sutta No.118. After elision procedure, short "i" "u" vowels are lengthened by this Sutta.) 

The examples of ni-function-applied nouns of neuter gender
(The lengthened vowels are in front of "ni") 
- aṭṭhīni-bones. - āyūni-lives. - sabbāni-all. - yāni-whichever things. - tāni-those. - kāni-whatever things. - katamāni-whichever things. - etāni-those. - amūni-so and so things. - imāni-these.

[All examples are of *np, ap.*]
Note: In these examples, "yo" is changed into "ni" as per Sutta No. 217 after which there is a **dīgha procedure** by this Sutta. See the lengthened vowel ī & ū in each examples located in front of "ni", shown in bold. It is quite simple to understand the function of this Sutta.

Caggahaṇa'mavadhāraṇa'tthaṁ. The *nipāta* word "ca" in Sutta restricts the function of this Sutta on the examples shown below. (So, there is no dīgha process in front of "su, hi" vibhattis)

When " **Su, naṁ, hi,** vibhattis" are being applied after numerical nouns such as Pañca etc., the component vowel thereof has to be remained in "a". Summary: This Sutta enjoins to keep the vowel "a" of Pañca etc as "a". No other functions such as lengthening etc, are allowed. 

This is a consistent pattern of such numerical nouns from Pañca to **dasa**. No specific change is applicable in these Vibhattis. That is why the vibhattis can be seen without any alteration to them or to any vowel before them. See the underlined vibhattis. One "n" is augmented in

Note: The second in each set of examples is inapplicable example.

To easily understand the function of Sutta, the difference between two examples regarding the function being applied or not applied are shown in bold-faced letters.

[See Sutta No. 176-177 to understand changing into "a"]
The function of Sutta keeps those **smā, smiṁ** vibhattis as it is. Hence, there are no "**amhā, amhi**" word-forms applicable in the ablative and locative singular cases. In the examples shown below, "**smā, smiṁ**"

Note: This Sutta debars three functions: changing smā into "**ā", smiṁ** into "**e", sa** into "āya" in a-ending Sabbanāma nouns. See the examples carefully to clarify this injunction. Practically, this Sutta restricts the function of Sutta No.108, and 109 in Sabbanāma nouns. In other words, the most Venerable Great Grammarian states that in a-ending masculine and neuter gender Sabbanāma nouns, there are no word-forms in **smā,**

* pāpā-from sin or evil abs. * pāpe-in sin or evil ls. * pāpāya-for accruing sin or evil ds. Caggahaṇa'manukaḍḍhana'tthaṁ. The word "ca" in the Sutta has a purpose of pulling in the word "ato" which comes from Suttas 103 all the way up to 104, 105,107, 108, 109 and 110 and withholding it here in this Sutta.

See the examples below where "yo" **is elided in the first examples.** The second one is inapplicable. That is why there is still a "yo" visible in it.

By means of it, the vibhatti "yo" becomes "no" in some words. (See "no" shown in bold) - jantuno-creatures, *np, ap*. Caggahaṇa'mavadhāraṇa'tthaṁ. The word "ca" in the Sutta has a purpose of restricting the function of Sutta in the examples shown below.

[V] Imasaddassa ca sabbasse'va attaṁ hoti vā sa,smā,smiṁ,saṁ,sā-icce'tesu sabbattha liṅgesu. The whole "ima" sometimes changes into "a" for all gender and in **sa, smā, smiṁ** vibhattis, also when **saṁ, sā** functions have already been applied after it.

Note: This Sutta sometimes changes "ima" of all genders into "a" in 
"**sa, smā, smiṁ**" vibhatti-cases or when "**saṁ or sā**" functions have been already applied. The function "a" is shown in bold, underlined. 

Out of a pair of each examples, the second * marked is inapplicable. 

The unchanged "ima" is shown in the second example. It is quite simple to understand.

[sa, m & n] - assa, * imassa-of this. [smā, m & n] - asmā, * imasmā. [smiṁ, m & n] - asmiṁ, * imasmiṁ. [smiṁ, feminine with Saṁ] - assaṁ, * imissaṁ. [sa, feminine with sā] - assā, * imissā. Imasaddasse'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "imasaddassa" for? To show that examples below are inapplicable as they are not "ima", but of "eta".

[Feminine] * etissaṁ, ls. * etissā. *ds, gs.*
Note: In view of the function of these two Suttas 176-177, it is clear that "a" is to be regarded as a derivative morpheme of either "ta" or "**ima".**
So, whenever one comes across such words as "assa" or "asmiṁ" and so on, correct interpretation should be made in accordance with context of the sentence.

Summary: This Sutta changes the last vowel of manogroup nouns such as **aya-**iron**, teja-**power and so on, which are joined in a compound noun into "o". This must be done after the applied vibhatti (case-endings) are deleted.

Note: The examples shown are compound nouns where the mano-

group nouns such as **aya, teja, tapa,** constitute the first component. Normally, most component words comprised in a compound process lost their distinctive genders, vibhattis (case-endings) as they have to be elided. But these groups can retain their salient characteristic "o" as per this Sutta even after it becomes a complete compound. (See the changed "o" shown underlined)

The entire word "**santa** (saint)", changes into "sa" when a morpheme "bhi" is present behind. Additionally, an extra "b" has to be added to "bhi". [Santa>sa+b+bhi>**Sabbhi**].

(See the function-applied examples shown in bold, underlined.) Note: There are two kinds of "bha": (1) one is a vibhatti-derivative morpheme bha from "bhi" as per Sutta No. 99.

(2) the other is just an ordinary bha of the root word bhu etc.

## The First Stanza

Examples in the stanza are shown in bold. Word-for-word detailed translation is provided for more detailed in-depth understanding of each word and the whole stanza.

- s**abbhi'**reva samāsetha, - s**abbhi** kubbetha santhavaṁ. sataṁ saddhamma'maññāya, seyyo hoti na pāpiyo.

(Sandhi) Sabbhi'reva= **Sabbhi**+eva. saddhamma'maññāya= saddhammaṁ+aññāya.

[Trans] **sabbhi**-with good people, or saints. *ip.* eva-only, ind. samāsetha-should congregate, or associate. āv. **sabbhi**-with good people, or saints. ip. kubbetha-should be done. *āv.* santhavaṁfriendship. as. sataṁ-of saints. gp. saddhammaṁ-noble teaching or noble way of saints. as. aññāya-having known, kv. seyyo-more noble. tn, *ns.* hoti-is. āv. na-not. *ind.* pāpiyo-evil or bad. *tn, ns.*
The First Stanza in English
(One) should associate only with the saints. The friendship should be done with the saints. Knowing the noble way of saints, Is more noble and is not evil.

The Second Stanza Jīranti ve rājarathā sucittā, atho sarīram'pi jaraṁ upeti. satañ'ca dhammo na jaraṁ upeti, santo have - s**abbhi** pavedayanti.

(Sandhi) sarīram'pi=sarīraṁ+api. satañ'ca=sataṁ+ca.

[Trans] Jīranti-gets old, dilapidated, āv. ve-really, *ind.* rājarathā-the king's chariots. *cn, np.* sucittā-wonderful. *cn, np, adj.* atho-besides, ind. sarīraṁ-the body. *ns.* api-also. *ind.* jaraṁ-to the (state of being) old. as. upeti-approaches. āv. sataṁ-of the saints. *gp.* ca-however, ind. dhammo-(the noble) Dhamma. ns. na-not. *ind.* jaraṁ-to getting old. as. upeti- approaches. āv. [**upeti=upa**-near+eti-gets, **i.e.** approaches.] santo-saints. np. have-in fact. *ind.* - sa**bbhi**-with saints. ip.

pavedayanti-made known, praise. āv.

The Second Stanza in English Really, the wonderful royal chariots of the king fall into decay. Besides, the body too gets old. But, the way of saints does not get old (by being out of fashion).

The saints, in fact, are to be known by saints (only).

The two examples below are compound nouns with an ordinary bha where the function of this Sutta is applied.

- sabbhūto-being a saint. *cn, ns.* [**santa**-saint+**bhūta**-being]
- sabbhāvo-being in a state of saint. *cn, ns.* [**santa**-saint+**bhāva**being in a state of. One more "b" is reduplicated]
Bhe'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "bhe" for? To show that example below is inapplicable as it does not have a vibhatti-morpheme "bh" of "bhi" in it. (Example shown below has only a "hi", not a "bhi") 
* santehi-by saints. ip. pūjito-is honored. kv. bhagavā-the Lord Buddha. (ns in accusative sense, passive voice sentence). i.e. Buddha is honored by saints.

Caggahaṇaṁ kvaci sakārasse'va pasiddhatthaṁ.

The word "ca" in the Sutta has a purpose of affecting to change "**santa**" into "sa" in certain words as shown below.

(See changed "sa" in both examples shown below. They are in Kitaaffixes) 
- sakkāro-the saint's act. *kn.* **i.e.** devotion, practice of Dhamma etc. 

[**santa**-saints+**kāro**-act]
- sakkato-by saints+done. *kv.* **i.e.** an act done by saints. [**santa**saints+**kato**-done. One more "k" is reduplicated in both examples]
Note: In both examples, sa is assumed to be derived from **santa**. However, it can also be derivative of an *upasagga* "saṁ-well, respectfully". 

In such case, sakkāro-means **act of devotion**. Sakkato-means done well, respectfully. This is widely found in the canonical texts. 

The words can be brought to completion by eliding the niggahita "ṁ" of *upasagga* and augmenting with one more "k".

A: The purpose of equating nta with ntu is to enable to perform necessary morphological procedures in the same way as ntu-affixed nouns, such as changing nta-affixed nouns into "**to, ti, tā**" and so forth.

[**to, ti, tā**" functions are shown underlined in the examples. Refer to Sutta 127 for this function.]

(3) "si" applied after the word "Satthu-teacher, rajā etc," changes into an "ā" (Refer to Sutta 199, 189).

The function of this Sutta is applicable only for nominative and vocative "si" vibhattis applied after some **i, ī, u, ū,** ending nouns. It is inapplicable for nouns which are applicable by the function of Suttas 104, 113, 114, 124, 125, 126, 152, 189, 193 and 219. In view of this procedure, it should be noted that both nominative, vocative singular vibhatti "si" **is usually invisible in majority of nouns of all genders** 
and declensions though traces of vibhatti-forms of other 13 vibhattiapplied nouns are still visible even after various kinds of morphological procedures have been applied.

## Traces Of Vibhatti-Forms

Shown below are traces of various Vibhattis (case-endings) except for nouns in "si" Vibhatti. Traces of unchanged vibhatti-forms are shown in bold.

Kaññāyo (Nominative plural "yo") 
Purisaṁ (Accusative singular "aṁ") 
Munayo (Accusative plural "yo")

221, 282. **Sabbāsa'māvuso'pasagga,nipātā'dīhi ca.**
[Sabbāsaṁ+āvuso, upasagga, nipāta-ādīhi+ca. 3 words]
[V] Sabbāsaṁ vibhattīnaṁ ekavacana,bahuvacanānaṁ paṭhamā, dutiyā,tatiyā,catutthī,pañcamī,chaṭṭhī,sattamīnaṁ lopo hoti āvuso,upasagga,nipāta-icce'va'mādīhi ca.

All (the singular and plural of "paṭhamā, dutiyā, tatiyā, catutthī, pañcamī, chaṭṭhī, sattamī") vibhattis, applied after upasagga and *nipāta* words, including the vocative particle "**āvuso**", are to be elided.

Summary: This Sutta enjoins to delete any vibhatti (caseendings) applied after *upasagga* and *nipāta* particles including the vocative particle "**āvuso**-my friend".

Q: Why **vibhattis** (case-ending of nouns) applied after *upasagga* and *nipāta* particles have to be elided? A: Because it is not necessary to apply any morphological function of structural and physical change to them.

Q: If to be elided, why then the vibhattis are applied after them?

A: It is applied as a rule of the grammatical necessity. A complete word in a meaningful sentence has to end in a certain vibhatti so that it can convey and signify its meaning according to the relevant vibhatti being applied even though it might had been either elided or changed into other newly-morphed forms. Q: Do all *upasagga* and *nipāta* **particles require to be applied with**
 Vibhattis?

A: Only those certain *upasagga* and *nipāta* words (which are used independently in a sentence as an individual word) are necessary to be applied with a Vibhatti. However, most of *upasagga* words used as prefixes of the verbs and verbal nouns are not required to be applied with Vibhattis.

Q: What kind of Vibhattis are generally applied **then?** A: Most are found to be applied with a nominative singular or plural. In cases of vocative words, vocative is applied. Some scholars state that nominative is usually applied after independent *upasagga* words and all seven vibhattis can be applied after independent *nipāta* words. However, it should be noted that **any relevant vibhatti can be applied after** 
them depending on the contextual position and the role each word plays such as adjective, adverb or disjunctive and so forth.

## 321 Examples Cited In Sutta

Tvaṁ - panā'**vuso**, (tvaṁ-you, - panā'**vuso=pana+āvuso,** pana-no meaning, āvuso-my friend? **i.e.** how about you, my friend? Singular) 
tumhe panā**'vuso,** (tumhe - panā'vuso=**pana+āvuso, i.e.** How about you? in plural sense here) 
- padaso dhammaṁ vāceyya, (He) should teach and say Dhamma word by word, **i.e.** in detail. **padaso**-by word, *is.* **dhammaṁ**-the dhamma, *as.* **vāceyya**-(one) should cause to say students, āv. **i.e.** teach. 

(a causative verb) vihāraṁ - sve upagaccheyya.

vihāraṁ-to the temple, *as.* sve-tomorrow, *nip.* **upagaccheyya**-(one) should approach. āv. **i.e.** (He) should come to the temple tomorrow.

(Pana, **āvuso,** and sve are *nipātas*. The rest are non-*nipāta* words. Both numbers of "si" and "yo" in vocative case can be applied to **āvuso** and must be elided. The word **āvuso** means "my friend", a peer-language used to address among equals of both monks and lay people alike. The nipāta "**pana**" has no meaning here though it has some distinctive meanings occasionally based on context of where it is positioned in a sentence. **Padaso** is a nā-vibhatti-ending word with indeclinable affix 
"so". Sve is a plain *nipāta* without an affix in the locative sense) 

## 20 Upasagga Words

(Important to be memorized by serious students) 
- Pa, - parā, - **ni, - nī,** - u, - du, **• saṁ, vi, ava, anu, pari, adhi,** abhi, pati, su, ā, ati, api, apa, upa. (These are called 20 *upasagga* words, with no vibhatti. However, *upasagga* words can affect various meanings **and usages when they are prefixed to the roots of verbs**.

## Upasagga Particles Prefixed In Front Of Roots

Below is only a sample of *upasagga* words prefixed to the roots "**hara**-to carry and bhū-to be" shown in the Sutta, thus forming various Kita-nouns. The *upasagga* **(prefix) words are shown underlined.**
- pahāro, - parābhavo, - nihāro, - nīhāro, - uhāro, - duhāro, - saṁhāro, - vihāro, - avahāro, - anuhāro, - parihāro, - adhihāro, - abhihāro, - patihāro, - suhāro, - āhāro, - atihāro, - apihāro, - apahāro, - upahāro, [These will be translated later. all ns.] evaṁ vīsati upasaggehi ca. Thus, (vibhatti are applied) after twenty upasagga words. [This is only a generalized statement. Except after some 

independently used *upasagga* words, the other *upasagga* words used as prefix such as these, do not require to have any vibhatti case-endings]
Note: Vibhattis are not elided in these examples shown above as they have become nouns. That is why there is an "o-ending" in these words. See each Upasagga is prefixed to the front of the root "hara or bhū" and becomes a complete word "**pahāro**" etc, after going through necessary morphological procedures. Note that the only example where the root "bhū" contains is "**parābhavo".** The rest are made up of one single root "hara".

## The Use Of Upasagga Particles

The meaning of each *upasagga* words in examples will be explained in some detail so that the students will be able to figure out some possible meaning of upasagga words they may encounter and develop some basic knowledge of them. Usage: *upasagga* words are generally used as prefixes placed before the roots of **Ākhyāta verbs** and Kita-affixed Kita-nouns. **There are quite a few** 
upasagga words which can be independently used. *nipāta* words are used in various places of sentences and words. When an *upasagga* word **or a** nipāta **word is used as an independent word** in a sentence, some **certain** 
vibhattis, especially nominative, can be applied. After application, the vibhattis are to be elided by this Sutta as a general rule of the grammar.

## Three Kinds Of Upasagga Particles

There are three kinds of *upasaggas*. They are: (1) Those that follow the meaning of the root, without affecting its original meaning. This kind of *upasagga* is called "Dhātva'tthā'nuvattaka".

[**Dhātu**-root+**attha**-meaning+anu-following+**vattaka**-that which happens]
(2) Those that absolutely mean opposite of the root. These categorically change the original meaning of the root. This is called "Dhātva'tthabādhaka". [Dhātu+**attha+bādhaka**-that which debars, is opposite of the meaning of the root.]
(3) Those that enhance the original meaning of the root by adding more specific meaning and flavor to it. This kind of upasagga is called "Dhātva'tthavisesaka".

[Dhātu+**attha+visesaka**-modifier or enhancer]

## Translation Of The Examples

Having explained the meanings of *upasagga* particles in some detail, it is now more simple and easy for the students to figure out and understand the meaning of *upasagga*-prefixed nouns in Kita-affixes shown as examples in this Sutta. The following is a translation of the example words of Sutta:
- pahāro-carrying (instruments of harm) specially, **i.e.** beating, striking. [pa-specially+hara-carrying+ṇa-suffix]
- parābhavo-loss, ruin. [**parā**-opposite+bhava-to be, being=ruin, loss] - nihāro, - nīhāro-taking out, evicting. [ni-out+hara-carrying] (Both ni and nī are the same)

[ā-toward+hara-carrying] - atihāro-carrying beyond or excessively. [ati-beyond, excessive+ hara-carrying] - apihāro-carrying down. [api-downward+hara-carrying]

Note: ā of the root "hara" is a vuddhi vowel which occurred due to the presence of a Kita ṇa-affix applicable in the examples.

## The Nipāta Particles

The *Nipāta* words or particles are many and varied throughout Pāli literature. They are so called as they can be found placed in the beginning, in the middle or at the end of sentences and words, but not as the prefixes of the roots.

[ni√**pata**-to fall. **i.e.** to be placed anywhere]. However, there are quite a few nipāta particles which are placed before some verbs or Kita-affixed nouns and similarly used like prefixes. Here are a few of them:
Antara-between, **Āvi, Pātu**-vividly, clearly. **Sacchi**-being a witness to, together. **Vinā**-without, being apart. **Saha**-together. **Puna**-again.

Examples in front of the roots and verbs:
(1) **Antara**dhāyati-(he) disappears. [Antara+dhāyati] (2) Āvikaroti-(he) makes it openly, displays clearly. [Āvi+karoti]
(3) **Pātu**bhavati-(It) arises visibly, **i.e.** appears. [Pātu+bhavati]
(4) **Sacchi**karoti-(he) realizes, **i.e.** attains. All are āv [Sacchi+karoti]
Examples in front of various nouns:
(5) **Vinā**bhāvo-separation, being apart. kn [Vinā+bhāvo]
(6) **Saha**cārī-the one who used be together, a friend. kn [Saha+cārī]
(7) **Puna**bbhavo-being born again, rebirth. kn [Puna+bhavo]
The following is a brief descriptive list of some *nipāta* words shown in this Sutta. **Some are plain** *nipātas* without any affix**, while some are with indeclinable affixes. Some may even have a sort of vibhatti-ending** in them. 

Any vibhatti applied after most of the *nipāta* words are generally elided. As a rare exception, some may still have traces of vibhattis. Please note that the implied meaning of elided vibhatti still remains in effect for some *nipāta* words such as **yathā, tathā and evaṁ** etc. To gain mastery of the language, the students should also study the meanings and usage of both *upasagga* and nipāta words in addition to the general aspects of grammar.

- yathā, - tathā-in a manner that, in such a way as [A combination of Sabbanāma noun "ya" "ta" with indeclinable affix "thā". The affix itself is expressive of manner or mood.]

- evaṁ-thus, in this way, true as it is said, yes. (Many meanings) [This nipāta is used in accusative-case ending "aṁ", very frequently used in Pāli texts.]
- khalu-used mostly in a reported narrative. - kho, a plain *nipāta*, mostly meaningless, but found often in main Buddhist texts. Used together with "atha" "evaṁ" "taṁ" etc. Sometimes it may mean 
"only, really".

- tatra-there, [a combination of Sabbanāma noun "ta" with indeclinable affix "tra".]
- atho-in addition, besides. - atha-now, then, later on, if. [Sometimes used in the beginning of a chapter or an episode, as an introductory or initiating word]
- hi-really, for, only. [Sometimes a meaningless particle.] - tu-in addition, only. [Also an expletive without meaning, sometimes added to be more emphatic in a statement.]
- ca-also, too. [It is used to express some additional meaning in grammatical texts. Sometimes meaningless. Sometimes it has a lot of meanings when used after other *nipāta* particles]
- vā-similar to either or, in other ways. [In grammatical texts, sometimes it is used to express other option or method or inconsistency of a function.

 Sometimes with no particular meaning.]
- vo-you. [It is sometimes a meaningless expletive.] - haṁ, - ahaṁ. the use of these two *nipāta* are seldom found in texts unless it means "I".

- alaṁ-is widely used to express:
 (a) enough, **(b)** suitable, **(c)** worthiness, **(d)** appropriateness, **(e)** ability. Also, **(f)** sometimes used as a prohibition or rejection, usually used in combination with (1) a **noun in instrumental case**, or (2) **tuṁ-infinitive** Kita **verbs** or (3) an **āya-infinitive in dative case** nouns.

- eva, equal to "only", used next to the word it want to modify or restrict or confirm in its implied meaning. [A plain *nipāta*.]
- ho!, - aho!, these are expression of interjection or surprise. No vibhatti. - he! - ahe! - re! - are!. Vocative *nipāta* particles, similar to "hey" in English. Usually vocative case vibhatti is applicable, but to be elided.

Eva'mādīhi nipātehi ca yojetabbāni.

Thus, after such and other *nipāta* words too, the function of this Sutta (**i.e.** elision of the applied vibhattis) should be applied. Caggahaṇa'mavadhāraṇa'tthaṁ. The word "ca" in Sutta has a purpose of affirming the function of the Sutta.

The whole word **bhavanta**-(your honorable), changes to "**bhota**" when a feminine-gender "ī" affix follows it. (See Sutta No. 238 for affix "ī". The example is only the word "Bhoti", not accompanying words. The affix "ī" is shortened which later becomes 
"Bhoti".) 
- bhoti ayye! - bhoti kaññe! - bhoti kharādiye! vs.

(Refer to Sutta No. 57 for the meaning of examples.) Note: The word "Bhoti" is a polite form of address to a female.

Note: "bho" is a vocative particle used before nouns of masculine gender, while "**bhoti**" is used for the nouns of feminine gender. 

Ge'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "ge" for? To show that the examples below are inapplicable as they 

are not "ga-termed si". They are of "nā" and ordinary "si" vibhattis.

By the word "tu" in Sutta, the word "**bhavanta**" can also change into " **bhonta, bhante, bhonto, bhadde, bhotā,** bhoto" in cases of other vibhattis.

- bhonta! vs. - bhante! *vs. vp.* - bhonto!-honorable sir!, vp, np, ap.

- bhadde!-Oh honorable lady! madam! vs. - bhotā-by honorable. is. - bhoto-of honorable person. *ds, gs.*
Note: Some of the functions applicable by means of **"tu"** are quite similar to the two Suttas mentioned in Rūpasiddhi and in earlier version of the text though not found in Myanmar and Sri Lanka versions.

See those two Suttas together with complete translation shown in the footnote.

## The Different Usages

of Vocative Form "Bhavanta".

(1) **Bhante** is generally used when addressing monks, ascetics and people of senior rank as a token of politeness.

(2) **Bhonta, Bhonto** are forms of both vocative particles used to address general class of people as a polite form of address.

(3) **Bhadde** is specifically used for addressing women of respect and to politely address one's wife or any woman.

[This means that those affixes have the same grammatical role of providing various meanings such as locative, ablative and so on in the same way just as the ordinary **vibhattis** do although they may assume morphologically unchanged forms.

To show that the examples below are inapplicable as the word "kvaci" restricts the function of this Sutta on some words like those shown.

Note: This Sutta elides the component vowel of the last consonant of a Taddhita-noun applied with a ṇya affix. The vowel is located right before "ya".

Note: "ya" affix in this Sutta refers to "ṇya" Taddhita affix whose "ṇ" has been elided and only "ya" remained after elision. (See Sutta No. 

360, 396). Those morphed consonants "**ca, la, ña, ja**" are reduplicated afterwards to become complete words. Sutta 261 & 269 are related to each other in performance of the necessary morphological procedure on these words. All the complex morphological procedures are explained below in a very simple, understandable way.

## Explanation

Now, let's take a closer look at morphological solution by taking four example words because each of them consists of ta, la, ṇa, da in them. (See those **ta, la, ṇa, da** letters shown in bold) 

Here they are: (a) paṇḍita-wise. (b) kusala-skill. (c) karuṇā-kindness. (d) suhada-good-heart. [su-good+**hada**-heart, **i.e.** goodwill]

## Step (A)

Because we want all these words to express "being in a state of" i.e. the abstract expression, an affix "ṇya" has to be applied after each word by **Sutta 360**. So, the basic structural pattern of each example becomes as follows: (a) - paṇḍita+ṇya. (b) - kusala+ṇya. (c) - karuṇa+ṇya. (d) - suhada+ṇya.

## Step (B)

Here are necessary **morphological procedures** to be carried out further. (1) First, let's elide "ṇ" of "ṇya-affix" in each example by Sutta No. 396 in Taddhita section. It will now look like this: (a) - paṇḍita+ya. (b) - kusala+ya. (c) - karuṇa+ya. (d) - suhada+ya.

(2) Second, by **Sutta 261**, all the vowel "a" of **ta, la, ṇa, da** are to be elided. It becomes like this: **t, l, ṇ, d.** No more "a" is left. See below how it may looks like now: (a) - paṇḍit+ya. (b) - kusal+ya. (c) - karuṇ+ya. (d) - suhad+ya.

(3) Now, combine these "**t, l, ṇ, d**" vowel-less plain consonants to ya (a residual trace of a ṇya-taddhita affix). Now, it will look like this: **tya, lya, ṇya, dya.**
See the examples carefully as shown. Remember what is said in the translation of Sutta which states: "Those **ta, la, ṇa, da** consonants of Taddhita nouns having a residual trace 'ya' of ṇyaaffix".

Also please refer to Pāli words in Vutti of Sutta which said: "Yavataṁ ta, la, ṇa, da **kārānaṁ (yavataṁ-**having a ya, talaṇada kārānaṁ-of those ta, la, ṇa, da letters)". This is what it becomes of now as shown here. The practical morphological solution and the explained rule of the Sutta are perfectly matched. See below how it all look now: (a) - paṇḍitya. (b) - kusalya. (c) - karuṇya. (d) - suhadya.

## Step (C)

(1) Now, let's perform next morphological procedure again.

This time, by this Sutta. We will change those ya-conjoined t, l, ṇ, d consonants into **c, l, ñ, j** consonants respectively.

(2) Now, here is the result: 
(a) ty> c> Augment it as per **Sutta 28** with another similar c> cca> - paṇḍicca.

 (b) ly> l > Augment it with a similar l> **lla>** - kusalla. (c) ṇy> ñ> Augment it with a similar **ñ> ñña**> - karuñña. (d) **dy> j >** Augment it with a similar j> **jja>** - suhajja. (3) Now, we need to do a **vuddhi** procedure by Sutta 400 on b, d and c. This means that vowel "u" of both b and d has to be changed into an "o" while "a" of "ka" in c is to be lengthened. Suppose it has been carried out now and finished. It will look like this: (b) - kosalla. (c) - kāruñña. (d) - sohajja. (Now, it is almost done, but not over yet).

(4) To finalize all this, let's do a formal recognition procedure of all this almost-finished words as noun by **Sutta 601** as these words are not actual nouns yet, but words in Taddhita-affix ṇya, in a state of morphological transit pending the completion. After this formal recognition as "nouns", a nominative singular "si" is to be applied after each word.

(5) Let's assume that all this is done and the words have been applied with "si" and will look like this:
- paṇḍicca+si. - kosalla+si. - kāruñña+si. **• sohajja+si**.

(6) Next, that "si" is to be further changed into an "aṁ" by **Sutta 219.** (Know that any noun affixed with a Taddhita affix
"ṇya" belongs to neuter gender group. As such, the "si" has to be changed into an "aṁ") Now, it will look like this: - paṇḍicca+aṁ. - kosalla+aṁ. - kāruñña+aṁ. - sohajja+aṁ.

(7) Then, all vowel "a" after each duplicated words (refer to cca etc.) before the plus sign + are to be elided and keep as a "pakati" by **Sutta 83** (keeping **pakati** means putting a stop to all further procedures. It also means that morphological procedures for these words are almost complete. **So, no more action!**).

(8) Then, vowel-less conjuncts are attached to next "aṁ" by means of **Sutta 11**. (A consonant can not be combined to two vowels at the same time. Hence, one must be elided.) Now, all the words become perfectly complete words with a distinctive gender and case-endings, ready to play any important role in the structure of a sentence and convey their relevant meanings. See the examples of Sutta as completed words shown below.

- bāhussaccaṁ (a state of having much knowledge).

 [**bahu-**much**+suta**-knowledge+ṇya]
 - paṇḍiccaṁ (a state of being wise). - vepullaṁ (a state of abundance). - kāruññaṁ (a state of being kind). - kosallaṁ (a state of being skilled). - nepuññaṁ (a state of having deep wisdom).

To show that the examples below are inapplicable as there is no "ta, la, ṇa, da", although they may have a "ya" in them. * ālasyaṁ-a state of being idle, **i.e.** laziness. [**alasa**-being lazy+ṇya-state] * ārogyaṁ-a state of being without disease, or being healthy. **i.e.** healthiness. [**aroga**-being healthy+ṇya] Byañjanāna'miti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "byañjanānaṁ" for? To show that the example below is inapplicable as there is no 
"byañjana-consonant", but an "ā" of vibhatti "nā" in the instrumental case.

* maccunā-by death (a plain noun). Kāraggahaṇaṁ kimatthaṁ? Yakārassa makārā'desañāpana'tthaṁ. What is the word "kāra" for? The word "**kāra** (refer to kārānaṁ)" in the Sutta, shows that the "y" (affix "y" of "ṇya") can change into an "m". (It has to be reduplicated later on. See the example below to clarify this. "m" is shown in bold.) - opammaṁ-similitude. [**upamā**-being similar+ṇya.] "u" becomes "o". Then, "ā & ṇ" are elided. "my" then becomes "m" and augmented as [opamma]. Afterwards, a nominative singular "si" is applied [opamma+si] and changed into "aṁ" [opamma+aṁ]. One "a" is to be elided. 

This is how the word is brought to completion by means of due morphological process.

A "smā" vibhatti applied after nouns such as **amha, tumha, ntu-affxed nouns, rāja, brahma, atta, sakha, satthu,** 
pitu etc, is to be regarded as an equal to ordinary "nā vibhatti" (so that any necessary morphological procedure applicable to an ordinary nā-vibhatti-applied nouns of instrumental case can be done in the same way as in an original nā-vibhatti-applied nouns.) 
Summary: This Sutta enjoins to recognize ablative singular "smā" as an equal of instrumental singular "nā". [amha] - mayā-from me. [all examples are *abs.*] [tumha] - tayā-from you.

[ntu-affixed nouns] - guṇavatā-from virtuous one.

[rāja] - raññā-from king. [Brahma] - brahmunā-from Brahmā, God. [atta] - attanā-from oneself. [sakha] - sakhinā-from friend. [satthu] - satthārā-from teacher. [Pitu etc.] - pitarā-from father. - mātarā-from mother. - bhātarā-from brother. - dhītarā-from daughter. - kattārā-from doer. - vattārā-from speaker. Etehī'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "etehi" for? To show that the example below is inapplicable as the word is not relevant to those shown in Sutta such as "amha, tumha, etc.".

(There is no need to recognize the vibhatti in it as a "nā". Actually, the vibhatti itself is an original "smā-vibhatti". Besides, there are no further morphological procedures needed for that word to be recognized as a 
"nā", except changing that smā-vibhatti directly into an ā).

* Purisā-from man. *abs.*
Note: The purpose of recognition by this Sutta is only to facilitate the necessary morphological procedures applicable for the 

Kaccāyana Pāli Vyākaraṇaṁ ordinary instrumental singular "nā" to be similarly applied on the ablative singular case smā-applied nouns too. However, the meaning of completed word will remain unchanged though. It has to be interpreted the same meaning of ablative, singular case "smā" such as "from, due to" etc. not "with, by".

## 374 272, 309. Datunaman Mupsÿgyogadi‰Vip C

272, 309. **Dhātunāmāna'mupasaggayogādīsva'pi ca.** [Dhātunāmānaṁ+upasaggayoga-ādīsu+api+ca. 4 words]
[V] Dhātunāmānaṁ payoge ca upasaggayogā'dīsva'pi ca taṁ kārakaṁ apādānasaññaṁ hoti. An expression of "**apādāna**" can also occur when used in the context of verbs with certain roots, nouns and some upasagga words and so on.

## Dhātūnaṁ Payoge Tāva:

First, (here are) the example of apādāna expression in the context of (certain) roots of verbs.

ji-iccetassa dhātussa **parā**pubbassa payoge yo asaho, so apādānasañño hoti.

When the root "ji" (to conquer) prefixed with **parā** is used together,
(the source from which) one is defeated, is named an **apādāna**. (Hence, it has to be in the ablative case to signify it). The root ji prefixed with parā means "being defeated, to lose in a fight or the struggle".

Taṁ yathā? For example:
- Buddhasmā-from Buddha. parājenti-(are) defeated. aññatitthiyā-(those) holding other views, heretics.

i.e. The heretics are defeated from (**i.e.** by) the Buddha.

Bhū-icce'tassa dhātussa papubbassa payoge yato acchinnappabhavo, so apādānasañño hoti.

When the root "bhū", prefixed with "pa" is used together (as a verb in a sentence), which means an initial **originating source** of a continuous occurrence, that source is an apādāna.

Taṁ yathā? For example, (1) - himavatā-from the mount Himavantā. pabhavanti-originate.

pañca-five. mahānadiyo-great rivers. **i.e.** The five great rivers originate from the mount Himavantā (Himālaya mountains from where rivers flow continuously). [**pabhavanti=pa√bhū+anti**]
(2) - anavatattamhā-from lake anavatatta. pabhavanti-originate. mahāsarā-the great lakes.

i.e. The great lakes originate from lake Anavatatta.

(3) - aciravatiyā-from the river Aciravatī. pabhavanti-originate.

kunnadiyo-The small creeks.

i.e. The small creeks originate from the river Aciravatī.

Nāmappayoge'pi taṁ kārakaṁ apādānasaññaṁ hoti.

When used in contexts of certain nouns, that noun can also be named an apādāna. [This is the most common type of apādāna]
Taṁ yathā? (1) - urasmā-from chest (womb). jāto-(was) born. putto-the son.

i.e. The son was born from chest (**i.e.** womb).

(2) - bhūmito-from earth. niggato-came out. raso-the taste (of fruit etc.). **i.e.** The taste came out from the earth.

(3) - ubhato-from both sides. sujāto-well-bred, well-born. puttoson. - mātito-from mother. ca-also. - pitito ca-from father's side also. **i.e.** also from mother's side, also from father's side, from both sides, the son was well-bred, well-born.

Here are three example words: 
- ubhato, - mātito - pitito which are affixed with an indeclinable affix "to". [See Sutta 248. This affix has an ablative sense.]

## Upasaggayoge Taṁ Kārakaṁ Apādānasaññaṁ Hoti.

When a word is used in the context of some *Upasagga* words, that word can also be an apādāna.

Taṁ yathā?

(1) **apa-**by skirting. - sālāya-from the rest house. āyanti-come.

vāṇijā-the traders. **i.e.** The traders come by skirting (avoiding) from the rest-house. [apa=taking off, by avoiding]
(2) ā-till, up to. - brahmalokā-the high heavens of Brahmā. saddothe sound. abbhuggacchati-rises up.

i.e. The sound (of applause) rises up to the high heavens of Brahmā.

(3) **upari-**above. - pabbatā-the mountain. devo-the rain. vassatipours. **i.e.** The rain pours above the mountain.

(4) - Buddhasmā-from Buddha. **pati-**on behalf of, representing.

Sāriputto-Venerable Sāriputta. dhammadesanāya-for the purpose of teaching Dhamma. bhikkhū-monks. ālapati-addresses.

temāsaṁ-for three months. **i.e.** representing (from) Buddha, Venerable Sāriputta addresses the monks in order to teach Dhamma for three months.

(5) ghata'massa - telasmā **pati** dadāti.

[ghata'massa=ghataṁ+assa] ghataṁ-ghee. assa-to that person. - telasmā-from sesame oil. **pati**-instead of. dadāti-(he) gives.

i.e. He gives him ghee instead of sesame oil.

(6) uppala'massa - padumasmā **pati** dadāti. uppalaṁ-white lotus. assa-to that person. - padumasmā-from red lotus. **pati**instead of. dadāti-(he) gives. **i.e.** He gives him white lotus instead of red lotus.

(7) kanaka'massa - hiraññasmā **pati** dadāti. kanakaṁ-gold.

assa-to that person. - hiraññasmā-from silver. **pati**-instead of. dadāti-(he) gives. **i.e.** He gives him gold instead of silver. Ādiggahaṇena kārakamajjhe'pi pañcamī-vibhatti hoti. By the word "ādi" in the Sutta, pañcamī vibhatti can be applied in the midst of Kāraka (sentence parts).

Note: This word "ādi" comes from "upasaggayog**ā'dī**sva'pi ca" in Sutta. See "ādi" is shown in bold.

Examples:
(1) ito-(starting) from this day. - pakkhasmā-from a pakkha of 15 days. vijjhati-shoots. migaṁ-deer. luddako-the hunter. Here, apādāna word "• pakkhasmā" is between "Ito" and "migaṁ", two Kārakas of ablative and accusative cases. **i.e.** Starting from today within 15 days, the hunter (is going to) shoot the deer and other games (in the forest).

(2) - kosā-from a distance of a Kosa. vijjhati-(he) shoots. kuñjaraṁ-the elephant. **i.e.** (He) shoots the elephant from (a distant of) a kosa.

(3) - māsasmā-from a period of a month. bhuñjati-(he) eats. bhojanaṁ-food. **i.e.** (He) eats food from (since) a month.

Apiggahaṇena **nipāta**payoge'pi pañcamī-vibhatti hoti dutiyā ca tatiyā ca. By the *upasagga* word "api" in Sutta, in addition to pañcamī vibhatti, **dutiyā (accusative case)** and **tatiyā (instrumental case)** can also be applied for **apādāna** expression when used in context of certain *nipāta* words.

Note: This word "api" comes from "upasaggayogā'dīsv**a'pi** ca" in Sutta. The "api" is shown in bold.

(1) **rahitā**-(riht;) except/abandoning. - mātujā-from son. puññaṁmeritorious deed. katvā-having done. dānaṁ-alms. deti-(he) 
gives. i.e. Having done meritorious deed without son, he gives alms.

Note: Usually majority of apādāna words are in ablative case

offers. **i.e.** He offers the robe to the monk. [Here, the monk is receiver. So, it has to be in dative case, thus signifying Sampadāna]
(2) - samaṇassa-of the monk. rocate-adorns. saccaṁ-truth. **i.e.** The truth adorns the monk. [Here, truth adorns the monk. So, the monk has to be in dative case]

i.e. Yaññadatta carries the golden-umbrella for (shielding) Devadatta.

Sampadāna'micca'ne'na kvattho? Sampadāne catutthī. What is the benefit by terming "sampadāna"? It has the benefit of ease of reference in such Suttas as: "Sampadāne catutthī" etc. Vā'ti vikappana'tthaṁ.

Dhātunāmānaṁ payoge vā upasaggappayoge vā nipātappayoge vā sati atthavikappanatthaṁ vā'ti padaṁ payujjati.

 The word "vā" is included in Sutta to allow other instances of sampadāna (rather than those examples shown here) applicable in context of certain roots, or nouns, or *upasagga* words, or *nipāta* particles and wherever applicable.

Note: Besides this root, other root of the similar meaning is also applied in the first example.

yassa akathitassa pucchanaṁ kammavikkhyāpanatthañ'ca, taṁ kārakaṁ sampadānasaññaṁ hoti, dutiyā ca.

When asking a question to the one who is muted (**re:** the example Nos. 

3, 4) and specifically telling one's emotions (kamma) to someone (**re:** 
example Nos. 1, 2), that person being silent, that someone being talked to, is called "sampadāna". (In such cases,) dutiya (accusative) case is also applicable in addition to catutthī (dative) case. See the examples carefully to clarify this explanatory sentence shown above. rādha-root example:
(1) ārādho'haṁ - rañño. [ārādho'haṁ=ārādho+ahaṁ] ārādho-(am pleased with). ahaṁ-I. - rañño-of the king.

(2) ārādho'haṁ - rājānaṁ-to king. [Here, accusative case is used as sampadāna, meaning the same] **i.e.** I am pleased with king.

Note: "**of &** to" are only the meanings reflective of the case.

(3) kyā'haṁ - ayyānaṁ aparajjhāmi. [kyā'haṁ=kiṁ+ahaṁ] kiṁ-What (wrong). ahaṁ-do I. aparajjhāmi-offend, insult. - ayyānaṁ-to the venerables. **i.e.** What do I offend against the venerables? **i.e.** what wrong or insult I did to upset you?

(4) kyā'haṁ - ayye aparajjhāmi. [Here, accusative plural case, is applied for sampadāna, meaning the same, in place of dative case]
Note: Both examples 3 & 4 are the types of usage and words said as a question of inquiry to the monks who remain silent without giving any polite response despite the repeated act of respectful greeting.

ikkha-root example:
(1) cakkhuṁ - janassa dassanāya taṁ viya maññe. cakkhuṁ viya-like the eye. - janassa-of people. dassanāya-to see. taṁthat Venerable one. maññe-I think or it seems like. **i.e.** It seems that for people to see that Venerable one is like their only sight (at this moment).

(2) - āyasmato - upālitherassa upasampadā'pekkho upatisso. - āyasmato - upālitherassa-of Venerable Upāli, upasampadā'pekkho-considering to get ordained. upatisso-(the monk-to-be, a postulant) Venerable Upatissa. **i.e.** The postulant Upatissa is considering (wanting) to get ordained 
 (under the preceptorship) of Venerable Upāli.

Note: In this sentence, - āyasmato - **upālitherassa** are two words of sampadāna in dative case. The word "**āyasmato**" is an adjective which modifies the next word. It equals to "Venerable", a form of respectful term used to address those senior ones. Its original base-word is actually
"**āyasmā**". It is a **Taddhita noun** with "**mantu**" affix which means "the one having long life". See **Sutta 371** for detail.

(3) - āyasmantaṁ vā [sampadāna in accusative case] icce'va'mādi.

Note: The word "**• upālitheraṁ**" is omitted in this example. In this example, sampadāna word "• āyasmantaṁ" is in accusative case though the meaning is the same. The next word "• **upālitherassa**" of the first sentence **has to be in accusative case too.** So, it will be "**• āyasmantaṁ** - upālitheraṁ". Thus making two sampadāna words to complete the meaning.

Paccā'suṇa anupatigiṇānaṁ pubbakattari–Examples of sampadāna in the context of verb with the root "su-to listen to, prefixed with **pati** and ā", also the root "ge-to sing, prefixed with anu and **pati**
upasaggas":
suṇotissa paccā'yoge yassa kammuno pubbassa yo kattā, so sampadānasañño hoti.

The subject of first object, which is related to a verb with the root "su-to listen to, prefixed with **pati** and ā", is (to be herein) named a sampadāna.

Taṁ yathā? For example, bhagavā bhikkhū eta'davoca [eta'davoca=etaṁ+avoca] 
(an active voice sentence) 

bhagavā-the Lord Buddha. bhikkhū-monks. etaṁ-this word. avoca-said. **i.e.** Buddha said this discourse to the monks.

Note: In the above sentence, there are two objects (Kammas). They are bhikkhū (the monks) and **etaṁ** (this word, **i.e.** discourse).

Below is a grammatical explanation given by the great Grammarian Kaccāyana regarding the preceding sentence.

bhikkhū'ti-the word "Bhikkhū". akathita kammaṁ-is called akathita kamma (non-principal object). **etan**'ti-the word "etaṁ". kathitakammaṁ-is called kathita kamma (the principal object).

Note: The student has to basically understand the nature of active and passive voice sentences in order to clearly understand "the principal and non-principal role of the subject and object which are determined according to the voice of a sentence. Please refer to "The formative system of Pāli Verbs" in Ākhyāta chapter, explained at the end of first section.

Yassa kammuno pubbassa yo kattā, so **bhagavā**'ti "yo karoti sa kattā" ti suttavacanena **kattu**sañño.

Of the two Kammas (objects), the word "**bhagavā**" which is subject of the first Kamma (Re: Bhikkhū) is named **Kattā** (doer, the one who does the action of saying the discourse to the monks) by the grammatical principle as stipulated by the Sutta "yo karoti **sa kattā**".

Evaṁ yassa kammuno pubbassa yo kattā, so sampadānasañño hoti.

Thus, the subject of the first Kamma (after changing its role as a Subject) is named a sampadāna. **i.e.** it becomes a sampadāna.

Taṁ yathā? For example, Note: Below, there are two examples. In the first example, the verb is "**paccassosuṁ** (pati√ā√su+uṁ) ". Here, the root "su" is prefixed with **pati** and ā. In the second, the verb is "**āsuṇanti** (ā√su+ṇā-affix+anti) ". Here, the root word "su" is prefixed with an ā.

(1) te bhikkhū - bhagavato paccassosuṁ. te-those. bhikkhū-monks. - bhagavato-(to the word) of Buddha. paccassosuṁ-listened or responded in affirmative.

 **i.e.** Those monks listened (responded) to the Buddha.

Note: In this sentence, the word "**bhagavā**" in the first sentence becomes a Sampadāna by changing its case into dative case as "bhaga vato" as it receives the respectful attention (**i.e.** response) of the listener monks.

(2) āsuṇanti - buddhassa bhikkhū. āsuṇanti-(attentively) listen. - buddhassa-of Buddha (to the Buddha). bhikkhū-monks.

 **i.e.** The monks (attentively) listened to the Buddha.

Note: In this sentence, "**Budhassa**" is a synonymous with bhagavato.

## Explanation

In the foregoing sentence "**Bhagavā bhikkhū eta'davoca**", the word "**Bhagavā**" is Subject. In the latter two sentences above, - **bhagavato** and 
- **Buddhassa** are **Sampadānas** in dative case. Now, it can be clearly seen that the word "**Bhagavā**", which had played the role of being a Subject in the first sentence, becomes a Sampadāna in next sentence when used in the context of the verb "**paccassosuṁ**" and here, the root "su" is prefixed with **pati**
and ā. In the second sentence, the Sampadāna word "**Buddhassa**" is a synonym of 
"**Bhagavato**" in the same case, playing the same grammatical role as a Sampadāna in the sentence used in the context of the verb "**āsuṇanti**". Here the root word "su" is prefixed with "ā".

Giṇassa anu,pati,yoge–Examples of Sampadāna in the context of verb with the root "ge-to sing, prefixed with anu and **pati** *upasaggas*".

yassa kammuno pubbassa yo kattā, so sampadānasañño hoti.

(Here too) the subject of the first Kamma word, is named Sampadāna.

Taṁ yathā? For example, bhikkhu janaṁ dhammaṁ sāveti. bhikkhu-monk. janaṁ-people. dhammaṁ-Dhamma. sāveti-causes it heard. **i.e.** The monk preaches dhamma to the devotees. [Causative sentence]
Note: In this sentence, the word "**Bhikkhu**" played the role of Subject. In next sentences below, it will become a Sampadāna word changing its case into dative as "**Bhikkhuno**". Please note that the word "**tassa**" also is a Sampadāna as it serves as an adjective of "**Bhikkhuno**".

(1) - tassa - bhikkhuno-(to the word) of that monk. jano-people. anugiṇāti-repeats after him. [anugiṇāti-anu√ge+ṇā+ti]
i.e. People repeat (say in chorus) after that preacher monk.

(2) - tassa - bhikkhuno jano patigiṇāti-rejoins in unison giving him (to the monk) appreciative words of Sādhu. **i.e.** People rejoin (in unison, giving) that monk appreciative words (such as saying Sādhu etc.).

[patigiṇāti-pati√ge+ṇā+ti]

## Explanatory Stanza

Yo vadeti sa **'kattā'**ti, vuttaṁ **'kamman'**ti vuccati. yo paṭiggāhako tassa, **'sampadānaṁ'** vijāniyā. The one who says, is to be known as **Kattā**, the subject. That which is said, is called **Kamma**, the object. The receiver of that said word, should be formally known as "**sampadāna**". Icce'va'mādi. and so on.

"to-infinitive". Here, the sampadāna words are **āya** and **yā-ending nouns.** They are result-descriptive, formally called "**ta'dattha**" words. See all the examples carefully to clarify this grammatical concept of "ta'dattha sampadāna". [**ta'datthe=taṁ**-that+**atthe**-result]

Kvaci dutiyā, tatiyā, pañcamī, chaṭṭhī, sattamya'tthesu ca. In some instances, the expression of sampadāna can also happen in the sense of dutiyā (accusative), tatiyā (instrumental), pañcamī (ablative), chaṭṭhī (genitive) and sattamī (locative).

 **i.e.** vibhatti case-ending. The **appositional** visesana]
(2) Bhinnā'dhikaraṇa Visesana [**bhinna**-dissimilar+**adhikaraṇa**position, **i.e.** vibhatti case-ending. **Non-appositional** visesana]
Both play important roles in the structure of a sentence. Both are qualifier adjectives in different word-forms playing the same role.

The former qualifies a noun of similar case-ending while **the latter** qualifies a noun of different case-ending. In this Sutta, only the latter is to be taken as the referred visesana to be applied with a tatiyā (instrumental case).

## Gender And Number

A Visesana has its pair component-word known as "**Visesya** or Visesitabba" which means "the qualified". They are related to each other as the qualifier and the qualified in terms of syntactical relationship and have to be of similar gender and number for the tulyā'dhikaraṇa visesana. The gender and number are usually determined by "Visesya or **Visesitabba** (the modified)" word. In order to simplify and make it clearly understandable for the students, here is some more detailed explanation on practical aspects: (a) If the word qualified is of masculine gender and singular, its qualifier word "Visesana" has to be also of the same masculine gender and singular in number. If plural, both has to be plural. Example: (1) **abhirūpo puriso-**the handsome man. (singular) (2) **abhirūpā purisā**-the handsome men. (plural) 
Here, the qualified word or Visesya is **puriso,** a noun belonging to masculine gender and singular in number. The qualifier word (visesana) is "**abhirūpo**". So it has to follow gender and number of the word it qualifies. 

In example 2, the qualified word is plural. So, it has to be in plural too.

(b) If the qualified is of feminine gender and singular, its qualifier word "visesana" has to be of feminine gender and singular. If plural, both has to be of the same numbers.

Example: (1) **abhirūpā itthī**-the beautiful woman. (2) **abhirūpāyo itthiyo**-the beautiful women.

Here, the qualified word or visesya is **itthī**, a noun belonging to feminine gender and singular in number. The qualifier word (visesana) is "**Abhirūpā**". So, it has to follow gender and number of the word it qualifies. 

In example 2, the qualified word is plural. So, it has to be plural.

(c) If the qualified is of neuter gender and singular, its qualifier word "visesana" has to be of neuter gender and singular. If 

plural, both has to be of the same numbers. Example: (1) **abhirūpaṁ pupphaṁ**-the beautiful flower. (2) **abhirūpāni pupphāni**-the beautiful flowers.

Here, the qualified word or visesya is **pupphaṁ**, a noun belonging to neuter gender and singular in number. The qualifier word (visesana) is "**abhirūpaṁ**". So it has to follow the gender and number of the word it qualifies. In example 2, the qualified word is plural. So, it has to be plural. As bhinnā'dhikaraṇa visesana is applicable visesana in this Sutta, it doesn't have to be of similar gender and numbers. The examples themselves will clarify this.

When certain verbs based in roots such as gamu, budha, bhuja, paṭha, hara, kara, si, are used in a causative sentence, **dutiyā** vibhatti (accusative case) is sometimes applied after the noun denoting the Kamma (a subordinate object of the causative verb).

Note: The injunction of this Sutta reflects only a common pattern of case-endings applicable after sub-ordinate object in a causative sentence. This kind of object is called a causative-object or sub-ordinate object (Kārita-Kamma or payujjita-Kamma). In addition to dutiyā-vibhatti (accusative) case, other cases such as **tatiyā** (instrumental) and chaṭṭhī (genitive) cases can also be applied after the causative-object. Please see the underlined words below which denote causative object in three case-endings. This is generally observed grammatical rule regarding applicable vibhatti case-ending of the causative objects. (1) puriso-man. - purisaṁ-to the other man. - gāmaṁ-to village.

## Niddhāraṇa-Catukka (Niddhāraṇa-Quadriad)

According to traditional teaching of grammar devised by teachers, there are four Niddhāraṇa-related things which all students of Pāli grammar should understand. They are called NiddhāraṇaCatukka. Namely:
(1) Niddhāraṇa-samudāya (The selection-group) (2) Niddhāraṇa (Act of Selection) (3) Niddhāraṇiya (The selected) (4) Niddhāraṇa-hetu (The reason of selection) 
Of the three, (1) The group of people, animals or inanimate-things from which selection is being made is called **Niddhāraṇa samudāya.**
(2) Making selection by act of pointing out the distinctive quality of someone or something is Niddhāraṇa.

(3) Someone or something being selected for purpose of comparison is called Niddhāraṇiya.

(4) The distinctive qualities are **Niddhāraṇa-hetu** (the reason for selection).

 The function of this Sutta is applicable only after Niddhāraṇa-samudāya.

This means that when making a selection for distinctive comparison, either chaṭṭhī or sattamī vibhattis in plural are to be applied after nouns which denote Niddhāraṇa-samudāya (group from which selection is made).

## Explanation

Example: Kaṇhā - gāvīnaṁ sampannakhīratamā.

(1) In the example above, the word "**gāvīnaṁ**" which indicates the group of cows, is **Niddhāraṇa-samudāya.** That is why a chaṭṭhī vibhatti, plural number, is applied after it. [**niddhāraṇa**-selection+**samudāya**-group]
(2) The words indicative of selection "**sampannakhīratamā**" is Niddhāraṇa, which is a statement of distinction. [ni-out+**dhara**-to take+yu-act of]
(3) The word "**Kaṇhā**" which indicates black cow is **Niddhāraṇiya** (the selected animal for its distinctive quality of milk).

[ni+dhara+**anīya**-that which is being selected]
(4) The distinctively delicious sweet taste of the milk produced by black cow is **Niddhāraṇa-hetu** (reason of selection. **Hetu**-reason) 
Now, the students can also easily analyze other niddhāraṇa examples based on this clear and simple explanation.

305, 323. **Anā'dare ca.** [Anādare+ca. 2 words]
[V] Anā'dare **chaṭṭhī**vibhatti hoti, **sattamī** ca.

When expressing disrespect (in the context of two concurring actions, one being neglected, the other proceeding to perform an action regardless) either a **chaṭṭhī** (genitive case) or **sattamī** vibhatti (locative case) can be applied after both the noun denoting "anādariya, the disrespected" and after its correlative word. [**anā'dara=na**-without+**ādara**-respect, disregard]
Note: Please note that only one of chaṭṭhī or **sattamī** vibhatti in the same number can be applied. See the sample sentences and examples below. Unlike in the Niddhāraṇa

expression, both singular and plural numbers are applicable in this "anādara expression".

(1) - rudato-while crying, cgs. - dārakassa-the boy's (the boy), cgs. pabbaji-(the father) renounces, āv. [chaṭṭhī, singular example] **i.e.** While the boy is crying, the father renounced (to become an ascetic or a monk).

(2) - rudantasmiṁ-when crying, cls. - dārake-the boy, cls. pabbaji.āv.

[sattamī, singular, example] **i.e.** At the time (or as) the boy is crying, the father renounced (to become an ascetic or a monk).

## Anā'Dara-Catukka (Anādara-Quadriad)

Here too, there are four Anādara-related things the students of Pāli grammar should thoroughly understand. They are called anādara-catukka. Namely: (1) Anādara (act of neglect) (2) Anādaravanta (anādara-correlative) (3) Anādariya (the neglected) (4) Anādariyavanta (anādariya-correlative) 
Of the three components, (1) The action of neglect to living things or inanimate-things is called anādara. In this case, it is usually a verb, expressive of such action.

(2) Any word which is related to that act of anādara, such as the one who commit such act is called **anādaravanta.** It is usually a subject or a word denoting it. [anādara+vanta. See Sutta 368 for this suffix "vantu"]
(3) Someone or something being neglected is called **anādariya.** [anādara+iya] (4) Any word syntactically related to it as a verb (usually an auxiliary verb) 
etc. is called **anādariyavanta.** [anādariya+vanta]
The function of this Sutta is applicable only after anādariya and its correlative. This means that chaṭṭhī or sattamī vibhattis are to be applied after the nouns which denote anādariya and its correlative words.

## 429 Explanation

Example: - Rudato - dārakassa pitā pabbaji.

While the boy is crying, the father renounces. **i.e.** left (to become an ascetic). [The word "**pitā**-father" is added to make the sentence more complete]. (1) In the example above, the word "**dārakassa**" which indicates the neglected, crying boy, is "**anādariya**-the disrespected or the neglected". That is why a chaṭṭhī, singular "sa" vibhatti is applied after it. (2) The word indicative of the boy's crying act "Rudato" is **anādariya-cor-** relative which is related to "dārakassa". A similar chaṭṭhī vibhatti is to be applied after it as it is **anādariya-correlative.** [Re: Sutta 187, 127, to understand the morphological procedure of this word]
(3) The word "**pitā-**father" which indicates the father who renounces home without compassionate regard for the crying boy is **anādara-correlative**
 (the neglector, which plays the role as a subject).

(4) The word "**pabbaji**" which indicates "renouncing act" is **anādara** (a verb related to the subject as the doer of disrespectful act).

Now, students can also easily analyze the second example by being based on the explanation of this example.

Note: Despite it may literally mean "non-respect", the actual purpose of this grammatical concept of "**anādara**" is to describe two concurrent actions going on (sometimes in a pitiful, frustrating manner), not in the sense of intentional disrespect.

Here is one more relevant example to clarify this: E.g. Ñātīnaṁ pekkhataṁ maccu ādāya gacchati.

While the relatives are looking on, the death goes (away) by snatching (the loved one).

This example is very simple and vividly clear to understand. While relatives are looking on, or desperately thinking about what they can do for their sick, almost dying, beloved one who is lying on the bed, death invisibly takes away the loved ones as if snatching by force. In this example, (1) the words "ādāya gacchati-goes by snatching" are anādara. (2) the word "maccu-death" is an anādara-correlative. (3) the word "ñātīnaṁ-the relatives" is anādariya. (4) the word "pekkhataṁ-while looking on" is its correlative
(anādariyavanta). Both are in chaṭṭhī (genitive) plural case.

Regarding the word "pekkhataṁ", please refer to Sutta No.187, 128 on how this word is brought to completion through due morphological procedures. It is hoped that the students will clearly understand this seemingly complex grammatical concept and will be able to write such sentences on their own without much difficulty.

Note: These kinds of chaṭṭhī are called the genitive-in-instrumental, the genitive-in-locative sense, which are found the Pāli texts.

Examples of the Genitive in Instrumental **sense:**
(1) kato-done. - me-by me. kalyāṇo-the good deed (meritorious deed).

i.e. The good deed (is) done by me.

(2) kataṁ - me pāpaṁ-unwholesome, bad deed.

i.e. The bad deed (is) done by me.

Evaṁ tatiya'tthe. Thus, (these examples in genitive case) are in the sense of instrumental. Note: Please do not be confused with ordinary instrumental which normally means "with". In this Sutta, it only means **instrumental subject** which means "by", mostly found as the meaning of subjects used in passive voice sentences. This type of word in genitive case, but whose meaning is the instrumental subject "by", is usually referred to as "Katv'attha-chaṭṭhī" in grammatical terms. Such words usually play similar role of the subject in a passive voice sentence as the verbs they syntactically related to are structured using an affix of Kamma-sense only. This is one of a very delicate point of grammar.

[Katv'attha-chaṭṭhī=**kattu**-subject in instrumental+**attha**-sense. **chaṭṭhī**genitive-case word which has the sense and role of a Kattā, i.e. **Subjectgenitive, or agent genitive**].

Examples of the Genitive in Locative sense:
(1) kusalā-(are) skillful. - naccagītassa-in dancing and singing. sikkhitā-trained. cāturitthiyo [cāturitthiyo=cāturo+itthiyo], cāturo- beautiful (c;tuyR -shrewdness, lovely). itthiyo-women. **i.e.** the pretty women skilled and trained in dancing and singing.

(2) kusalo-(are) skillful? tvaṁ-you. rathassa-of chariot. - aṅgapaccaṅgānaṁ-in (things related to) various components.

When a subject is being engaged to time and action (of the two concurring incidences), a **sattamī** vibhatti (locative case) is to be applied.

## Explanation

When expressing two concurrent actions using time or action 
(an event) as a correlative marker, and with a subject being involved in the act, a **sattamī** vibhatti is applied after the noun denoting time, or action along with the corresponding subject or the object of the action. This Sutta enjoins to apply a sattamī vibhatti after the subject **or the object** and **the verb** denoting coinciding action or event. In such a sentence, the verb is usually nta, māna or ta-suffixed **Kita verbs** though Ākhyāta verbs are sometimes used to express the last action out of the two concurring actions in a precise and simple manner. See the examples below carefully to understand this seemingly complex grammatical concept and its applied function in the practical sentence.

## Example Of Kāla-Lakkhaṇa (Time-Definitive Concurrent Action)

(1) - pubbaṇhasamaye-in the morning. gato-(he) went. (First action) 
- sāyanhasamaye-in the evening. āgato-(he) comes. (Subsequent incident) **i.e.** He went in the morning. In the evening, he came back.

## Example Of Bhāva-Lakkhaṇa (Action-Definitive Concurrent Action)

(1) - bhikkhūsu-(when) the monks, clp - bhojīyamānesu-(are still) eating, clp. gato-(he) went, kv. **i.e.** When the monks are still eating, he went. - bhuttesu-having eaten (when they finished eating), clp. āgato- (he) came back. kv. **i.e.** When having eaten, he came. (When the monks finished eating, he came back).

(2) - gosu-(when) cows. clp - duyhamānesu-(are being) milked. clp.

 gato-(he) goes, **i.e.** When the cows are still being milked, he goes.

- duddhāsu-when milked (when milking is done), clp. āgato-(he) 
 came back. **i.e.** When having milked, he came. (When milking is done, 

 he came back).

Note: In these two examples, the **present passive participle** is used in the first incidence while the **past passive participle** is employed in the next incidence. Please note carefully this delicate mode of sentence structure.

## Lakkhaṇa-Catukka (Lakkhaṇa-Quadriad)

There are four Lakkhaṇa-related things which all the students of Pāli grammar should understand so that they will have a clear and comprehensive understanding of this grammatical concept. They are called lakkhaṇa-catukka. Namely: (1) Lakkhaṇa (the act of first marking) (2) Lakkhaṇavanta (lakkhaṇa-correlative) (3) Lakkhya (the concurring act called "the marked") (4) Lakkhya-vanta (lakkhya-correlative) 
Of these four, (1) When an ongoing primary event and another secondary incidence are taking place at the same time, the primary event is used as a marker of the secondary event. Such act of marking is called "**Lakkhaṇa**" by the ancient grammarians which means "the mark". (2) Its correlative word, either it be a subject or an object that is syntactically related to it, is called "**Lakkhaṇavanta**". (3) The secondary incidence, is termed "**Lakkhya**". (4) Its correlative word, either it be a subject or an object, is called "**Lakkhyavanta**".

The function of this Sutta is to apply sattamī vibhatti (locative case) after
"Lakkhaṇa and Lakkhaṇa-correlative", so that it becomes a complete and meaningful sentence when expressing two concurrent actions.

## Explanation

Example: - bhikkhūsu - bhojīyamānesu puriso gato.

While or when the monks are eating, the man goes. ["**puriso**-man" is added for completeness's sake of the sentence] Here, the man's going incidence is marked by the primary event of the monks' eating.

(1) In the example above, the word "**bhojīyamānesu**" which indicates the primary event of the monk's eating, is **Lakkhaṇa** by means of which the 

 man's going is marked. (2) The word "**bhikkhūsu**" is its correlative object. Therefore, both are in the locative, plural case of sattamī vibhatti.

(3) the word "**gato**" which indicates the secondary action of man's going, is
 "**Lakkhya**". (4) The word "**puriso**" is its correlative which serves as a subject "goer". These two words are inapplicable by the rule of this Sutta.

## The Injunction Of Suttas 305, 313

The Sutta 305 and 313 enjoins the two prevalent grammatical rules regarding the expression of two simultaneous actions, one based on the concept of "anādara" and the other based on time and action as definitive markers. Regardless of what has been explained in two Suttas, the students should know that there are also some methods of expressing two concurring incidences using relative pronouns and short sentences. The sentence structures based on the rules enjoined by these two Suttas are far more concise and needs less word. It should also be noted that even though there is no element of disrespect nor any definitive marker, one can still write the sentences based on the rules enjoined by these Suttas. Although it may at first seem a bit complex to the beginner, it is hoped that all the necessary simple explanation given thus far will suffice to make these two complex injunctions clear and simple to understand.

When used in the context of certain *upasagga* particles such as upa and **adhi,** meaning **over** and **the lord** respectively, a sattamī vibhatti (locative case) is applied (to its correlative noun qualified by those *upasaggas*).

Note: *Upasagga* words applied in the sentence have specific meanings which can thereby affect the case-ending of the nouns they are related to. See the case-endings of each example carefully to clearly understand this Sutta's function.

(1) upa-(is) over, in excess. - khāriyaṁ-than a measure of "khāri". 

doṇo-a measure of "doṇa".

 i.e. A measure of "doṇa" is in excess of a "khāri". (A "doṇa" is more than a "khāri").

Note: "khāri" and "doṇa" are measurement units of the grain in ancient India.

(2) upa-(is) over, in excess. - nikkhe-than a measure of "nikkha". kahāpaṇaṁ-the measure of "kahāpaṇa".

i.e. A measure of "kahāpaṇa" is in excess of a "nikkha". 

 (A "kahāpaṇa" is more than a "nikkha") 
Note: "nikkha" and "kahāpaṇa" are measurements of the monetary units in ancient India just as cents and dollar are common monetary units.

(3) **adhi**-(is) the retinue. - brahmadatte-of the king Brahmadatta. pañcālā-(the people) of Pañcāla.

i.e. The people of Pañcāla are retinue of the king Brahmadatta.

Note: Though this example is mostly found in the texts, "adhi brahmadatto pañcālesu. **i.e.** The king Brahmadatta is the lord of the people of Pañcāla" is also applicable text. In the grammatical rule, the word denoting the lordship or dominancy is in nominative case and the word denoting the subject of lordship or "the dominated" is usually in the locative case. Comparing with next two examples will clarify this fact which conform to this usage pattern and grammatical norm.

(4) **adhi**-(is) the lord. - naccesu-over the dancers. gotamī-(a lady named) Gotamī. **i.e.** Gotamī is the chief of all dancers. (She is the leader of the dance-ensemble).

(5) **adhi**-(is) the lord. - devesu-over all the celestial beings. buddho-the Lord Buddha. **i.e.** Buddha is the Lord over all celestial beings.

Those vibhattis applied after each component words during a compounding process of nouns, are to be elided (so that it becomes a complete compound noun with one single vibhatti).

Summary: This Sutta enjoins elision of vibhatti (caseendings) and related things. Before it becomes a complete Samāsa (compound) noun, there is a combining process of two or more nouns with different vibhattis (case-endings) 
which is called a viggaha sentence (ivg[hv;Ky) abbreviated as ED. All those different vibhattis and related morphological remnant morphemes which are present during viggaha process are required to be elided by injunction of this Sutta so that it will become a completed Samāsa (compound noun) 
with one single vibhatti. Students will not fully understand the function of this Sutta unless they study the structural 

morphology of words in grammar called "Payogasiddhi or Padasiddhi". [See the appendices Section] - kathinadussaṁ, - āgantukabhattaṁ (meaning shown). Tesaṁgahaṇena samāsa, taddhitā'khyāta, kitakānaṁ vibhatti, paccaya, pada'kkharā'gamā ca lopā honti. By means of the word "tesaṁ" in Sutta, all those vibhattis, affixes, morphemes, inserted words (āgama) of Samāsa nouns, any morpheme of Taddhita nouns, Ākhyata verbs and Kita nouns, which has been component parts of the ED, can also be elided (as necessary).

- Vāsiṭṭho-Vasiṭṭha's son. - Venateyyo-Vinata's son.

Caggahaṇa'mavadhāraṇa'tthaṁ. The word "ca" in Sutta has a purpose of restricting the function of this Sutta in some examples shown below. (See that vibhatti aṁ in the preceding component word "**Pabhaṅ**" of the compound noun "**Pabhaṅkaro**" is not elided. The "ṅ" is a vagganta morpheme of **aṁ.** This kind of compound is sometimes called "**alutta** 
samāsa" where the vibhatti remains intact and is not elided as prescribed by this Sutta).

- pabhaṅ'karo-the light-maker, **i.e.** Sun. - amataṅ'dado-the giver of deathlessness, **i.e.** Buddha. - medhaṅ'karo-the wisdom-maker, or a Buddha so-named. - dīpaṅ'karo-the wisdom-light-maker, or a Buddha so-named.

When expressing trees, grass, animals, wealth, grain, town and regions collectively, a dvanda samāsa in singular number sometimes can take place for that expression and it also belongs to neuter gender.

Note: there are two examples in each. The first is of neuter gender, singular. The second, accompanied by a *nipāta* word "vā", is of plural. 

The word "vibhāsā" in Sutta is an equivalent of "vā" which signifies inconsistency of the function of the Sutta. By the word "vibhāsā", it means that there will be some dvanda compound nouns which may end in plural, not only in singular as prescribed in this Sutta.

(1) assattho ca-holy fig tree also, kapītano ca-pipal tree also,
- assatthakapītanaṁ-holy fig tree and pipal tree. [neuter, singular]
* assatthakapītanā vā [neuter, plural, the same meaning].

- kāsikosalaṁ-the Kāsi and Kosala region. * kāsikosalā vā.

Ādiggahaṇaṁ kimatthaṁ? What is the word "ādi" for? It has a purpose to show that the following examples of dvanda samāsa expressions are possible in many instances in addition to those explained above in Sutta.

(1) sāvajjañ'ca [sāvajjañ'ca=sāvajjaṁ+ca] sāvajjaṁ ca-the blameworthy thing (unwholesome) also, anavajjañ'ca [anavajjañ'ca=

(3) kaṇho ca-the black also, sukko ca-the white also,
- kaṇhasukkaṁ-the black and white. * kaṇhasukkā vā.

Note: Suttas 322, 323 show the natural characteristic of "dvanda compound" nouns in two ways, one is that every dvanda has to apply a nipāta "ca" in its ED, and the other is that they used to be of neuter gender and singular. However, as an exception, there are also some dvanda compounds in plural case.

[V] Dve padāni tulyā'dhikaraṇāni yadā samasyante, tadā so samāso **kammadhāraya**sañño hoti. When two component nouns of the related meaning and of similar case-endings are combined together, it is then called a "**kammadhāraya-appositional compound**". Summary: This Sutta defines the two chief characteristics of a "Kammadhāraya" compound noun. They are: (1) having two component words to be compounded, (2) those words must be of tulyādhikaraṇa, which means having the same base in terms of vibhatti as well as in terms of relevant meaning each word imply.

 [**tulya**-similar+**adhikaraṇa**-base or position, being in apposition to each other in terms of having the same case ending, coherent meaning and syntactic as well as syntagmatic relation]
 To clarify this fact, take a closer look at its EDs shown below. There is a "ca" after each component word which mutually pulls two words together and a sabbanāma noun "ta" shown by means of "so-that" which signifies the harmony and collateral relationship of the implied 

meaning of the two words in addition to having the same vibhattis in nominative case.

(1) mahanto ca-great also, so-that which is great, puriso cā'ti [ca+iti] puriso ca-(is) man also, iti-therefore, mahāpuriso-it is called "mahāpuriso". - mahāpuriso-the great man.

A Kammadhāraya compound noun, when preceded by the words of numerical values (**i.e.** a numerical noun), is called "**digu-numeral appositional compound**".

Summary: This Sutta simply and clearly defines the characteristic of "digu" compound by pointing to the fact that a Kammadhāraya compound when preceded by a word of the numerical value in its combination is called "digu". 

See both EDs and examples carefully to clarify this. (1) tīṇi-three, malāni-impurities. timalaṁ-three (kinds of) impurities. [the word "**mala**" is of neuter gender]
(2) tīṇi phalāni-fruits. - tiphalaṁ-three fruit. [**phala** is of neuter gender]

The two **Digu, Kammadhāraya** samāsas are called "Tappurisa".

Summary: This Sutta simply defines a combination of Digu and Kammadhāraya as a Tappurisa when it is preceded by a negative particle *nipāta* word "na" which means 
"not". See both EDs and examples carefully to clarify this.

"na" morphs into either "a" or "an" later on when it becomes a completed compound noun. (Refer to Sutta 333, 334 for changing into "a" or "an").

(1) na-not, brahmaṇo-the Brāhmin, - abrahmaṇo-non-Brāhmin.

 i.e. the bogus Brāhmin.

(2) na vasalo-a wretch, vile person. - avasalo-not a wretch, 
 **i.e.** noble.

(3) na bhikkhu-monk, - abhikkhu-non-monk, **i.e.** bogus monk.

It has the benefit of ease of reference in such Suttas as "Attaṁ nassa tappurise" etc.

Note: This Tappurisa is called Paṭhmā Tappurisa (Tappurisa in nominative case) as well as ubhe tappurisa (Tappurisa of dual nature as referred to in this Sutta) by Pāli grammarians. In the Sanskrit grammars, it is called (nñ( tpu®W) by the Sanskrit grammarians.

When those dutiyā (accusative) "aṁ vibhatti" and similar vibhattis (except nominative and vocative) are joined with the other component words together, it is then called a "**Tappurisa-Determinative compound**" Samāsa. Summary: This Sutta defines Tappurisa Samasa. When one of dutiyā, tatiyā, catutthī, pañcamī, chaṭṭhī, and sattamī vibhattis are applied after the front component nouns with its **corresponding component noun ending in** nominative case, it is then called "Tappurisa Samāsa".

In a Tappurisa compound, the front component word usually ends in one of these six vibhattis while the other compo-

nent word ends in nominative. This is a basic structural pattern of most of Tappurisa compounds. Look at the EDs of examples shown below carefully. Each vibhatti applied after the front word is clearly shown underlined in the ED of each example. If students are quite familiar with morphological patterns explained in the Nouns section, they will understand the nature of this Samāsa without much difficulty.

## [Dutiyā Tappurisa]

["ṁ" "aṁ" after the front component word, shown underlined, is indicative of the accusative case, singular]
(1) bhūmiṁ-to the earth, gato-goer, - bhūmigato-the earth-goer.

When the meaning of (an external) other word is predominant in a combination of two or more nouns, it is then called a "**Bahubbīhi-attributive** compound".

## Summary

When an **external sabbanāma noun** word, such as "**ya, ima**" etc. rather than component words included in the compound, plays a dominant role in determining the qualified collective meaning of the completed compound noun, it is then called a "**Bahubbīhi**" Samāsa compound.

To clarify this, please refer to the first example "Āgatasamaṇo" shown below. In it, the collective meaning of complete com-

pound as a whole is not the coming monks as implied by two component words "āgata and samaṇa", but the temple where the monks had arrived which is shown by the external word "ima (imaṁ)" in the ED. That external word is called "**aññapada**" and the meaning of it is known as "**aññapadattha**". This meaning is usually a predominant character of the whole Bahubbīhi compound when completed no matter how short or how long it may be. In the end of most examples shown in this grammar, the 
"**aññapadattha**" of each Bahubbīhi compound is directly indicated by the great grammarian himself. [**Añña-**other+**pada**word+**attha**-meaning. **i.e.** the meaning of other word.]
Why it is called "Bahubbīhi"? Because any compound noun in this category of compounds has the same nature of having the same implied meaning of an external, foreign word like the word "bahubbīhi". [**bahu**-much, abundant+**vīhi**-rice. Here, it does not literally mean "the abundant rice" as meant by the combination of these two words, but it only means a district where the rice is **abundant**.]
How many kinds of "**Bahubbīhi**" are there? Basically, there are altogether seven kinds of Bahubbīhi which are determined based on the vibhatti (case-ending) being applied after an "**aññapada-**(i.e. the other foreign word) such as ya, ta, eta and ima". They are: pathamā, dutiyā, tatiyā, catutthī, pañcamī, chaṭṭhī and sattamī. (7) 
Note: There are other forms of Bahubbīhi as explained by eminent Pāli grammarian **Buddha piyā'cariya**, the author of Rūpasiddhi-vyākaraṇa. However, all those forms, despite some slight differences, are also based on the case-ending of aññapada. The vibhatti-based classification is much easier to learn and remember for the beginners in the beginning process. Therefore, a student needs to carefully look out for what vibhatti case-ending is applied after an "**aññapada**" in the ED of a "**Bahubbīhi compound**". By knowing its vibhatti case-ending, they 

will be able to determine it according to its case-ending. This will not be quite difficult if a student has already studied the nouns chapter very well as all the chapters of grammar, except Sandhi and Ākhyāta, are **mostly nouns** in various forms.

For the ease of study, all the case-endings of aññapada will be shown in bold, underlined **in the ED of each compound** with the exception of its correlative word located next to it which have the same vibhatti case-ending throughout this Bahubbīhi section. This way, the students will easily notice and clearly understand its relevant category according to its vibhatti case-ending. How long a "**Bahubbīhi**" compound can be? It rather depends on how many different kinds of word are to be joined into a would-be Bahubbīhi compound until it becomes a completed Bahubbīhi. Before it becomes a Bahubbīhi, all the different words are to be first joined into relevant compounds such as Tappurisa, Kammadhāraya, Dvanda and so on. It is very interesting to study this compounding process till it becomes a complete Bahubbīhi compound. In the forthcoming pages, different Bahubbīhi compounds, some quite long, some longer and some being the longest, will be shown and explained. The students will even see some long Bahubbīhi compounds with the beautiful poetic expressions of idyllic nature coupled with the spiritual element of undying respect and pure devotion toward the Buddha, the appreciation of spiritual life of the forestdwelling ascetics, masterfully woven together by the great grammarian Mahā Kaccāyana.

as that of a masculine gender of the completed compound (when it becomes a complete word). (1) dīghā-long. jaṅghā-legs. **yassa**-of whose. so'yaṁ - dīghajaṅgho-the one who has long legs.

(2) - kalyāṇabhariyo-the one who has good wife.

(3) - pahūtapañño-the one who has much wisdom.

 [All three are Bahubbīhi].

## Explanation

In these three examples, the last component words "**jaṅghā**-calf or leg, bhariyā-wife, **paññā**-wisdom" are permanent feminine gender nouns. So, they can still assume feminine gender in the compounding process of ED. But, when the word becomes a complete word, they have become of masculine gender as the meaning of completed compound noun refers to only the man who has long leg, good wife and much wisdom.

## Bhāsitapume'Ti Kimatthaṁ?

What is the word "bhāsitapume" for? To show that the last component word "bhariyā-(wife)" in the example below is not a "bhāsitapuma-word". It is always a feminine gender. Hence, it does not need to be assumed as a masculine noun. brahmaṇabandhu ca-of the Brāhmin caste also. sā-that woman. bhariyā ca-(is) wife also. cāti * brahmaṇabandhubhariyā-the Brāhmin-caste wife. [Kammadhāraya]

[Kammadhārayasaññe+ca. 2 words]
[V] Kammadhārayasaññe ca samāse itthiyaṁ tulyā'dhikaraṇe pade pubbe bhāsitapumi'tthī ce, pumā'va daṭṭhabbā. In a Kammadhāraya compound, the first component word, which is currently a modifier adjective to the latter in feminine gender, has to be assumed as that of a masculine gender when the compound becomes a completed word.

(It means that the first word serving as a modifier adjective to the latter 

of feminine gender has to be in the same feminine gender as per the grammatical rule in the pending etymological process of compound. It is the rule of syntax that the qualifier and the qualified has to be in the same gender and of same vibhatti. But, when completed, the preceding word must re-assume its masculine gender, no longer of feminine gender which it has once been conformed to during the compounding process of ED.) 
(1) - brahmaṇadārikā-the Brāhmin girl, (2) - khattiyakaññā-the Khattiya girl, (3) - khattiyakumārikā-the Khattiya little girl.

## Explanation

In these three examples, the first component words "**brahmaṇa**-Brāhmin, khattiya-warrior" are usually of masculine genders. So, they can still assume feminine gender in the compounding process of ED by being "Brahmaṇī, Khattiyā" as per the grammatical rule. See the possible ED of the example words shown below.

(1) brahmaṇī ca sā dārikā cā'ti - brahmaṇadārikā [This is ED]
Here is the Meaning of ED:
brahmaṇī ca-(is) the Brāhmin caste also. sā-that woman. dārikā ca-is also the girl. iti-therefore - brahmaṇadārikā-the Brāhmin caste girl.

[The EDs are **not shown in the original grammatical text**. This is a sample of possible ED shown as correctly as possible. In the ED, see the word "brahmaṇī" which ends in an "ī-affix" indicating the feminine gender. This first word has to follow the feminine gender of the last word "dārikā" as it is of feminine gender].

In the meaning of completed word, the first component words re-assume their masculine gender as the meaning of completed compound noun refers to only the one whose caste or family back-ground is that of a Brāhmin or Khattiya caste system.

## Bhāsitapume'Ti Kimatthaṁ?

What is the word "bhāsitapume" for? To show that the last component word "dārikā-the young girl" in the example shown below is not a "bhāsitapuma-word". It is always of a feminine gender. Hence, it does not need to be assumed as a masculine noun.

[**bhāsita**-said before, **i.e.** being indicative of. **puma**-literally means male, **i.e.**
masculine gender].

(1) * khattiyabandhudārikā-the young girl of Khattiya caste.

(2) * brahmaṇabandhudārikā-the young girl of Brāhmin caste.

 [All examples are Kammadhāraya compounds].

What is the word "kvaci" for? To show that in some examples like the ones shown below, the function of Sutta is not applied as restricted by the word "kvaci".

* adhicittassa-the one striving for mental development. bhikkhuno-of the monk.

What does the function of "kvaci" mean? It means that when such compound nouns are used as an adjective in the wider areas of Buddhist texts based on the context, different caseendings are applied. Thus, the rule of Sutta is only a statement of the general pattern of such nouns.

Note: Though it is said in Sutta as only a-ending Abyayībhāva is applicable, it should be noted that ā-ending abyayībhāva compound is also applicable by the function of this Sutta after "ā" is shortened by the next Sutta 342. See ā-ending abyayībhāva example "upagaṅgaṁ" shown in the next Sutta to clarify this fact.

[adhi+itthī] - **adhi**kumāri. [Adhi+kumārī] - upavadhu. [Upa+vadhū] (Refer to previous Sutta for the meaning) 
Explanation: The vibhatti applied after a-ending abyayībhāva is not elided as it undergoes morphological procedure of changing into "aṁ" by Sutta 341. Also, in ā-ending abyayībhāva compounds, ā is shortened by the preceding Sutta and then undergoes similar procedure by Sutta 341. In **ī, ū-**ending abyayībhāva compounds, the vibhattis applied after them are to be elided as they do not need to undergo any further morphological function. Compare similar functions enjoined for those plain, non-compound nouns ending in "ī, ū" by Suttas 118, 220 in the nouns chapter.

To signify "the son or descendant of someone", an affix "ṇa" is sometimes added after that noun denoting it.

[The affix "ṇa" is invisible in the examples]
Note: There are **three types of endings** in each example:
ending in "o, aṁ, and ī". The "o" and "aṁ", are vibhattiderivative morphemes of masculine and neuter genders respectively while "ī" is an affix for the feminine gender. The 
"o" is morpheme of nominative singular "si" for any nouns of masculine gender while "aṁ" is derivative morpheme of "si" for nouns of neuter gender. The "ī" represents nouns belonging to feminine gender which has no morpheme as 

applied "si" is elided. Such type of word-endings will be found not only in Taddhita, but also in Samāsa, Kita and Uṇādi chapters as those words are also nouns in different genders. To highlight this, the word "si" is included in the WA of each Taddhita nouns. The word analysis [WA] is shown only where necessary. WA for most examples is quite easy to study in Taddhita. In WA, there will be slight changes of vowels between the example and word analysis. For example, it will be **ā, e** or o though it is shown as **a, i,** or u in the word analysis of example word. This is due to the **Vuddhi** procedure occurred in the example as a result of having an ṇ-conjoined affix. [Refer to Sutta 400, 404] (1) (a) vasiṭṭhassa-of a person named Vasiṭṭha. apaccaṁ-son or male descendant. vāsiṭṭho-Vasiṭṭha's son or descendant.

## Explanation

This stanza shows that there can never be an absolute rule regarding the rules of morphological procedures as prescribed in the Suttas. Sometimes, in some instances, that rule is not applied. Thus leaving room for any exception for variable outcome of the words as the pattern of common spoken language may prevail sometimes despite the prescribed grammatical rules. In the examples of words cited, all the three words have an ṇ-joined-ṇa affix applied as per this Sutta. With an **ṇ-joined-affix** being present in the words, both "ī" of **Nīla**-blue-dyed cloth and **Pīta**-yellow-dyed cloth, also the vowel "u" of Phusso, should have seen a vuddhi process occurred. Thus possibly affecting to change into other word-forms such as **Nela, Peta** and **Phossa**. But it never had occurred as common usage pattern of the language is only **Nīla, Pīta** and Phussa. Similarly, if an additional consonant "s" is to be attached to the aṁvibhatti-ending word "**siro**-head", then it should have become "**sirasaṁ**" 
instead. But it remained unchanged though. Therefore, sometimes there may be some exceptions to any prescribed grammatical rule as and when dictated by the prevalent common norms and patterns of the language in the society. This is what the stanza means.

(Nouns in affix expressive of the abstract condition) 
Note: Suttas 360, 361, 362 apply affixes to form abstract nouns expressive of condition or state or a qualitative character of someone or something. The affixes are similar to English affixes such as "hood, **ship**" from the words "boyhood, lordship" etc.

For example, **tara** is positive while **tama** is superlative. Similarly, isika

All the applied "yo" vibhattis after them also change into "**īsaṁ,** āsaṁ, ṭhi, ri, ti, īti, uti" respectively.

## Explanation

(on the morphological procedure as prescribed in the Sutta) 
When a **dasa** (a numerical value in ten) is multiplied by times in a Dvanda: dvika (two), **tika** (three), **catukka** (four), **pañcaka** (five), **chakka** (six), sattaka (seven), **aṭṭhaka** (eight), **navaka** (nine), all the resultant times of the same **dasa** in the dvanda compound process has to be made into "**ekasesa**", 
thereby having only one "**dasa**" left, but the resultant numerical value of each multiplication is to remain accordingly unchanged. Afterwards, it will look like this:
(1) **dasa** [multiplied x in two times=twenty]
(2) **dasa** [multiplied x in three times=thirty] (3) **dasa** [multiplied x in four times=forty]

(4) **dasa** [multiplied x in five times=fifty] (5) **dasa** [multiplied x in six times=sixty] (6) **dasa** [multiplied x in seven times=seventy] (7) **dasa** [multiplied x in eight times=eighty] (8) **dasa** [multiplied x in nine times=ninety]
Now, next stage **of morphological procedure is like this:**
Here, paṭhamā "yo" vibhatti (nominative plural) is to be applied after each dasa. So, there will be a "yo" after each of eight "dasa".

Example: (1) dasa+yo.....(8) dasa+yo By injunction of this Sutta, each of eight "**dasa**" are to be respectively changed into **vī, ti, cattāra, paññā, cha, satta, asa,** 
nava respectively. Then it will look like this: (1) **vī+yo**, (2) **ti+yo**, (3) **cattāra+yo**, (4) **paññā+yo**, (5) **cha+yo**, (6) (a) **satta+yo**, (b) **satta+yo**, (7) **asa+yo**, (8) **nava+yo**. Then, all the applied "yo" after each of eight "**dasa**" are to be changed into **īsaṁ** (for three initial words), āsaṁ, ṭhi, ri, ti, īti, **uti** 
respectively. Now, here is what it will look like: (when all preceding morphological procedures are done) 
(1) **vī+īsaṁ** (elide ī after v and then, join v to ī) **vīsaṁ**=20 (2) **ti+īsaṁ** ("i" of "ti" is elided. A niggahita ṁ has to be inserted after ti, 
"ī" is shortened) **tiṁsaṁ**=30
(3) **cattāra+īsaṁ** (elide a behind r and change "r" into "l" by 379, join l to ī) **cattālīsaṁ**=40 ["**īsam**" function for examples 1,2,3]
(4) **paññā+āsaṁ** (elide ā after ñ and join ñ to next **ā) paññāsaṁ**=50 (5) **cha+ṭhi** (change "cha" into "sa". Reduplicate with one ṭ) **saṭṭhi**=60 (6) (a) **satta+ri**=(no further action needed) **sattari**=70 (b) **satta+ti**=(no further action needed) **sattati**=70
[2 examples for the 70]
(7) **asa+īti**=(delete a after s and join s to next ī) **asīti**=80 (8) **nava+uti**=(elide a after v and then join v to next u) **navuti**=90 Now, let's see the examples of Sutta as finished words:
- vīsaṁ-Twenty. - tiṁsaṁ-Thirty. - cattālīsaṁ-Forty.

- paññāsaṁ-Fifty. - saṭṭhi-Sixty. - sattari-Seventy. - sattatiSeventy. - asīti-Eighty. - navuti-Ninety.

 [All these words are Dvanda compound nouns]
Asakin'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "asakiṁ" for? To show that the example below is meant for only one time, not "asakim-many times". So, it is inapplicable.

[This word "**asakiṁ**" is to be found in the vutti of Sutta]
* dasa-ten. Gaṇane'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "gaṇane" for? To show that the example below is meant for the statement of a fact, not for numerical counting. So, it is inapplicable. * dasadasakā-ten multiplied by ten. purisā-men (a hundred men).

- paccakkhadhammā-the one who have witnessed (realized) 
 Dhamma. [Here, component vowel "a" of the last word "ma" becomes "ā". Note: This function is also redundant as "yo" applied after it can be changed into "ā" by normal procedure as prescribed in the previous sections of noun and Samāsa. [ādi-in the beginning. **majje**-in the middle, uttara-at the last point]
icce'va'mādi.

- bhikkhu-male-monk. - bhikkhunī-female-monk. [In these examples, "si" vibhatti applied after them is elided. As this procedure was also shown in the Nouns section, it is a redundant function]
icce'va'mādi.

## Āgama Procedure

Appearance of non-existent syllable by procedure of āgama-'coming', this insertion process is called "āgama".

Ādi-āgamo tāva– First, (here are examples where) "**āgama-**coming 
& inserting of new alphabet" process takes place in the beginning:

## Vikāra Procedure

The transformation of a visible syllable into other different form of syllable is called "Vikāra".

Ādivikāro tāva– First, (here are examples where) "**vikāra-**changing into different forms" process takes place in the beginning:
- ārisyaṁ [Here, "i" changed into "ā" and "ri" is inserted after it]. - āṇyaṁ [Here, "i" changed into "ā"]. - āsabhaṁ [Here, "u" changed into "ā"]. - ajjavaṁ [Here, "u" changed into "ā" and shortened]

Viparīta Procedure Changing of a visible syllable such as "o or ava" into "u" and vice versa is called "viparīta".

Ādiviparīto tāva–First, (here are examples where) "**viparītareversal**" process takes place in the beginning:
- uggate-when arisen. sūriye-the sun. **i.e.** When the sun arises. - uggacchati-(it) rises up.

[In both examples, the initial vowel "ava" transforms into "u"] .

icce'va'mādi. Majjhe viparīto tāva– First, (here are examples where) "**viparīta**"
process takes place in the middle:
- sa'muggacchati [saṁ+uggacchati], saṁuggacchati-(it) rises up well.

- sa'muggate [saṁ+uggate] saṁuggate-when well-arisen. sūriye-the sun i.e. when the sun is well-arisen.

[In both examples, the middle vowel "u" between "m" and "**g",** which is shown underlined, is a reversed morpheme of "**ava".** This function was already shown in Sutta 79, the Nouns chapter].

icce'va'mādi.

Uttaraviparīto tāva– First, (here are examples where) "**viparīta**"
process takes place at the end:

- yūnaṁ-of "i" and "u" Note: The word "**yūnaṁ**" is to be initially based as: "iu". Then, by this Sutta, "i" transforms into "y">yu. Then, apply a genitive plural "naṁ" after it>**yu+naṁ.** After "u" is lengthened by Sutta 89, it eventually becomes a complete word "**yūnaṁ**".

icce'va'mādi.

Majjhe-ādeso tāva– First, (here are examples where) "**ādesa**" process takes place in the middle:
- nyāyogo-being always involved, constant effort. [Here, the original word is "ni+āyogo". "i" transforms into "y" by means of this Sutta and later it becomes a completed word. The example shown in Sutta 51].

- cittaṁ-the amazing, the mind. [Here, "si" vibhatti applied after the word transforms into "aṁ" by this Sutta. The function of all three examples have been already shown in the Nouns section. The word "Citta" originally means wonderful, amazing].

icce'va'mādi. Evaṁ yathājinavacanā'nuparodhena sabbattha yojetabbā.

Thus, appropriate procedures should be applied in all examples by not contravening Buddha's words.

Note: Some functions, although shown previously, are included in this Sutta again in order to show that all those various kinds of morphological procedures and functions can also be performed by means of invoking the injunction of this great Sutta.

(1) a-is to be known as akāra (a-letter). (2) i and ī are to be known as **ivaṇṇa**. (3) u and ū are to be known as **uvaṇṇa.**
Changing into "ā, e, **o,"** of all these a, i-ī, u-ū, vowels respectively, are formally called the process of "**vuddhi**".

ā, ī, and ū vowels are also called the natural vuddhi.

Note: As shown in translation, the vowel "a" changes into "ā". "i or ī" changes into "e". "u or ū" changes into "o". This is what is formally called "vuddhi". 

By the last sentence "**ā, ī, ū-**vuddhi ca", it explains that "ā", "ī" and "ū" are also termed natural vuddhi (*pakati vuddhi*).

This Sutta clearly defines the process of "vuddhi" in a very simple explanation.

The last sentence is not found in the Devanāgarī edition of Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa edited by (l=mIn;r;y, itv;rI and bIrbl xmR;).

 **Summary:** There are **eight group** of Ākhyāta Vibhattis for all Pāli verbs known as Ākhyāta. Each Vibhatti comprises twelve. This Sutta **names the first pair of six** which are out of **that twelve, as the "Parassapada"** group. Here in this section, a **Vibhatti is a form of verb-endings** 
or verb-terminations to be applied after the roots in order to form a Verb. **In the nouns section, a Vibhatti is a** 

case-ending to be applied after the nouns. Note this distinctive role of two types of Vibhattis carefully.

Taṁ yathā? For example. Ti-anti, si-tha, mi-ma. They are "Ti-anti, si-tha, mi-ma". **(6)** Parassapada'micca'nena kvattho? Kattari parassapadaṁ. What is the benefit by terming "parassapada"? It has the benefit of making easy reference in such Suttas as "Kattari parassapadaṁ" etc.

Taṁ yathā? For example, Te ante, se vhe, e mhe. They are "Te ante, se vhe, e mhe". **(6)** Attanopada'micca'nena kvattho? Attanopadāni bhāve ca kammani. What is the benefit by terming "attanopada"? It has the benefit of making easy reference in such Suttas as "Attanopadāni bhāve ca kammani" etc.

Summary: This Sutta names other six pairs as "**attanopada**". By both Suttas 406-407, the Ākhyāta verbs are divided into **two main groups**. Viz.

(1) **Parassapada** verbs and (2) **Attanopada** verbs.

The purpose is to make a clear distinction between the two groups in 

terms of voice and the way they are used in a sentence. The voice of each vibhatti **groups will be explained in Sutta No. 453 and 456.**

Of all the eight vibhattis which have been grouped into six parassapada and six attanopada, a pair of two in each of those two groups, are called **paṭhama purisa, majjhima** purisa and uttama purisa respectively. Taṁ yathā? For example:
Among the first six parassapada vibhattis:
Ti, anti, iti **paṭhama**purisā. (The first pair) 
ti and **anti** are called **paṭhama**purisa (The first person, **i.e.** third person).

si, tha, iti **majjhima**purisā. (The second pair) 
si and **tha** are called **majjhima**purisa (The middle person. **i.e.** Second person).

mi, ma, iti **uttama**purisā. (The third pair) 
mi and ma are called **uttama**purisa (The * high person. **i.e.** First person).

Note: * It is translated as the high person as the word "uttama" implies.

Attanopadānam'pi.

Of (the next six) attanopada vibhattis:
te, ante, iti **paṭhama**purisā.

te and **ante** are called **paṭhama**purisa (The first person).

se, vhe, iti **majjhima**purisā.

se and **vhe** are called **majjhima**purisa (The middle person).

e, mhe, iti **uttama**purisā.

e and **mhe** are called **uttama**purisa (The high person).

Evaṁ-(It should be noted) thus. sabbattha-in all eight vibhattis.

What is the benefit by terming "Paṭhama, majjhima, uttama-purisa"?

It has the benefit of making easy reference in such Suttas as "Nāmamhi payujjamānepi tulyādhikaraṇe paṭhamo, Tumhe majjhimo, Amhe uttamo" etc.

Note: This Sutta clearly sets out a pair of two in each vibhatti group to three persons (purisas) assigning each pair to their respective purisas. Please note it carefully because the assigned pairs of vibhattis are to be conjugated with their respective verbs and persons accordingly. Only when one correctly knows with what vibhatti and purisa (person) are to be used together, one will then be able to write and understand Pāli easily.

## 409, 441. SˆB Es M Ekþaibdan E Pro Puirso 409, 441. Sabbesa'Mekā'Bhidhāne Paro Puriso.

[Sabbesaṁ+eka-abhidhāne+paro+puriso. 4 words]
[V] Sabbesaṁ tiṇṇaṁ paṭhama,majjhimu'ttama-purisānaṁ ekā'bhidhāne paro puriso gahetabbo. When all two or three purisas (as possible subjects) specify the same action in a sentence, the last one is to determine the purisa of the sentence.

 It means that only relevant vibhatti and number that conforms to the last purisa (person, **i.e.** subject) shall be used in the verb when multiple subjects are involved in the same action (**i.e.** verb). Look at example sentences (a) and (b) shown below carefully. In (a), two different persons with their relevant verbs. In (b), only the last person's plural termination "tha" is applied thus combining both. Purisa and vibhattis are shown in bold-faced letters.

[a] so-that person. ca-also. paṭhati-recites. tvañ'ca [tvañ'ca=tvaṁ+ca]-you also. paṭhasi-recites.

Here two purisas are concurrently shown for the same action of a verb. 

See that the second person singular "tvaṁ" is the last purisa. This will determine as the purisa to be used in a sentence of combined purisas. 

See the final sentence here:

[b] **tumhe-**you (both that person and you). paṭha**tha-**recite.

(Two purisa, **i.e.** persons are combined into one second person plural in this last sentence. Only the last purisa, second person, plural number is used in the verb. It is to be assumed that the first purisa 
"so" is included in the second person plural form "tumhe-you both".

This example shows how the last purisa, **i.e.** person, is to determine the verb of combined purisa. Next example is the same except the action of verb).

[a] so ca pacati-cooks. **tvañ**'ca [tvañ'ca=tvaṁ+ca] pacasi. [b] tumhe-you (both that person and you). paca**tha-**cook. Evaṁ sesāsu vibhattīsu paro puriso yojetabbo. In this way, in the remaining vibhattis, the last person should be applied.

## The Three Persons

Note: The following three Sutta Nos. 410, 411 and 412 will explain three persons, called **"purisa"**, which are used in Pāli grammar. Note them carefully as it is one of very important fundamental aspects of the grammar.

410, 432. nAmVýh pyuÀjmAn eip tu£yAiDkþrf e pXmo 410, 432. Nāmamhi payujjamāne'pi tulyā'dhikaraṇe paṭhamo.

5 words]
[V] Nāmamhi payujjamāne'pi appayujjamāne'pi tulyādhikaraṇe paṭhamapuriso hoti.

When a noun [as a subject] is either directly present or implicit in a sentence which is of a tulyādhikaraṇa (being appositional) nature, it is called **paṭhamapurisa** (the first person). [**paṭhama=**first+**purisa=**person]
(1) [Singular subject & verb] so-that person, or he. gacchati-goes. (2) [Plural subject & verb] te-those persons, or they. gacch**anti-**go.

 (In these two sentences, both subject and verb are present.) 
Appayujjamāne'pi–example where subject is implicit (not directly shown):
(1) [Singular verb only] gacchati-(he) goes.

(2) [Plural verb only] gacch**anti**-(they) go. (In these two sentences, only the verb is shown. The subject is not shown) 
Tulyādhikaraṇe'ti ki'matthaṁ? What is the word "tulyādhikaraṇe" for? To show that in the example shown below, there is no "tulyādhikaraṇa". So, it is inapplicable.

tena-by that. haññase-(are) killed. tvaṁ-you. devadattenaDevadatta. **i.e.** You are killed by that Devadatta (passive voice, in the 2nd person).

Note: Tulyā'dhikaraṇe-means of being in the same position. The relationship of the subject and verb has to be directly related to each other in terms of meaning as well as in direct syntactic relation of voice.

Here, subject, the killer "tena Devadattena" has no direct syntactic relationship, but the killed "tvaṁ" only has direct link to the verb as the main principal object of passive voice verb. Hence, no tulyādhikaraṇa. As a result, the first person verb termination ti or **anti** is inapplicable in this sentence.

[V] Tumhe payujjamāne'pi appayujjamāne'pi tulyādhikaraṇe majjhimapuriso hoti.

When a **tumha** (you) pronoun [as a subject] is either directly present or implicit in a sentence of tulyādhikaraṇa, it is called **majjhimapurisa** (The middle person, **i.e.** the second person). [**majjhima=**middle+**purisa=**person] (1) [Singular subject & verb] tvaṁ-you (singular). yā**si-go.** (2) [Plural subject & verb] tumhe-you (plural). yā**tha-go.** Appayujjamāne'pi–example where subject is implicit (not directly shown):
(1) [Singular verb only] yāsi-(you) go, (2) [Plural verb only] yātha-(you-plural) go.

Tulyādhikaraṇe'ti ki'matthaṁ?

What is the word "tulyādhikaraṇe" for? To show that in the 

example shown below, there is no "tulyādhikaraṇa". So, it is inapplicable. tayā-by you. paccate-(is) cooked. odano-the rice.

i.e. the rice is cooked by you.

412, 437. **Amhe uttamo.** [Amhe+uttamo. 2 words]
[V] Amhe payujjamāne'pi appayujjamāne'pi tulyā'dhikaraṇe uttamapuriso hoti.

When an **amha** (me) pronoun [as a subject] is either directly present or implicit in a sentence of tulyādhikaraṇa nature, it is called **uttamapurisa** (the high person, "**Uttama**" means noble or high or the last.)
Note: Terming persons is a bit different from the English grammar. 

Here **in Pāli grammar, the third person is the first. The last person** 
is the first in English grammar. Despite such minor differences, the role of each person remain the same in terms of actual usage in each language. [**uttama=**high, noble, last+**purisa=**person]
(1) [Singular subject & verb] ahaṁ-I. yajāmi-worship. (2) [Plural subject & verb] mayaṁ-we. yajāma-worship. Appayujjamāne'pi–example where subject is implicit (not directly shown) :
(1) [Singular verb only] yajāmi-(I) worship. (2) [Plural verb only] yajāma-(We) worship. Tulyādhikaraṇe'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "tulyādhikaraṇe" for? To show that in the example shown below, there is no "tulyādhikaraṇa". mayā-by me. ijjate-(is) worshipped. buddho-Buddha.

# Ākhyāta Vibhatti Tables

The Verb-termination and three persons How they are to be conjugated and used according to their relevant Purisa 
(persons) and Numbers.

Please carefully study the two tables shown alongside in next pages to clearly understand as to (a) how each purisa (person) is related to an individual Ākhyāta vibhatti (Verb-terminations) and how they are to be used together accordingly and (b) what are the relevant three persons among various kinds of Pāli nouns. Once the students clearly understand all the necessary basics for the correct conjugation, only then they will be able to correctly conjugate and use three purisas with their respective relevant vibhatti (verb-terminations) together in a sentence. Note that those two vibhattis shown with this *mark are not widely and frequently used in the scriptures.

## The Formative System Of Pāli Verbs

"The Roots and Ākhyāta Verb-terminations" How to conjugate them together to form a Pāli verb.

## The Roots

The students should understand the important role of the roots as they are the bases of the verbs on which verbs are built. There are three kinds of roots. They are: (a) single stem or one-syllable roots such as:
vā-to move, yā-to go, pā-to drink, ji-to conquer, nī-to carry, su-to flow, **bhū-**to be, etc.

(b) dual-word roots such as: **gamu-**to go, **paca-**to cook, **vada-**to speak etc.

(c) multiple-stem or three syllable roots such as **vāyama-**to attempt, **araha-**to deserve, **kilisa-**to torment, etc.

Note: Only the roots with a maximum of three syllables are found to be in use in the scriptural texts.

The Vibhattis
(The Verb-terminations) 
Before studying conjugation, it is necessary to understand various nature of vibhattis. There are three kinds of vibhattis based on their initials. They are: (a) **consonant-initial** vibhatti such as ti, se, tu, ssati, ssā etc. (b) **vowel-initial** vibhatti such as **anti, ante**, aṁ, **āmase** etc. (c) **complete-vowel** vibhatti such as e, a, ā, ī, u, ū, etc. Method: For consonant-initial vibhattis, just put the root before the vibhatti. It is quite easy. For the vowel-initial or complete vowels roots, delete the last component vowel of the root and only the last vowel-less consonant of the root should be attached to the vibhatti by placing it before a vibhatti.

## 595 The Form Of Verbs

There are three factors which play an integral part in shaping the form of a verb. They are: (a) the vibhatti, (b) the component vowel of the root, (c) the affix which is applied after the root.

## Explanation

It is quite easy to understand a verb by looking at the applied vibhatti (verb-termination) if the student knows all the eight groups of Ākhyāta-vibhattis thoroughly well.

## Component Vowels Of The Root

(a) For the roots comprising only an "a" such as **paca-**to cook, vasa-to dwell, and **vada-**to speak, there is not much difference in the shape of verbs as it has only one "a" in it. Therefore, it is quite easy and simple to form a verb using those roots.

(b) For the single-syllable roots with an "ā", it may retain its natural vowel sometimes. But that "ā" may sometimes change into an "āya" in most instances of verbs.

(c) For the single-syllable roots with an "e", it may keep its natural vowel sometimes. But that "e" may change into an 
"āya" in some instances of verbs.

(d) For the roots comprising either of "i, ī, u, ū" vowels in a root, regardless of being a single or a dual or a multiple syllable root, there used to be a slight change in the form of the verb. This happens due to a morphological process known as "**vuddhi**" and its follow-up procedure. According to this procedure, "i, ī" used to be changed into an "e". In some cases, "e" changes into an "aya" and even that "aya" further changes into an "āya" in some instances of verbs. For the roots containing "**u or** ū", it may change into an "o". In some cases, it may further change into an "ava". In some cases, it may still continue to change into an "āva".

## 596 Examples: (1) The Single-Stem Root With "Ā"

Vā-to blow, to move. Here "ā" does not undergo any change thus retaining its natural vowel. e.g., **Vāti** (The wind blows). When this "ā" further changes into "āya", a new verb form emerges. e.g., **Vāyati** (The wind blows).

## (2) The Single-Stem Root With "I"

Ji-to win, to conquer. Here " i" changes into "e", e.g. **Jeti** (he wins). When this "e" further changes into "aya", a new verb form emerges, e.g., **Jayati** (he wins).

(3) The single-stem root with "ī" Nī-to carry. Here "ī" changes into "e", e.g. **Neti** (he carries). When this "e" further changes into "aya", a new verb form emerges as **Nayati** (he carries).

(4) The single-stem root with "u" Su-to flow. Here "u" changes into "o". This "o" further changes into "ava" resulting in a new verb form as **Savati** (the river) flows. Hu-to sacrifice. Here "u" changes into "o". This "o" further changes into "ava" resulting in a new verb form as **Havati** (He) sacrifices.

(5) The single-stem root with "ū" Hū-to be. Here "ū" changes into "o", e.g. **Hoti** (it is). Bhū-to be. Here "ū" changes into "o". This "o" further changes into "ava", resulting in a new verb form as **Bhavati**
(It is).

(6) The single-syllable **root with "e**"
For the single-syllable roots with an "e", it usually changes into an "āya" in most instances. Example: Ge-to sing, e.g. **Gāyati** (He) sings. Jhe-to burn, to contemplate. e.g. **Jhāyati** (The fire) burns or (he) 
contemplates.

# The Affix And Its Impact On The Verb Forms

When an affix such as a **Kārita (causative affix) or other affix** is applied after the root in a verb, it can usually affect the vuddhi process and some subsequent follow-up morphological procedures occur. Examples:
Lū-to cut, Base structure: lū+ṇe+ti (with causative affix ṇe & ti. "ṇ" is deleted leaving only "e">lū+e+ti) 
Here "ū" changes into "o" as a "vuddhi" procedure. This "o" further changes into an "āva"> lāv+e+ti, resulting in a new verb form as **Lāveti** (It causes to cut). Nī-to carry. **Base structure:** nī+ṇe+ti Here "ī" changes into "e" as a "vuddhi" procedure. This "e" further changes into an "āya", resulting in a new verb form as Nāyeti (It causes to carry).

## The Conjugation Of Dual-Syllable Roots

Of the three roots mentioned above, conjugation of the dualsyllable roots is quite simple and easy for beginners to understand. Study the following example of the root "**gamu**-to go".

Note that the last component vowel "u" is to be elided as per Sutta No. 521 thus having the root-form as "gam" and consonant "m" of the root changes into "cch" as per Sutta 476. So, the steps of change for this root is=**gamu**>gam>gacch. See below. Example: **gamu>gam>gacch**-to go (a) Now, let's attach this root to consonant-initial vibhattis "**ti, si** 
and **tha".** It is quite easy as there is nothing complex to do except to conjugate everything together. Gacch+a+ti= Gacchati (He) goes. Gacch+a+si=Gacchasi (You) go. Gacch+a+tha=Gacchatha (You, plural) go.

Note: An affix "a" is applied as per Sutta 445. When conjugating with vibhattis like **mi, ma** and **mhe,** follow the rule 

prescribed in Sutta No.478. The rule stipulates that the front vowel in front of **mi, ma** and mhe must be lengthened. So, it will look like "Gacchā". Now, let's attach this morphed root-structure to "mi" "ma" and "mhe". Gacchā+mi= Gacchāmi. (I) go. Gacchā+ma= Gacchāma. (we) go. Gacchā+mhe= Gacchāmhe. (we) go.

(b) Let's attach this "gacch" to vowel-initial vibhattis "**anti, ante, aṁ** and **āmase".** Don't forget to remove the affix vowel 
"a" because one consonant can be combined to one vowels only, not to two vowels. So, we have to delete it before combining. Look at examples below carefully. Gacch+anti=Gacchanti (They) go. Gacch+ante=Gacchante (They) go. Gacch+aṁ=Gacchaṁ (I) went. Gacch+āmase=Gacchāmase (We must) go.

(c) Now, again, let's attach this same thing to complete-vowel vibhattis "**e, a, ā, ī, u** and ū". Remember that the same rule of removing the last component vowel applies. Also keep in mind that as per the rule set forth in Sutta No. 519, there should be an "a" in the front of verbs applied with **ā, ī, ū,** vibhattis. There can also be verbs without "a" as the rule is optional, not a consistent injunction. So, there will be two example of the verbs. Gacch+e=Gacche, (I) go. Gacch+a=Gaccha, (he) have gone. Gacch+ā=Agacchā, gacchā, (he) has gone. Gacch+ī=Agacchī, gacchī, (he) had gone. Gacch+ī=Agacchi, gacchi, (he) had gone. (When "ī" is shortened as "i") 
Gacch+u=Gacchu, (they) have gone. Gacch+ū=Agacchū, gacchū, (They) have gone.

# Sample Combination Of The Roots With Ākhyāta Vibhattis

The following is a completely detailed form of various verbs conjugated with all eight Ākhyāta vibhattis. The sample verbs of each Vibhatti will be shown here so that the students will be able to try conjugating other roots with all of the eight vibhattis easily. All the vibhattis, except Parokkhā, Hiyyattanī and Ajjattanī, are quite easy to conjugate with any root. However, it may be a challenge for the student to conjugate verbs using Parokkhā, Hiyyattanī and Ajjattanī vibhattis. But, with determination and practice, the student will find it a bit easy later on. Please note that the Verbs shown with this *mark are **irregular-verbs**
different from their original vibhatti forms. Please see the explanations carefully so that students will not be confused with the irregular verb forms. It is recommended that any serious student who wants to learn and master the Pāli efficiently should study these sample verb-forms repeatedly until they become quite familiar with all verb forms.

Note: The verb-forms shown below are **plain verbs in the active voice** 
mode which are easier for the beginners. For the **Passive voice verb forms** and causative **verb forms,** only a few samples will be shown. All detailed treatment of this subject are dealt with in a separate book.

## The Plain Verbs (Active Voice) Vattamānā Vibhatti

(Present Indicative) 
Root: gamu-to go. The "m" of the root changes into "**ccha**" (Re Sutta 476).

[Parassapada]
(ti) Gacchati, *Gacche. **(anti)** Gacchanti, *Gacchare. ("anti" changes into "re" sometimes) (si) Gacchasi. **(tha)** Gacchatha.

(mi) Gacchāmi, *Gacche. ("ti, mi" sometimes changes into "e") (ma) Gacchāma.

[Attanopada]
(te) Gacchate. **(ante)** Gacchante, *Gacchare. ("ante" sometimes change into "re") 
(se) Gacchase. (**vhe)** Gacchavhe. (e) Gacche. **(mhe)** Gacchāmhe.

Note: Please note carefully that there is a dīgha "ā" in "mi, ma and mhe" vibhatti verbs, as per injunction of Sutta No. 478.

## Pañcamī Vibhatti (Imperative)

[Parassapada]
(tu) Gacchatu, *Gacche. **(antu)** Gacchantu. (hi) Gacchāhi, *Gaccha ("hi" elided), *Gacchassu. (tha) Gacchatha. (mi) Gacchāmi, *Gacche ("tu, mi" sometimes changes into "e"). (ma) Gacchāma.

## [Attanopada]

(taṁ) Gacchataṁ. **(antaṁ)** Gacchantaṁ. (ssu) Gacchassu. (**vho)** Gacchavho. (e) Gacche. **(āmase)** Gacchāmase.

Note: Please note carefully that there are three examples in "hi-vibhatti", one without "hi" (Re: Sutta 479), the other with a "hi" and another with "ssu" function (Re: Sutta 571). Also note a dīgha in "mi, ma-vibhatti" verbs.

## Sattamī Vibhatti (Optative) [Parassapada]

(eyya) Gaccheyya, *Gacche. **(eyyuṁ)** Gaccheyyuṁ. (eyyāsi) Gaccheyyāsi, *Gacche. **(eyyātha)** Gaccheyyātha. (eyyāmi) Gaccheyyāmi, *Gacche. **(eyyāma)** Gaccheyyāma.

(eyyāmhe) Gaccheyyāmhe.

Note: Note the irregular verb form "e" in "**eyya, eyyāsi, eyyāmi, eyyaṁ**" vibhattis as these sometimes changes into "e" in the canonical Pāli texts.

Parokkhā Vibhatti (Past Perfect) 
[Parassapada]
(a) Jagama, jagāma. **(u)** Jagamu. (e) Jagame. **(ttha)** Jagamittha. (aṁ) Jagamaṁ. **(amha)** Jagamimha.

Note: In this Vibhatti group, there is some reduplication of the initial word of root as per Sutta 458. See "ja" as the effect of this function. Also, in the Parokkhā, Ajjatanī, Bhavissanti, Kālātipatti vibhattis, there is an "i" behind the root of some verbs as per Sutta No. 516. To clarify this, see the verbs in ttha, re, ttho, vho, mhe vibhattis where an "i" is shown in bold. [See Sutta 467 "Kavaggassa cavaggo", Rūpasiddhi Pāli grammar text].

## Hiyyattanī Vibhatti (Imperfect) [Parassapada]

(ā) Agacchā-Gacchā, *Agaccha-Gaccha ("ā" shortened). (ū) Agacchū-Gacchū, *Agacchu-Gacchu ("ū" shortened). (o) Agaccho-Gaccho, *Agaccha-Gaccha, *Agacchi-Gacchi. (ttha) Agacchattha-Gacchattha, *Agacchatha-Gacchatha. (aṁ) Agacchaṁ-Gacchaṁ. (mhā) Agacchamhā-Gacchamhā.

Note: Please carefully note that there are two types of verbs in each vibhatti, one with an "a" in front and the other without it. It is as per the rule set forth in Sutta No. 519, but is not a consistent pattern. Also note carefully that in 
"o-vibhatti" verb, there are extra two pairs of verbs: Agaccha-Gaccha, Agacchi-Gacchi which is seen frequently in the Pāli texts. The vibhatti "o" changes into "a" or "i" sometimes. It is quite rare to see verbs in the original structure of "o" vibhatti **in the scriptures.** Instead, it is seen in changed state of "a" **or "i**". Regarding this, there is a grammatical rule in Moggalāṇa Vyākaraṇa which specifically stipulated that the "o" changes into either "a" or "i" or "ttha" or "**ttho**" by a procedure of Sutta named "**Ossa a, i, ttha,** 
ttho". Also in Rūpasiddhi, a very well-known, highly respected grammar, it is said: "**Kvacidhātū'ti ādina okarassa a-ādeso vā**". It means that by applying the function of "Kvaci dhātu" Sutta (No. 517), "o-vibhatti" changes into an "a" in some instances. Although two pairs of extra examples are shown, all the examples can be found in the scriptures.

# The Plain Verbs (Passive Voice) Vattamānā Vibhatti

To build passive voice verb-forms, students should understand two mainly important things. They are: (1) The passive voice verb forms are mainly Kamma-specific in nature. As such, they have to be in Kamma-specific vibhattis. This means that no other vibhattis, except Kamma-specific **six** Attanopada-vibhattis only can be used in the passive voice.

(2) Next, those verbs are to be affixed with Kamma-specific affixes only. This means that no other affixes can be used in the passive voice structure.

## The Kamma-Specific Vibhatti And Affixes

Out of twelve Verb-terminations in each of eight Ākhyāta vibhattis, **only six Attanopada have Kamma** (passive) and Bhāva (impersonal) **voices**. (Refer to Sutta 453). However, they may be Kattu-specific sometimes. (See Sutta 454). As for Kamma-specific affixes, only one "ya" affix applied by Sutta 440 is eligible to be used in the passive voice structure of Ākhyāta verbs. This basic rule is quite easy to understand and apply in the sentence structure. Therefore, Pāli is quite simple to learn.

## The Practical Method

Method: (1) Begin with six attanopada Vattamānā Vibhattis. (2) Use only "ya" affix.

Please note that **the verbs affixed with "ya" have some distinctive forms** which may be a bit challenging for the beginners. Therefore, only more simple **structure** and easy to build verbform **will be shown** here.

The formula of passive voice form is: (Try to remember) Root+i or ī +ya+relevant attanopada vibhatti. (4 parts) Now, let's start building verbs in the passive voice: Root: Paca=to cook. Affix: ya Attanopada-termination Kamma-specific
(te) Pacīyate. **(ante)** Pacīyante, *Pacīyare. (se) Pacīyase. **(vhe)** Pacīyavhe. **(e)** Pacīye. **(mhe)** Pacīyāmhe.

## Parassapada-Termination (Reversed)

Now, let's try building the Passive Voice verb-forms using "the Parassapada vibhattis". This is made possible by Sutta 518.

Please remember that these "parassapada" are actually "attanopada vibhattis" being reversed to look like "parassapada", not the original ones. Therefore, the voice will still remain Kammaspecific (**i.e.** passive voice) though.

Also please know that the actual "Parassapada vibhattis" never signify the sense of Kamma in any way. **They have only one** voice of Kattu (active voice). Therefore, they are always to be used in the active voice only. This is an important grammatical rule to be remembered.

Sample Passive Voice Verb in the reversed Parassapada-termination
(ti) Pacīyati. *Pacīye. **(anti)** Pacīyanti,*Pacīyare. (si) Pacīyasi. **(tha)** Pacīyatha. (mi) Pacīyāmi, *Pacīye ("ti, mi" sometimes changes into "e"). (ma) Pacīyāma.

CAUSATIVE VERBS
Like the plain verbs, there are two types of causative verbs. They are: (a) Causative verb in the active voice, (b) Causative verb in the passive voice. To be able to build causative verbs and to understand them well, the students need to understand two things which are fundamental to the core structural pattern of a causative verb.

They are: (1) The causative affixes, (2) Subsequent vuddhi procedures resulting from causative affix.

[This needs much study and practice].

## Method Causative Verb In The Active Voice

It will be explained here in a way as simple as possible for the students. First, there are four causative affixes which are mainly used in the causative verbs. They are "ṇe, ṇaya, **ṇāpe** and ṇāpaya". Please refer to **Sutta 438**. It is also important to understand that "ṇ" has to be removed from all the causative affixes as per **Sutta 523**. There will remain only "e, aya, āpe, **āpaya**". One of these affixes will be used in the sample causative verbs. Regarding the vuddhi procedure, refer to **Sutta 483**. It may at first seems like a big challenge for a beginner. But, it is not that much difficult if simple guidelines are understood. The vuddhi procedure usually occurs in the initial vowel of the root if that is a two-stem root. As an exception, there are some roots such as jīva-to live, **katha**-to speak, **kilamu**-to be weary, which never undergo a vuddhi procedure in a causative or even in the plain verb forms. Now, here is the formula of causative verb to remember: The root with an initial vowel being in a vuddhi+one of the four causative affixes+relevant **vibhatti** (3 integral parts).

Now, let's work out that formula here:
The root: **Paca**-to cook.

See the table below. All the complex structural patterns of causative verbs are shown in the table in a very simple way. 

[(1) Vuddhi procedure in the initial vowel of the root "a" as "ā", (2) the last component vowel of the root deleted, (3) the component consonant "ṇ" of the affix elided. Three important procedures]

| Base Structure   | After three Procedures               | The completed verb          |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Paca+ṇe+ti>      | Pāc+e+ti>     | Pāceti. (He) causes to cook |
| Paca+ṇaya+ti>    | Pāc+aya+ti>   | Pācayati.                   |
| Paca+ṇāpe+ti>    | Pāc+āpe+ti>   | Pācāpeti.                   |
| Paca+ṇāpaya+ti>  | Pāc+āpaya+ti> | Pācāpayati.                 |

## Sample Causative Verb In The Active Voice [Parassapada]

Now, let's start building causative verbs in the active voice: Root: Paca=to cook. (1st) **Affix:** "ṇe"
(ti) Pāceti. **(anti)** Pācenti ("a" of "anti" is deleted) (si) Pācesi. **(tha)** Pācetha. (mi) Pācemi. **(ma)** Pācema. [No dīgha procedure in "mi & ma"]
(2nd) **Affix:** "ṇaya"
(ti) Pācayati. **(anti)** Pācayanti ("a" of "anti" is deleted). (si) Pācayasi. **(tha)** Pācayatha. (mi) Pācayāmi. (**ma)** Pācayāma.[Dīgha procedure in "mi & ma"]
Note: In verbs with 3rd and 4th affixes, there can be some verb forms with no vuddhi function occurred on the initial vowel. So, two examples of verb forms are shown below.

(3rd) **Affix:** "ṇāpe"
(ti) Pācāpeti, pacāpeti. **(anti)** Pācāpenti, pacāpenti. (si) Pācāpesi, pacāpesi. (**tha)** Pācāpetha, pacāpetha. (mi) Pācāpemi, pacāpemi. **(ma)** Pācāpema, pacāpema.

[No dīgha procedure in "mi & ma"]

(4th) **Affix:** "ṇāpaya"
(ti) Pācāpayati, pacāpayati. **(anti)** Pācāpayanti, pacāpayanti. (si) Pācāpayasi, pacāpayasi.

 **(tha)** Pācāpayatha, pacāpayatha.

(mi) Pācāpayāmi, pacāpayāmi. (**ma)** Pācāpayāma, pacāpayāma. [Dīgha procedure in "mi & ma"]
Note: Please note that verbs in "ṇe and ṇāpe" affixes are slightly similar to each other while verbs in "ṇaya and ṇāpaya" affixes share some similar morphological traits. 

## Causative Verb In The Passive Voice

This too may be a bit challenging. But remember that it is very much similar to the plain verbs in respect of the passive voice structural pattern. It only needs **to insert one more affix "ya**" signifying the Kamma (passive voice). Here is one thing to be mindful that not all causative affixes are used in the passive voice structure. Only a few causative affixes, mostly "ṇe" and "ṇāpe" are found to be used in the Pāli literature. This does not mean that the remaining ones are not used at all. There could be some instances of usage. Please note that in the passive voice causative verbs, there used to be two or sometimes even three affixes though some traces of the causative affixes are not easily noticeable. Here is the formula to remember: **the root** with an initial vowel being a vuddhi+e or āpe+i or ī+ya+the relevant **Vibhatti**. (5 integral parts) Now, let's practically work out that formula here: The root: Paca-to cook Affix: ṇe or ṇāpe+ya.

Assume that all three basic procedures have already been done. So, it will be:
(a) Pāca+e+i+ya+ti > Pāciyati. [The trace of causative affix unnoticeable in this verb with the **"ṇe"** affix, as its residual vowel "e" is already absent except a vuddhi vowel "ā" representing it]
(b) Pāca+āpe+i+ya+ti >Pācāpiyati. [The trace of causative affix is slightly noticeable in this verb with the **"ṇāpe"** affix]

Verbs with affix: "ṇe" (ti) Pāciyati. **(anti)** Pāciyanti. (si) Pāciyasi. **(tha)** Pāciyatha. (mi) Pāciyāmi. **(ma)** Pāciyāma. [Dīgha procedure in "mi & ma"]
Verbs with affix: "ṇāpe"
(ti) Pācāpiyati. **(anti)** Pācāpiyanti. (si) Pācāpiyasi. **(tha)** Pācāpiyatha. (mi) Pācāpiyāmi. (**ma)** Pācāpiyāma. [Dīgha procedure in "mi &
ma"]
Note: These samples are to orient the student with the basic causative verb forms. It is important to study and familiarize with these sample verb forms as explained here.

*********

THE BASIC PĀLI SENTENCE STRUCTURE
Based on conjugation of the verbs and various verb-forms which have been explained thus far in some detail, some basic sentence structure and the relevant rules will be explained here for the benefit of all serious students of the Pāli grammar. There are, as a matter of the grammatical fact stated in Suttas, three voices in the Pāli grammar. They are: (a) the active voice (Kattu), (b) the passive voice (Kamma) and (c) the impersonal voice (Bhāva). Of the three, bhāva voice is rarely used in the actual usage of Pāli texts and a wider area of the Pāli literature except in the etymological definition of words in the Pāli grammar and some instances of the commentary and subcommentary texts where some detailed and delicate explanation is necessary regarding a word or a phrase. Even in this Kaccāyana's grammar, especially in Kita and Uṇādi chapters, bhāva voice known as Bhāva Sādhana is widely applied to explain some etymological definition of the example words using either an Ākhyāta verb or a Kita verb of bhāva sense and voice. Only active and passive voices are used in the majority of written Pāli texts. Therefore, fundamental rules and the writing-method of these two voices only will be explained.

## The Rules Of Active Voice Sentence

An active voice sentence is called in grammatical parlance as 
"Kattu-vācaka Vākya" which means the subject-principal sentence where Kattā (the agent, doer subject) is much more dominant. Such a subject is called "Kathita Kattā" or "Vutta-kattā" which means a predominant-subject. The object (Kamma) in such a sentence plays a secondary role. Hence it is called an 
"Akathita-kamma" or "Avutta-kamma" which means a nonprincipal object.

## 613 Here Are The Rules Of An Active Voice Sentence:

(1) The subject must be in the nominative case. (2) The object has to be in the accusative case. (3) The verb must be either in the parassapada-termination in most cases or in the attanopada-termination with or without an affix of Kattu-sense. [But affixes of Kamma sense such as ya, **tabba,** ta, etc. are absolutely inapplicable.] (Tabba & Ta are *Kita* affixes not to be used with Ākhyāta verbs) 
(4) The persons (subjects) and verbs should be concordant. Note: The rule numbers 3 and 4, are not required when writing active voice sentences using *Kita* verbs and *Kita* affixes of Kattu-sense or past perfect such as "ta". (Refer to Sutta 555, 557).

## Formula:

Subject+Object+Verb [S+V+O is possible and permissible although majority style is S+O+V]
Now, let us study the sample sentences shown in the table.

| Subject      | Object       | Verb                   |                                                            |
|--------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| (nominative) | (accusative) | (in kattuaffix "a")                        | Meaning                                                    |
| Puriso       | odanaṁ       | pacati                 | Man, the rice, cooks. (Man cooks  the rice).               |
| Purisā       | odanaṁ       | pacanti                | Men, the rice, cook. (Men cook  the rice).                 |
| Buddho       | dhammaṁ      | deseti disa-to  teach. | Buddha, the Dhamma, teaches.  (Buddha teaches the Dhamma). |
| Buddhā       | dhammaṁ      | desenti                | Buddhas, the Dhamma, teach.  (Buddhas teach the Dhamma).   |
| Tvaṁ         | odanaṁ       | pacasi                 | You cook the rice.                                         |
| Tumhe        | odanaṁ       | pacatha                | You (plural) cook the rice.                                |
| Ahaṁ         | odanaṁ       | pacāmi                 | I cook the rice.                                           |
| Mayaṁ        | odanaṁ       | pacāma                 | We cook the rice.                                          |

Please note that all the relevant subjects (persons), verbs and their numbers are to be in perfect agreement.

## The Rules Of Passive Voice Sentence

A passive voice sentence is called in grammatical parlance as 
"Kamma-vācaka Vākya" which means the object-principal sentence where the Kamma (the thing being done, the object) is more visibly dominant by being in the nominative case. Such an object is called "Kathita Kamma" or "Vutta-kamma" which means the predominant-object. The subject (Kattā) in such a sentence is called an "Akathita-kattā" or an "Avutta-kattā" which means the non-principal subject. The rules in a passive voice sentence are: (1) The subject has to be in the instrumental case. (2) The object has to be in the nominative case. (3) The verb should be mainly in the attanopada-termination or it can be in a reversed Parassapada form with an affix which has a Kamma-sense only.

[Refer to the verb and verb-forms shown in Suttas 440, 441 442 and 443.

The easiest verb-form to use is the type of verb affixed with a "ya" preceded by either an inserted "i" or "ī".]
(4) The object (not the subject!) and verb should be in agreement. Note: The rule number four is a major distinction of Sanskrit and Pāli passive voice sentences which is different from other grammars of modern languages such as English. In Sanskrit and Pāli grammar, the subject is dominant in the active voice. In the passive voice sentence, the object is dominant. So, the verb has to follow them accordingly. In English grammar, the subject is more emphasized in both active and passive voices. Therefore, the subject and verb are to be in perfect agreement with each other in both voices. 

| Subject        | Object       | Verb                       |                                                                       |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (instrumental) | (nominative) | (Kamma-affix "ya" and "ī") | Meaning                                                               |
| Purisena       | odano        | pacīyate                   | By man, the rice, is cooked  (The rice is cooked by man)              |
| Purisehi       | odano        | pacīyate                   | By men, the rice, is cooked  (The rice is cooked by men)              |
| Buddhena       | dhammo       | desīyate                   | By Buddha, the Dhamma,  is taught (The Dhamma is  taught by Buddha)   |
| Buddhehi       | dhammo       | desīyate                   | By Buddhas, the Dhamma,  is taught (The Dhamma is  taught by Buddhas) |
| Rājena         | tvaṁ         | dīyase                     | By king, you are given                                                |

## The Impersonal Voice

Q: What does an impersonal voice **(Bhāva) sentence** looks like in terms of the sentence structure?

A: It is much more like a passive voice sentence in the structural pattern except that it conveys a Bhāva sense of expressing just **mere action**. Neither the doer (subject) nor the thing being done (Kamma) is in fact implied as a principal focus or the subject matter of the sentence.

## The Applicable Person And Number

According to the most Venerable Buddhapiyācariya, the great grammarian of Rūpasiddhi Vyākaraṇa Pāli grammar, it is said that in a Bhāva (impersonal voice) sentence, only the paṭhama purisa (third person), **singular** number is applicable. No other (purisa) persons are applicable because Bhāva itself singularly 

signifies just mere action, not any materiality nor the physical tangibility of any sort as implied by the relevant roots of the verb. Re: Ākhyāta chapter, Rūpasiddhi Vyākaraṇa, Pāli grammar, in Sutta No. 446, (Attanopadāni parassapadattaṁ) which said:
"Bhāve Adabbavuttino Bhāvass'ekattā *ekavacana'meva.*
Tañ'ca *paṭhamapurisasse'va".*

## The Sample Sentences Of Impersonal Voice

(1) Devadattena (Devadatta, the subject) bhūyate. [bhū-to be]
(by Devadatta, became. **i.e.** Devadatta's being) 
(2) Pabbatena (the mountain, the subject) ṭhīyate. [ṭhā-to stand] (by the mountain, standing, **i.e.** The mountain's standing) 
(3) Purisena (by man, the subject) kathīyate. [**katha**-to speak] (by the man, said. **i.e.** The man speaks, or man's speaking) 
Note: Please note that strictly there is no applicable Kamma word (the object) in an impersonal voice sentence though it cannot be ruled out the likely presence of a Kamma word in a verb with sakammaka roots (transitive verb) of a Bhāva structure.

Sometimes, genitive case is also found to be employed in place of a subject in some Pāli writings although it is not a consistent pattern.

Re: Kaccāyana Vyākaraṇa, Sutta No. 556: "Bhāve tāva, Tassa Gītaṁ" etc. Here genitive case is used in the context of a *Kita* verb to signify a Bhāva voice and most possibly "the mere action".

## ********* 617 Sample Causative Sentence

There are **four integral parts** in a causative sentence. They are: (1) Causative subject (grammatically known as Hetu-kattā, or Payojaka-kattā, the prompter or the mover, abbreviated as CS),
(2) Subordinate Object (also called Kārita-kamma, causative object, CO),
(3) The root-object (also called dhātu-kamma, the object of the root which has direct connection to the root in terms of having direct relationship with the meaning of the root, RO),
(4) The causative verb, CV. Note that there used to be two objects in an ordinary causative sentence although sometimes there may be some more additional objects depending on nature of the root. For example, if the root is a dual-kamma-indicative root (dvikammaka) such as nī-to carry, **duha**-to milk, then there can be three objects.

This is a very simple causative sentence which is quite easy to understand. It is hoped that all the explanation given regarding the verbs and basic types of Pāli sentence structures thus far is sufficient for all keen students at this point to make the study of 

the next sections of the Pāli grammar much more easier and understandable for them.

## Exercises

By studying the example of verbs shown in all of Ākhyāta vibhattis along with sample active and passive voice sentences, it is hoped that the students will be able to do some practical drills by themselves using the following roots. (a) Now, please try conjugating one of the roots with any two or more vibhatti of your choice: (1) **paca**-to cook. (2) **vasa**-to dwell, to live. (3) **vada**-to speak. 

 (4) **labha**-to get, to obtain. (5) **sara-**to remember. (b) Please translate the following sentences and determine the voice of each sentence and the kind of possible sentence correctly. (1) Buddho vihāraṁ (the temple) gacchati. (2) Buddhā vihāraṁ (the temple) gacchanti. (3) Puriso gāmaṁ (the village) gacchati. (4) Purisā gāmaṁ (the village) gacchanti. (5) Purisena gāmo (the village) gacchiyate. (6) Purisehi dhammo cariyante. (the root "**cara**-to practice") (7) Puriso dhanaṁ (wealth) labhati. (the root "**labha**-to get") (8) Upāsako (the devotee) saggaṁ (Heaven) gacchati. (9) * Puriso purisaṁ gāmaṁ gacchāpeti.

[Please also determine the type of sentence after translating this]

Dutiya Kaṇḍa The Second Section 432, 362. DAtuil½eih prA pœcyA 
432, 362. **Dhātuliṅgehi parā paccayā31.** [Dhātuliṅgehi+parā+paccayā. 3 words]
[V] **Dhātu,liṅga**-icce'tehi parā **paccayā** honti.

"**paccaya**-the affixes" are to be applied after "**dhātu** (roots)" and "**liṅga** (words of the specific gender)". Summary: This Sutta enjoins to apply "paccaya":
(a) after the "**dhātu-**roots" in the case of verbs and kitanouns structured with roots,
(b) after "**liṅga-**gender-specific words" in the case of various kinds of nouns such as plain common nouns, Sabbanāma nouns, Samāsa nouns, Taddhita nouns and Kita nouns. What are the "**paccayas**"? Vibhattis and various *Taddhita, Ākhyāta* and *Kita* **affixes** are called "paccaya". Here is how to apply each relevant "paccaya": (a) First, **noun-vibhattis** (noun case-endings) such as paṭhamā (nominative case) etc. are to be applied after gender-specific nouns (Samāsa, Taddhita and Kita words are also included as they are classified as nouns).

(b) Ākhyāta vibhattis such as "**ti, anti**" and so forth, together with various **Ākhyāta affixes** are to be applied after the roots of Ākhyāta verbs.

(c) Kita affixes and **noun-vibhattis** are to be applied in the Kita-nouns.

(d) Those **Taddhita-affixes** and **noun-vibhattis** are to be applied after Taddhita-nouns according to their respective meanings as prescribed in the relevant Taddhita Suttas.

Ākhyāta Verb Examples cited in **Sutta**
(1) [Plain Verb] - karoti-(he) does. - gacchati-(he) goes.

(2) [Causative Verb] yo koci-whoever. karoti-does (an action). taṁto that person. añño-the other person. "karohi-do! karohi-do!" 
icce'vaṁ-as such. bravīti-says. **i.e.** Suppose someone is doing something, then someone come and says "do it, do it". This act of prompting is called a causative motive **(Payojaka vyāpāra)** which is expressed by such verbs as "**Kāreti, Kārenti**" etc. 

 atha vā-in other words, karontaṁ-(while one is) doing (something), payojayati-prompts. This act of prompting or urging results in such a causative verb as: - kāreti-(he) causes to do.

(3) [Nominal Verb] (a) saṅgho-the Sangha, monks. pabbata'miva
[**pabbataṁ**-mountain+iva-like] pabbataṁ iva-like mountain.

attāna'mācarati [**attānaṁ**-oneself+**ācarati**-practises] attānaṁoneself. ācarati-conducts (being unshaken by temptations).

- pabbatāyati-The Sangha conducts itself like mountain (when faced with temptations and defilements without being emotionally upset).

(b) taḷākaṁ-the reservoir. samudda'miva [**samuddaṁ**-sea+ivalike] samuddaṁ iva-like the sea. attāna'mācarati 
[attānaṁ+ācarati]
- samuddāyati-(The reservoir) behaves itself like an ocean.

i.e. The reservoir is so wide and big. As such, it seems like an ocean for its own size.

(c) saddo-the sound. cicciṭa'miva [**cicciṭaṁ**-sizzling sound+iva]
cicciṭaṁ iva-like a sizzling sound. attāna'mācarati. attānaṁitself. ācarati-acts. - cicciṭāyati-The sound acts itself like a sizzling sound.

The affixes thus applied are to be also formally termed as "**kārita-**the causative affix".

Example of Causative Singular verb, using the root "kara-to do"
(Please also refer to Sutta 432) 
See all four affixes "**ṇe, ṇaya, ṇāpe, ṇāpaya**" are applied in each verb. However, as the conjoined "ṇ" is to be elided as per morphological procedures, only "**e, aya, āpe, āpaya**" can be seen in the verbs (see these affixes underlined in the first set of examples. Also see the long vowel "ā" in the initial point of the verb which is a result of **vuddhi procedure** affected by "ṇ" affix).

A "ya" affix is added after all roots when signifying the senses of "**Bhāva** (impersonal voice)" and "**Kamma** (passive voice)". Note: The verbs affixed with "ya" applied by this Sutta play very important role as passive voice verbs in the Pāli texts. [See also Sutta No.447 for a similar kind of "ya" affix. The verbs affixed with it are the active voice verbs]
There are two kinds of ya-affixed verbs. **They are:** (a) The simple "ya-affixed" verbs, (b) The complex "ya-affixed" verbs augmented with simi-

 lar or dissimilar syllables.

## Explanation

(a) The first type of verbs are simple and easy to build and to understand as they do not have any complex morphological changes. They are usually structured by simply inserting either a "ya" affix only or putting one more vowel "i" or "ī" in front of "**ya".** They are usually one single-stem (one syllable) roots such as "nī" "dā" or ordinary double-stem or multiple-stem roots. [Refer to Sutta Nos. 442, 502]

## Example: Single-Stem Root Verbs:

Nīyati, (no morphological change in this verb except a "ya" affix being inserted between the root **"nī"** and vibhatti **"ti"** ) Dīyati, here, besides inserting "ya" affix, the vowel of the root is changed into an "ī". [Refer to Sutta No.502 to clarify this change]

## Multiple-Stem Root Verbs:

 Karīyati, (double-stem root, here, both "ī" and "ya" affixes are inserted. Refer to Sutta No. 442 to understand this function) The examples (1) & (5) shown in Sutta are such simple type of verbs.

(b) The verb-type "b" is a bit complex as the affix "ya" itself undergoes a word-form change and it is further augmented with either similar word of that changed letter or with a rather dissimilar word. As a result of complex morphologic changes, the affix "ya" becomes invisible in these verbs. [Refer to Suttas 441, 443, 444, 487, 488 for more clarification].

Examples (3) (6) (7) below are augmented with similar words while examples (2) and (4) are augmented with dissimilar words. If one carefully studies the examples below, it will be easy to understand these different struc-

tural patterns of ya-affixed verbs. To highlight these unique patterns, all the examples are shown underlined.

(1) - ṭhīyate-act of standing. [wa] ṭhā+ya+te (2) - bujjhate-act of knowing, (It is) known. [wa] budha+ya+te
(3) - paccate-act of cooking, (It is) cooked. [wa] paca+ya+te
(4) - labbhate-act of obtaining, (It is) obtained. [wa] labha+ya+te (5) - karīyate-act of doing, (It is) done. [wa] kara+ya+te (6) - yujjate-act of beating or yoking. (It is) beaten, or is bound.

 [wa] yudha or yuja+ya+te (2 possible roots) 
(7) - uccate-act of speaking, (It is) spoken. [wa] uca+ya+te Note: There are two types of translations in each example. The first is a "**Bhāva translation**" while the second signifies "**Kamma translation".**

Note: Please keep in mind that in each pair of verbs, the first is of Attanopada verb-group while **the second verb form is a reversed verbform of Attanopada into Parassapada.** However, the voice still remains only in passive mode regardless of change. Of also greatly important is to note that these verb-forms applied by the function of this Sutta are **for purely passive voice use only.** They are never to be used in the active voice mode like the verbs which share the same morphological procedures prescribed in Sutta 441, 442, 443. They can be used interchangeably either as active or passive voice depending on the sense and voice of affix "ya" in addition to contextual nature of sentence. For example, being in the presence or absence of an Avutta-kattā 
(**i.e.** non-principal subject) in a sentence. This means that: (a) If the sense and voice of the affix "ya" is Kamma as per Sutta 440, and have a non-principal subject (Avutta-kattā) in the sentence, then it will surely be a passive voice verb.

(b) If it is a "ya" affix as per Sutta 447 without the presence of an Avutta-kattā (non-principal subject) in the sentence, then it will be an active voice verb.

443, 449. **Pubbarūpañ'ca.** [Pubbarūpaṁ+ca. 2 words]
[V] Sabbehi dhātūhi yapaccayo **pubbarūpa**'māpajjate vā.

A "ya" affix sometimes undergoes a morphological procedure of **pubbarūpa**, (changing into a consonant similar to the last consonant of the root). [**Pubba**-of front, the preceding letter of the root. **i.e.** the last consonant of root+**rūpa**-shape. **i.e.** assimilation].

Note: Example verb (1) and (5) are anomalous verbs.

(1) - vuḍḍhate-(It's) grown. [wa] vaḍha+ya+te  In the example above, the affix "y" changed into "ḍh". So it becomes
"vaḍh+ḍha+te" [It is still a pubbarūpa, similar syllables]. Later on, the last word of the root has to be changed into a "ḍ" by Sutta 612. 

The "a" of "va" further changes into an "u" by Sutta 517 bringing the word to completion. (This is an anomalous verb of dissimilar syllables whose morphological procedure is a bit complex for the beginners).

(2) - phallate-(It is) finished or come to fruition.

 [wa] phala+ya+te In this example, the affix "y" changed into "l". [This is a simple pubbarūpa verb of similar syllables]
(3) - dammate-(It is) tamed. [wa] damu+ya+te In this example, the affix "y" changed into "m". [This is a simple pubbarūpa verb of similar syllables]
(4) - sakkate-(It is) honored. [wa] saka+ya+te In this example, the affix "y" changed into "k". [This is a simple pubbarūpa verb of similar syllables]
(5) - labbhate-(It is) obtained. [wa] labha+ya+te In this example, the affix "y" changed into "bh". Later on, the last consonant "bh" of the root is to be changed into "b" by Sutta 20 or 517 [This is an anomalous verb with dissimilar augmentation]

(6) - dissate-(It is) seen. [wa] disa+ya+te In this example, the affix "y" changed into "s". [This is a simple pubbarūpa verb of similar syllables or assimilation]

[V] Yathā heṭṭhā bhāvakammesu yapaccayassa ādeso hoti, tathā kattari'pi yapaccayassa ādeso kātabbo. The morphological procedures on "ya" affix prescribed in previous Suttas are to be similarly applied to "ya" affix (of active voice as prescribed in forthcoming Sutta 447 "Divā' dito yo").

Note: This Sutta enjoins that the two functions of Sutta 441, 443 are to be similarly applied on the "ya-affixed verbs" of Sutta 447 too. So, the function of all examples are easily understandable. The only difference is that these verbs are not applicable for the reversal procedure into Parassapada as they themselves are basically of the Parassapadas whose voice is always "active voice". This is the reason why the verb-ending is only Parassapada "ti", not "te". (See the applied-functions in the examples shown underlined.) 
(1) - bujjhati-(He) knows. [wa] budha+ya+ti (2) - vijjhati-(It) penetrates. (as with a sharp object or by means of sharp intellect) [wa] vidha+ya+ti

Pubbe **niggahitā**'gamo hoti. An "a" affix is to be added after the root "**rudha**" etc. in the sense of the active voice (Kattā). Besides, a "**niggahita**" is also to be put on top of the first component consonant of the root.

Note: That Niggahita later changes into one of "ṅ, ñ, ṇ, n, m" based on 

the next consonant it precedes as prescribed in Sutta 31. The transformed "n" of niggahita is shown in bold, underlined.

Note: In Sutta 468, 469, the structures of verbs are so simple that sometimes it may be unnecessary to apply an affix such as "a". But, some teachers used to hold the strict view that there should be an affix of Kattu sense in it to signify the relevant voice. Even if the affix is applied, it has to be elided by Sutta 510. In WA of examples, some are shown with an affix and some are not. This is a delicate minor grammatical matter.

However, the golden rule is that it makes a grammatical sense to have at 

least one appropriate affix even though without an affix, the applied vibhattis can still signify the voice (Refer to Suttas 453, 456). As such, in cases where the structure of the verb is so simple and does not require any complex morphological procedure, it is still possible for such simple verbs without an affix.

The component vowel of non-conjunct root undergoes the process of "**vuddhi**" in verbs where causative affixes are applied after them. [The applied vuddhi vowels are shown in bold] - kāreti-(He) causes to do. - kārenti-(They) cause to do. - kārayati, - kārayanti, - kārāpeti, - kārāpenti, - kārāpayati, - kārāpayanti. [Refer to Sutta 438] Asaṁyoga'ntasse'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "asaṁyogantassa" for?

To show that the examples shown below are not 45**Vuddhi** means an increase in the metrical nature of the word. Through this procedure, "a" changes into "ā", "i" changes into "ī", "u" changes into "**ū".** 
This may seems like similar to "dīgha-the lengthening process" of rassa **i.e.**
short vowels. But it is somewhat different in terms of how it takes place. In addition, "i" **and "ī**" changes into "e", while "**u & ū**" changes into "o". This process of morphing into another different vowel form is called "**vuddhi**". Furthermore, "e" becomes either "aya" or "āya" while "o" also becomes "ava" **or "āva**" by means of another follow-up procedure called "**anuvuddhi**" (anu-means following, **i.e.** a follow-up procedure after vuddhi has been applied in some words). All three Suttas from 483, 484, 485, perform vuddhi function. Only 483-485 have a wider application while Sutta 484 is confined to only a few roots in its function. 46 "**Asaṁyoganta**" means ending in non-conjunct. [A-not, **saṁyoga**-being well-joined in a cluster of words, **i.e.** conjunct, **anta**-ending] The conjunctconsonants are clearly noticeable in the oriental Asian scripts which used to be written in vertical order in the languages such as Devanāgari and Burmese etc. In the Romanized Pāli which used to be written in horizontal mode, it may not be easily noticeable. However, when double, vowel-less consonants of similar or dissimilar shape are present in the root, it can be easily assumed as "**saṁyoganta dhātu** (the conjunct-ending root)".

"asaṁyoganta-single consonant words", but "saṁyogantaconjunct-consonants words". So, they are inapplicable. (See conjuncts in the verbs shown in bold, underlined)

Sometimes, the Attanopada vibhattis assume the physical mode of Prassapada vibhattis (except in terms of actual voice.) 
This means that they can take physical appearance of the Parassapada vibhattis by having all six prassapada-terminations at the end of verbs as if they are Prassapada. However, the voice still remains in passive voice. Sometimes it is referred to as reversal of Attanopada vibhattis into Parassapada **vibhattis.** In the examples below, see the underlined Parassapada verb-endings shown in bold. Actually, they are reversed from Attanopada verb-ending "te" to "ti". Therefore, in WA, it has to be shown as "te" to represent its true Vibhatti.

An affix "ṇa" is to be applied after the root which is preceded by a Kamma (an object in accusative case).

Summary: This Sutta applies a "ṇa" affix after the roots preceded by a Kamma (a noun in accusative case). This noun in accusative case is known as "saddūpapada" which means a near-by word, closely located in front of the 

roots "kara" etc. [saddū'papada=**sadda**-syllable+upa-near+**pada**word]
Actually, the words shown as examples in Suttas 524, 525 are compound nouns known grammatically as "Kita'ntogadha dutiyā Tappurisa". Therefore, in the word analysis of each example, the front component parts of the words such as **kamma-**work**, kumbha-**pot**, mālā-**flower and so forth are to be regarded as saddūpapada, **i.e.** the preceding near-by words. "kara, gaha" and so on are the roots after which an affix "ṇa" is to be applied. [Kita'ntogadha=**Kita**-a kita-noun+**antogadha**-inside. **i.e.** compound noun with a Kita-word inside as a component]
(1) kammaṁ-work. karotī'ti [karoti+iti] karoti-does. iti-for this reason] kammakāro-is called "kammakāra". - kammakāro-the one who does work, **i.e.** worker, laborer.

## 700 Detailed Explanation

[As the rule of Sutta and the related morphological procedures are a bit complex for uninitiated beginner, a simple explanation is given below.]
First, look at the WA of the word "**antako**" as shown above.

(a) Here (refer to wa of item 1, shown above), the root is "**kara**". The first 
"a" after "k" as well as the vowel-less "r" are to be deleted along with the applied affix "ra" leaving only the words "**Anta+k**".

Note: Assume that "r" is vowel-less as its "a" had been already elided by Sutta 521 in the initial procedure of morphology for this word. It will then look like this=**anta+k**.

(b) Then, this pending incomplete word "**anta+k**" is to be formally recognized as a noun by means of Sutta 601.

(c) Only after this formal recognition procedure, a nominative singular "si" can be applied. Thus, > anta+k+si.

(d) Then, that "si" is to be changed into "o" by 104> **antako** (complete) 
[Through such a detailed step-by-step morphological process, this word becomes a complete word]

[V] **Taddhita,samāsa,kitaka-**icce'va'mantā saddā nāmaṁ'va daṭṭhabbā **tave,tuna,tvāna,tvā**dipaccaya'nte vajjetvā. All the words processed by due morphological procedures as prescribed in relevant Suttas and explained in the sections of Taddhita, Samāsa and Kitaka, except those words ending in affixes tave, tuna, **tvāna** and tvā etc., are to be recognized as nouns. Summary: This Sutta enjoins to formally recognize all Samāsa words, Taddhita-affixed words, Kita-affixed words as nouns except those Kita-words suffixed with tave, **tuna**, tvāna and tvā affixes.

## The Benefit Of Recognition

After this formal recognition as nouns, the noun-vibhatti (case-terminations) can be applied after them. Then, all the necessary steps of morphological procedures are carried out 

and thus these formally recognized nouns become complete words to convey the relevant meanings in a sentence. **Note:** All other indeclinable affixes such as tuṁ, khattuṁ, thaṁ, dhā, to, dā, dāni and so on are to be excluded. This exclusion means that words affixed with such indeclinable affixes are neither required to formalize as nouns nor any specific morphological procedure be performed on them. As a result, such words with indeclinable affixes will remain unchanged without any specific declension contingent on caseending of nouns.

- vāsiṭṭho (Re Sutta 344).

- pattadhammo-the one who have attained Dhamma. [Tatiyā Bahubbhīhi compound] - kumbhakāro. (Re Sutta 524) 
icce'va'mādi.

Note: Those ending in affixes "tave", "tuna", "**tvāna**" and "tvā" are indeclinable. They do not have any gender and numbers. As such, do not require to be recognized as nouns. That is why they are excluded.

Q: Why compound-nouns, words in Taddhita-affixes and Kita-affixes are to be formally recognized as nouns by this Sutta?

A: The purpose is to bring such kind of words to completion in the same way as ordinary nouns are completed by applying all necessary vibhattis (noun-case endings) and performing due morphological procedures on them.

This Sutta is a proof which affirms the fact that all Taddhita, Samāsa and Kita words too are actually nouns in different forms.

[wa] upanaya+ṇika (This word is a Taddhita noun) 
Q: Why it has to be regarded as "**garu**-heavy syllable" and "**lahu**-light syllable"? A: To make the students understand a very basic matter of metrical measurement of the garu and lahu, which has to be applied in the art of composing Pāli verses. It further provides the student with basic knowledge in the study of Pāli prosody and learning of the necessary stress, rhythm and intonation so that reciting of Pāli proses and texts can be done correctly. Note: The recitation period of a garu syllable is two morae while it is one mora for reciting a lahu syllable.

[V] Nakāra,makāra,kakāra,rakārānaṁ dhātva'ntānaṁ lopo na hoti i-kārayutte ta-paccaye pare. The last component consonants "n, m, k, r" (of the roots "hana, gamu, ramu, saka, **kara**" etc.) are not to be elided in "ta-affixed" words when "**an inserted i**" is already in place. [Refer to Sutta 605 for "i"]
Summary: This Sutta enjoins not to elide the last consonants of the root in the "**ta-affixed words**" when an inserted "i" have been already applied in the word.

What does this injunction mean? It means that to form a very simple word-structure and word-form of "ta-affixed" verbs and verbal nouns, is only to apply the affix "ta" and insert an "i" between the root and affix. There is no need either to elide the last consonant of the root nor to do any other specific morphological change if these two functions have been already applied **on such words.**
See the examples carefully to clarify this. Throughout Pāli texts, such words are found aplenty. It is a very simple word-form of ta-affixed words. It should be noted that even though it is generally said in Sutta as "**tamhi**-ta-affixed", **all ta-containing affixes are also applicable** in view of a wider usage of such examples found in the Pāli texts.

Q: What kind of ta-containing affixes are applicable then? A: They are, tabba, tuṁ, tvā, **tvāna**, etc.

["**tuna, tave, tāye, tavantu, tāvi** and **teyya**" affixes are inapplicable. Please see the morphological structure of each word shown in the first square bracket before WA to clarify the rule of this Sutta.

(1) - hanituṁ-to kill. [hana+i+tuṁ] [wa] hana+tuṁ (2) - gamito-gone. [gamu+i+ta] [wa] gamu+ta (3) - ramito-rejoiced. [ramu+i+ta] [wa] ramu+ta (4) - sakito-honored. [saka+i+ta] [wa] saka+ta

(5) - sarito-remembered. [sara+i+ta] [wa] sara+ta (6) - karitvā-having done. [kara+i+tvā] [wa] kara+tvā ni'yuttatamhī'ti kimatthaṁ? What is the word "ni'yuttatamhi" for?

To show that in the examples shown below, there is no "i" in them. So, the last component of the root is elided. By word "vā", it means that restriction placed by this Sutta, is not always applied except in some instances of words where an "i" is already present with a "**ta-affix**" applied behind the root.

* gato-gone. [wa] gamu+ta * sato-remembered. [wa] sara+ta

The function of changing the last component consonants "c, j" of the roots into "**ka, ga**" is inapplicable when a "ṇvu" affix follows. Summary: This Sutta debars the function of Sutta 623 in words with a "ṇvu" affix having already been applied. Why? Because it is a very consistent pattern of the language for any ṇvu-affixed word to change into an "aka" as per Sutta 622. There is no other morphological procedure affecting on "ṇvu-affixed words" except the "aka" function and a vuddhi process where necessary.

The component vowels "**i, ya, ta, ma, ki, e, sa**", which are parts of their respective Sabbanāma nouns change into dīgha (long vowels). The vowel "i" of the root "**disa**" changed into a guṇa "ī". The letter "d" of the root "**disa**" changes into an "r" and the component consonant "s" of the root "**disa**" changes into "sa, **kkha, ī**". Each of these words are to be morphologically completed not contravening the prevalent usage in the Pāli texts.

## Explanation

On Parts of Sabbanāma Nouns and Three Functions of Sutta I is part of **ima** (this), ya is part of ya (which), ta is part of ta (that), ma is part of **amha** (me), ki is part of **kiṁ** (what, interrogative), e is part of **eta** (that), sa is part of **samāna** (same, similar).

(1) Of all these, all "i, a" vowels in each sabbanāma-words except "e" of "eta", are to undergo the "dīgha" process of lengthening. Thus, each is lengthened as "**ī, yā, tā, mā, kī,** sā".

(2) The "d" of the root word "**disa**" changes into an "r". (3) "s" of "**disa**" changes into "**sa, kkha, ī**". [Changing "s" of "disa" into "s" is a redundant function of affirmation.]
Note: There is a hidden function not shown in the Vutti of Sutta. It is to change "**amha**" into "ma", "eta" into "e" and "**samāna**" into "sa" by this Sutta and to lengthen inherent vowels into dīgha. In **Rūpasiddhi**, it is said: "ma-iti nipātanena **amha**saddassa mādeso. e-iti nipātanena etasaddassa ekāro. sa-iti nipātanena **samāna**saddassa sādeso, ta'dantassa vā dīgho". 

(Rūpasiddhi Grammar, Sutta 588) 
There is also a Sutta (sm;ned' ikmd" seKy;m) U in the **Mugdhabhoda** Sanskrit grammar with somewhat similar function which changes "samāna" into "sa", 
"idam" into "ī", "kiṁ" into "kī" and "ada" into "amū".

The **following are examples where the lengthening procedure of dīgha** 
process takes place in the initial vowels excluding "e" of "eta". Only one function is applied in these examples.

(1) ima'miva [imaṁ+iva] imaṁ iva-like this person. naṁ-to that person. passatī'ti [passati+iti] passati-(he) sees. iti - īdiso-suchlike person or such-kind-of person.

[wa] ima-saddūpapada-disa+kvi
(2) ya'miva [yaṁ+iva] yaṁ iva-like any person. naṁ passatī'ti
- yādiso-any-kind-of person. [wa] ya-saddūpapada-disa+kvi
(3) ta'miva [taṁ+iva] taṁ iva-like that person. naṁ passatī'ti 
- tādiso-that-kind-of person. [wa] ta-saddūpapada-disa+kvi
(4) ma'miva [maṁ+iva] maṁ iva-like me. naṁ passatī'ti 
- mādiso-me-like person, or a person like me. [wa] amha-saddūpapada-disa+kvi
(5) kim'iva [kiṁ+iva] kiṁ iva-like who. naṁ passatī'ti - kīdisowhich kind of person. [wa] kiṁ-saddūpapada-disa+kvi
(6) eta'miva [etaṁ+iva] etaṁ iva-like that person. naṁ passatī'ti
- ediso-that-kind-of person. [wa] eta-saddūpapada-disa+kvi Note: "eta" changes into "e" by this Sutta. If this function is not applied, then the lengthening procedure is applicable thereby resulting in the word form "etādiso", which is also widely found in the Pāli texts.

(7) samāna'miva [samānaṁ+iva] samānaṁ iva-like same person.

naṁ passatī'ti - sādiso-similar-kind-of person. [All Kattusādhana EDs] [wa] samāna-saddūpapada-disa+kvi In the following examples, besides a dīgha process in the initial vowels, "d" of the root "disa" also changes into "r". However, the meanings and ED of each example **and WA are the same. See all** 
the **examples carefully to clarify two applied functions.**
(1) ima'miva naṁ passatī'ti - īriso. (2) ya'miva naṁ passatī'ti - yāriso. (3) ta'miva naṁ passatī'ti - tāriso. (4) ma'miva naṁ passatī'ti - māriso.

(5) kim'iva naṁ passatī'ti - kīriso. (6) eta'miva naṁ passatī'ti - eriso.

[one "r" changing function only, no dīgha function]
(7) samāna'miva naṁ passatī'ti - sāriso. [All Kattu-sādhana]
In the following examples, apart from a dīgha process in the initial vowels, "s" of the root "disa" changes into "kkh". The meanings and all EDs of each example **and WA are the same though.**
(1) ima'miva naṁ passatī'ti - īdikkho. (2) ya'miva naṁ passatī'ti - yādikkho. (3) ta'miva naṁ passatī'ti - tādikkho. [Kattu-sādhana] Evaṁ (4) - mādikkho. (5) - kīdikkho. (6) - edikkho. (7) - sādikkho.

In the following examples, besides dīgha process, "sa" **of the root** "disa" changes into an "ī". The meanings and ED of each examples and WA are the same.

(1) - īdī. (2) - yādī. (3) - tādī. (4) - mādī. (5) - kīdī. (6) - edī. (7) - sādī. Caggahaṇena tesa'meva saddānaṁ **i, ya,** icce'va'mādīna' manto ca saro **kvaci** dīghatta'māhu. By means of the word "ca" in Sutta, those initial vowels of "i, ya, etc." are said to be made into a "dīgha".

This function is already shown in the main Sutta. Hence, it seems like redundant. Note that there is no "dīgha" process in four examples shown with this asterisk mark * [WA of each example is the same as shown before]
(1) - īdikkho. (2) - yādikkho. (3) - tādikkho. (4) - mādikkho. (5) - kīdikkho. (6) *• edikkho. (7) - sādikkho-same-kind-of-person. [wa] samāna-saddūpapada-disa+kvi 
 (WA of 2, 3, 4 below are the same as **this)** 
(1) - īdiso. [wa] ima-saddūpapada-disa+kvi.

No dīgha in three examples below.

(2) *• sadiso-same-kind-of-person. (3) *• sariso-same-kind-of-person. (4) *• sarikkho-same-kind-of person.

i.e. You should not go to any partial, biased action.

[wa] agati=na-saddūpapada-gamu+ti

## Note: The Words With This "Āni" Affix Used In This Context Are Seldom Found In The Tipiṭaka Canonical Texts. 646, 419. Akþaidto Sikþ‰S Ekøaum 646, 419. Ekā'Dito Sakissa Kkhattuṁ. [Eka-Ādito+Sakissa+Kkhattuṁ. 3 Words] [V] Ekā'Dito Sakissa Kkhattuṁ Hoti.

The *nipāta* particle "**sakiṁ**-times" applied after numerical nouns "eka" etc, changes into "**kkhattuṁ**".

Note: When expressing "one time", the "**kkhattuṁ**" affix denoting time and frequency, is suffixed after numerical words and (other words) 
like "**eka-one**" etc. It is an indeclinable affix without gender. It rather serves as an adverb of frequency or times in a sentence.

(1) ekassa-of one. pada'tthassa-the meaning of word. sakiṁ-one time. vāraṁ-one turn. **i.e.** the meaning of one word for one-time as well as one-turn. - ekakkhattuṁ-is called "ekakkhattuṁ" which means "once, one time". [wa] eka+kkhattuṁ (eka etc. is not the root, but numeral noun) 
(2) dvinnaṁ-of two. pada'tthānaṁ-the meaning of words. sakiṁ vāraṁ - dvikkhattuṁ-twice, two times. [wa] dvi+kkhattuṁ
(3) tiṇṇaṁ-of three. pada'tthānaṁ sakiṁ vāraṁ - tikkhattuṁthrice, three times. [wa] ti+kkhattuṁ evaṁ

[wa] dasa+kkhattuṁ Icce'va'mādayo saddā yojetabbā. Such words should be applied. Note: According to prevalent view of the Pāli grammarians, this morpheme, "**kkhattuṁ**" should be regarded as an indeclinable affix denoting frequency or times which does not have gender. The "**kkhattuṁ**-affixed word" usually plays the role of an adverb in the sentence.

This Sutta enjoins to apply two affixes in the sense of future. Actually, the affix "ṇī" alone is sufficient to complete these words used in the context of future sense in this Sutta. The examples affixed with "**ghiṇ-affix**" are found to be very much the same like "ṇī". 

As a matter of fact, it could be a redundant affix as it is very much simi-

lar to "ṇī" affix shown in Suttas 532 (Kita chapter), 636. To clarify this, there is an affix "i`nu,Ò" which seems strikingly similar to "**ghiṇ-affix**" 
of this Sutta found in Kṛdanta affixes section, Sutta Numbers 3121, 3122, 3123, 3124, 3125 of **Siddhanta-Kaumudi Sanskrit Grammar,** PP 129-131. Some of the examples shown in those Sutta are: **Damī**

[wa] bhikkha+āna Note: There are differing views regarding the affixes of Sutta. According to the current version of Kaccāyana text and its examples, there will be four affixes. 

(a) In the second opinion of Rūpasiddhi in Sutta 650, it is said "**ssantu**iti eko'va paccayo daṭṭhabbo". [Trans] It should be regarded **ssantu** as one complete affix, not ssaṁ and ntu separately. 

But Rūpasiddhi accepted the affix "māna and āna" without any different opinion. 

(b) *Tha-bye-kan* Sayādaw, one of the most respectable Pāli scholars of Burma, is of the opinion that the actual affixes applicable by this Sutta in all likelihood should be **"ssantu, ssamāna and āna"** affixes. He has strong reasons for having this view based on his wide knowledge of the Sanskrit grammar texts.

(c) In Moggalāna Pāli grammar, Khādikaṇḍa section, there is a Sutta 
"Te ssapubbā'nāgate, aw \ykAŠm³em*aw", with its two examples shown as "ṭhassanto, ṭhassamāno". See the double **"ss"** in the affix-position carefully.

(d) In Kātantra Grammar, Kṛdanta chapter, the fourth section, there is a Sutta titled "xN];n* Sys'iht* xeWe c", with the examples shown as "kirXyn v[jit" kirXym;,o v[jit" Karissaṁ vajati, Karissamāno vajati". 

In light of these facts, the affixes applicable by this Sutta are more likely **"ssantu, ssamāna and āna"**. In this case, the examples will have to reflect the affixes such as "**(a)** Karissaṁ, Karissanto, Karissamāno, Karāno, **(b)** Buñjissaṁ, Buñjissanto, Buñjissamāno, Buñjāno" and so forth.

The words in these affixes are sometimes called "future participles" according to their contextual position in a sentence. Except in the case of āna-affixed example, it is a common pattern of language to have an "i" after the root and a double **"ss"** in the affix or verb-termination in such words of simple structure when denoting the future. The words in affix "āna" are frequently found in the Pāli texts such as "sayāno, anupādiyāno, jigīsāno, esāno" and so on.

## Sample Morphology

Note: Studying morphological procedure is an important part of grammar study in the ancient times. It helps students learn how a word is evolved till it becomes a complete word after a series of procedures as prescribed in relevant Suttas are being carried out. It is in fact an active process of grammatical dynamics pursued by ancient students which is both interesting and enriching.

Studying the meaning of various Suttas and relevant examples alone is not enough for a serious student as it may seem like quite a quiescent process. It has tremendous impact in the development of grammatical knowledge and in gaining the mastery of the language effectively in the process. A few samples of systematic morphological procedures are shown below. Keep in mind that there are different steps for each word according to their grouping as a noun, or compound noun, or a Taddhitaaffixed noun, or an Ākhyāta verb, or Kita and Uṇādi-affixed words. [Morphological procedures for Sandhi are already shown in the Sandhi chapter.]

## Noun Words

Steps of the procedures: (1) Set up the base according to its natural ending category of the vowel. (2) Apply the applicable vibhatti (case-ending) after it.

(3) Perform necessary functions till it becomes a complete word.

(a) **Puriso**-man. (Nominative Singular) [Re: Sutta 104] [1] Set up the base as **Purisa** [This is a crude noun-form] [2] Apply a nominative, singular "si" after it> **purisa+si** [3] Change "si" into "o" by 104 > **Purisa+o** [4] Elide the last "a" of purisa and keep it as it is by 83
> **puris+o** (It thus becomes a complete word) 
(b) **Purisā**-men (Nominative Plural) [Re: Sutta 107] [1] Set up the base as Purisa

[2] Apply a nominative plural "yo" after it> **Purisa+yo** [3] Change "yo" into "ā" by 107 > **Purisa+ā** [4] Elide the last "a" of Purisa and keep it as it is by 83
> **Puris+ā** (It becomes a complete word) 

## Ākhyāta Verbs

Steps of the procedures: (1) Set up the root as a base. (2) Declare the relevant meaning of the root and formally name it as a root by 457.

(3) Elide the last vowel of the root as necessary by 521. (4) First, apply applicable Vibhatti after the root and then apply an applicable affix between the root and vibhatti.

(5) Perform any necessary morphological procedure till it becomes a complete verb.

(a) **Gacchati**-(He) goes. [Re: Sutta 476] (An Ākhyāta verb, in present tense, third person singular "ti" termination) 
[1] **Gamu**-*gatimhi*-to go. [2] Elide the last vowel of the root "u" by 521> gam
[3] Apply a verb termination in present tense, third person singular "ti" by 414 after the root > **gam+ti**
[4] Then, apply an affix "a" in the sense of a Kattā (active voice) right after the root by Sutta 445 > **gam+a+ti**
[5] Change "m" of the root into "cch" by 476> **ga+cch+a+ti** (It becomes a complete word). (b) **Gacchanti**-(They) go. [Re: Sutta 410] (An Ākhyāta verb, in present tense, third person plural "anti" termination) 
[1] Gamu-gamane-to go. [2] Elide the last vowel of the root "u" by 521> gam
[3] Apply a verb termination in present tense, third person plural "anti" by 414 after the root> **gam+anti**
[4] Then, apply an affix "a" in the sense of a Kattā (active voice) right after the root> **gam+a+anti**
[5] Change "m" of the root into "cch" by 476 > **ga+cch+a+anti**
(Remember, one "a" is still needed to be elided).

[6] Elide the affix "a" by 510> **ga+cch+anti** (The completed word) 

## Kita-Affixed Words

Steps of the procedures: (1) Set up the root as a base.

(2) Declare relevant meaning of the root and name it as a root.

(3) Elide the last vowel of the root as necessary. (4) Apply applicable affix after the root. (5) Perform any necessary morphological procedure. (6) When all is done, formally recognize it as a noun.

(7) Apply a noun vibhatti case-ending after it and do all necessary further morphological procedures as those prescribed in normal noun words.

Note: There are two stage-procedures: 
(a) **Step 1-5** are Kita-morphological procedures. 

(b) **The remaining steps** are noun procedures. 

The procedure for uṇādi-affixed words are similar to that of Kitaaffixed words.

(a) **Cāgo**-charitable giving, sharing [Re: Sutta 529] [1] **Caja**-*cāge*-to share generously [2] Elide the last vowel of the root> caj [3] Apply a "ṇa" affix after the root by 529> **caj+ṇa** [4] recognize the ṇ-containing affix as a Kārita by 621 [5] Then elide that "ṇ" by 523> **caj+a** [6] Then apply a "vuddhi" function on the first "a" of "caj" by 483> **cāja** (It becomes an "ā" as a result of Vuddhi function) 
[7] Change "j" into "g" by 623> **cāga** [8] Recognize this almost-finished word "cāga" in transit as a noun by 601
[9] Apply a noun-vibhatti in nominative singular "si" after it >
cāga+si
[10] Change "si" into "o"> **cāga+o**. Next apply step 4 procedure as mentioned in Puriso. (It thus becomes a complete word "cāgo".) 
(b) **Buddho**-The one who knows truth, who awakened. [Re Sutta 557] [1] **Budha**-*ñāṇe*-to know, *jāgaraṇe-*to wake up. [2] Elide the last vowel of the root> Budh

[3] Apply a "ta" affix after the root by 557> **Budh+ta** [4] Change the affix "ta" applied after dh-ending root into
"dha" by 576> **Budh+dha**
[5] Then, change "dh" of the root into "d" by 611> **Bud+dha** [6] Recognize this almost-finished word "Bud+dha" in transit as a noun by 601.

[7] Apply a noun-vibhatti in nominative singular "si" after it >
Buddha+si
[8] Change "si" into "o"> **Buddha+o**. Next apply the step 4 procedure as mentioned in Puriso ("Buddho" completed.) 

## Uṇādi-Affixed Words

(a) **Samatho**-that which calms the mind, Samatha meditation. [Re: Sutta 628]
[1] **Sama**-*upasame*-to calm
[2] Apply a "tha" affix after the root by 628> **Sama+tha** (No need to elide the last vowel of the root) 
[3] Recognize this word "Sama+tha" in transit as a noun by 601.

[4] Apply a noun-vibhatti in nominative singular "si" after it >
Samatha+si
[5] Change "si" into "o"> **Samatha+o**. [6] Next apply the step 4 procedure as mentioned in Puriso. (It becomes a complete word "Samatho".) 
(b) **Gehaṁ**-home [A neuter gender word in nominative singular, Re: Sutta 629]
[1] **Gaha**-*gahaṇe*-to take. [2] Elide the last vowel of the root> gah [3] Apply an "a" affix after the root by 527> **Gah+a** [4] Then apply the function of changing the near-by first vowel 
"a" of "Gah" into "e" by 629> **Geha**
[5] Recognize this half-finished word "Geha" in transit as a noun by 601.

[6] Apply a noun-vibhatti in nominative singular "si" after it >
Geha+si
[7] Then, change "si" into "aṁ" by Sutta 219> **Geha+aṁ.** [8] Next apply step 4 procedure as mentioned in Puriso.

(It thus becomes a complete word "Gehaṁ") 

## Compound Nouns

Steps of the procedures: (1) Set up all component words in crude-forms as a base.

(2) Apply a vibhatti after each base-word.

(3) Perform any necessary morphological procedure as shown in nouns chapter till it becomes a complete ED with coherent and relevant meaning. (4) Then, declare the meaning of ED and name it as a compound noun. 

 Also give a relevant specific name of compound.

(5) Delete all the applied vibhatti and all morphological traces of change till it returns to its initial crude-stage of the base.

(6) Then, recognize it as a noun and apply any necessary procedure as explained below until it becomes a complete word.

Rājaputto-the king's son, **i.e.** the prince. [1] Set up the two base words as "**rāja+Putta**" [2] Then apply genitive singular "sa" after rāja and nominative singular "si" after putta> rāja+sa, **Putta+si.**
[3] (a) Change rāja together with the applied vibhatti "sa" into 
"**rañño**" by 135. (b) also change the nominative singular vibhatti "si" applied after putta into "o">putta+o. Then elide the preceding "a" by 83> putto> **rañño putto**.

[4] After this basic procedure is done, it becomes a complete viggaha sentence (ED) as "**Rañño putto**" which has a coherent and relevant meaning as "the king's son" [**rañño**-of king, **putto**-son]
[5] Then, as this ED sentence has coherent and relevant meanings to each other, it is declared and formally named as Chaṭṭhī-Tappurisa by Sutta 327.

[6] Then, elide all vibhattis and its concomitants (noun-caseendings "sa" and "si" along with their traces of morphological proce-

dure such as newly changed word-forms "rañño putto") by Sutta 317 > **rājaputta**. In addition, keep it as it is by Sutta 318.

[7] Then, this word "rājaputta" in transit is to be recognized as noun by means of Sutta 601.

[8] Apply a nominative singular "si" after rājaputta
> **rājaputta+si**
[9] Then, change "si" into "o" by Sutta 104> **Rājaputta+o**. [10] Apply elision procedure on the last "a" of the rājaputta by Sutta 83 (It becomes a complete word.) 

## Noun In Taddhita-Affix

Steps of the procedures: (1) Set up the word and applicable additional words such as "apacca" etc. 

as a base according to specific category of Taddhita.

(2) Apply a vibhatti after each base-word.

(3) Perform any necessary morphological procedure as shown in the nouns chapter till it becomes a complete ED with coherent and relevant meaning.

(4) Then, declare the meaning of ED and apply a relevant affix as necessary.

(5) Wipe out the applied vibhatti and all morphological traces of change till it returns to its initial crude-stage of the base.

(6) Then, recognize it as a noun and apply any necessary procedure as explained below until it becomes a complete word.

Vāsiṭṭho-Vasiṭṭha's son. [1] Set up the base as **Vasiṭṭha+apacca** [2] Apply genitive singular "sa" after vasiṭṭha> **Vasiṭṭha+sa**
and add one more "s" to the front of "sa" by means of Sutta 61 > **vasiṭṭhassa**
[3] Apply a nominative singular "si" after apacca>apacca+si.

Besides, change that "si" into "aṁ" by Sutta 219 > apacca+aṁ. Then, elide the preceding "a" by means of 83>
apaccaṁ. Thus, it becomes a complete ED sentence as "**Vasiṭṭhassa apaccaṁ**" which has relevant meaning.

[4] **Vasiṭṭhassa-**of someone named "vasiṭṭha", **apaccaṁ-**son. When this meaning signifying patronymic is implied by this ED, 

an affix "ṇa" is applied between two words by 344. It will then look like this> **vasiṭṭhassa+ṇa+apaccaṁ**.

[5] Then, by means of the word "tesaṁ" in Sutta 317, all the applied vibhatti, traces of morphological procedures as well as the word "apacca" are to be deleted> **vasiṭṭha+ṇa**.

[6] Elide the "ṇ" of the affix by means of Sutta 396>
vasiṭṭha+a.

[7] Keep it as it is by Sutta 318. [8] Then, by rule of Sutta 400, perform a vuddhi function on the front "a" at Vasiṭṭha> **Vāsiṭṭha+a**. Then, elide the second "a" by Sutta 83.

[9] Recognize this word "**vāsiṭṭha**" as a noun by Sutta 601 and apply a nominative "si" after it> **Vāsiṭṭha+si**
[10] Then, change that applied "si" into "o" by Sutta 104 >
Vāsiṭṭha+o.

[11] Apply elision procedure by Sutta 83 on the last vowel "a" of Vāsiṭṭha> **Vāsiṭṭh+o** (It thus becomes a complete word.) Note: Performing morphological procedures for Samāsa and Taddhita words require a strong and thorough knowledge and understanding of Nāma, Ākhyāta and Kita chapters. Thus, this branch of study of the structural morphology of Pāli words can broaden and enrich the grammatical insight of the student in many ways and lead to a more profound in-depth mastery of the language. 

# Kāraka And Sādhana

Sādhana means that by which a specific word suffixed with a Kita or an *uṇādi* affix is completed or brought to completion. It refers to various kinds of Kita and Uṇādi affixes. Through application of them, words are brought to completion as perfect words. The completed words carry the specific subtle meanings such as those grammatically defined terms of Kattu, Kamma and so on. The grammatical concept of Sādhana is originally based on the nature of affix being applied after the root and its relevant EDs. There are certain Suttas, such as *Bhāvakammesu ta (*556), Kattukaraṇapadesesu ca (548) and so on, which directly show a specific affix to be applied in a particular sense of Sādhana. Besides, the EDs of such words are also to be in concordant with relevant Sādhanas. For example, if the affix of the word is applied in the sense of Kattu sādhana, then the ED of that word has to be a Kattu Sādhana ED. For the ease and convenience of students, the name of specific Sādhana of EDs are shown in both Kita and Uṇādi chapters.

Though studying and understanding the Sādhanas and their general aspect and characteristics can help to develop a more thorough grammatical knowledge and skill, it is not essential for beginners. However, for the benefit of developing such a skill, all relevant information will be briefly explained. [Sādhiyate nipphādiyate anenā'ti sādhanaṁ. **sadha**-*nipphattiyaṁ-*to complete+yu]

## The Role Of Kāraka & Sādhana

Though Kāraka and Sādhana share somewhat similar implications, the role they can play in the grammar and actual sentence structure of the practical language application are quite different. (a) The six Kārakas in individually assigned case-endings as per the relevant Suttas in the Kāraka chapter, can definitely play their own specific roles such as the subject (for Kattukāraka) or the object (for Kamma-kāraka) and so forth.

(b) On other hand, most of the Sādhanas do not have this kind of significant role. However, out of seven Sādhanas, Kattu, Kamma and Bhāva, have some significant role in affecting the voice of a verb and **the structure of a sentence.**
For example, a Kattu-affixed word may affect the voice of sentence to be an active voice. Kamma-affixed word and Bhāva-affixed words will affect as passive voice and impersonal voices respectively. Shown below are some sample sentences structured with such words as examples.

Example sentence of Kattu-Sādhana-affixed words. Note: The verbs with Kattu-sādhana affix are shown underlined.

(1) Dānaṁ Dinno devadatto [dā+ta] (Sutta 626, Kaccāyana text, Uṇādi chapter) Devadatta gave alms. (Active voice) 
(2) Kumaro antepuraṁ gato [gamu+ta] (Mahāpadāna Sutta, Mahāvagga Pāli) The prince went into the palace. (Active voice) 
(3) So bhagavā sayam'pi cattāri saccāni Buddho [Budha+ta]
(Cūla-Saccaka Sutta commentary, Mūlapaṇṇāsa Pāli texts) That glorious Buddha knew four truths by himself too. (Active voice) 
Example sentence **of Kamma-sādhana affixed words**
Note: The verbs with Kamma-sādhana affix are shown underlined.

(1) Buddhena dhammo desito [disa+ta] The Dhamma is taught by Buddha. (Passive voice) 
(2) Bhotabbo odano bhavatā [bhuja+tabba] (Sutta 625, Uṇādi chapter, Kaccāyana text) The rice is to be eaten by your honorable. (Passive voice) Example sentence of Bhāva-sādhana affixed word. Note: The verbs with Bhāva-sādhana affix are shown underlined.

(1) Tassa Gītaṁ [ge+ta] (Sutta 556, Kita chapter) Of that person (**i.e.**
His) singing, His singing.

(2) Sayitabbaṁ bhavatā [si+tabba] (Sutta 625, Uṇādi chapter) 
Eating by your honorable. (Impersonal voice) 

## 837 General Aspects Of Sādhana.

Keep in mind that the remaining four Sādhanas, namely Karaṇa, Sampadāna, Apādāna and Adhikaraṇa, do not have any significant role except that of an ordinary noun in a sentence. The meaning of words affixed in each of the seven Sādhanas have their own subtle meanings which are clearly and simply translated below. See an ordinary translation and then a bit detailed explanatory note shown in parenthesis which reflect their respective Sādhana and the ED in Pāli. In order to understand a Sādhana and relevant ED of each Sādhana, a student needs to know the sense of affix and the general structural aspect of each ED which are distinctive from each other. Please read notes carefully which explains general aspects of the EDs of each Sādhana. As a matter of fact, it requires a very firm foundation of thorough study and grammatical knowledge to understand all aspects of Sādhana and EDs. 1. **[Kattu]** Nāyako-the leader (who leads) (Sutta 527) 
[ED in Pāli] Netī'ti Nāyako. [neti+iti]
Note: Here, Kattu-sādhana is signified by means of the Ākhyāta verb "neti" which in itself is an active-voice verb in Kattu-sense. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason (*Vacana-hetu*).

2. **[Kamma]** Kammaṁ-work (which is being done) (531) 
[ED in Pāli] Karīyate tan'ti Kammaṁ. [karīyate taṁ+it]
Note: Here, Kamma-sādhana is signified by means of the Ākhyāta verb 
"Karīyate" which in itself is a passive voice verb with the affix "ya" in Kamma-sense. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason.

3. **[Bhāva]** Cāgo-generosity (act of giving, sharing) (529) [ED 
in Pāli] Cajate, Cajanaṁ vā Cāgo (vā indicates another possible ED) Note: Here, Bhāva-sādhana is signified by means of twin verbs of two applicable EDs, the first "Cajate" being an Ākhyāta verb in Bhāva voice and the second Kita word "Cajanaṁ" in Bhāva affix "yu". Here, the verbs which in themselves are expressive of Bhāva-sense. Also note that there is no "iti" at all. This is the only Sādhana where there is no 
"iti" required in its ED.

4. **[Karaṇa]** Vinayo-the discipline (by which one is trained) 
(527) [ED in Pāli] Vineti etenā'ti Vinayo. [etena+iti]
Note: Here, Karaṇa-sādhana is signified by means of a Sabbanāmanoun word "eta" in instrumental case which by itself is a Karaṇa. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason.

5. **[Sampadāna]** Dānīyo-the recipient monk (to which alms should be given) [ED in Pāli] Databbo Assā'ti Dānīyo.

 [assa+iti]
Note: Here, Sampadāna-sādhana is signified by means of the Sabbanāma word "Ta" in dative case which by itself is a Sampadāna. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason.

6. **[Apādāna]** Bhemo-the fearsome object (from which people fear) (627) [ED in Pāli] Bhāyanti etasmā'ti Bhemo. [etasmā+iti]
Note: Here, Apādāna-sādhana is signified by means of Sabbanāma noun "eta" in ablative case which by itself is an Apādāna. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason.

7. **[Adhikaraṇa]** Ṭhānaṁ-the place (where people stand) 
(548) [ED in Pāli] Tiṭṭhanti Tasmin'ti Ṭhānaṁ [tasmiṁ+iti]
Note: Here, Adhikaraṇa-sādhana is signified by means of Sabbanāma noun "ta" in locative case which by itself is an Adhikaraṇa also called Padesa or Okāsa. Also note the word "iti" is included to indicate the reason.

By taking a careful look at the above explanation, it is hoped that the students will clearly understand how Kāraka and Sādhana play their inherent parts in the structure of Pāli words and its sentences.

# The List Of Similar Suttas Found In Pāṇinī & Kaccāyana.

Sanskrit Sutta (SS) and Kaccāyana Sutta (KS) are shown here alongside in transliterated Romanized characters to show different or similar physical structure of each Sutta found in both grammatical texts. Numbers after Suttas indicate the book, chapter and serial sequence of each respectively. Being similar does not necessarily mean to be identical in terms of function and physical structure. Most Suttas, except a few, have only partial similarity and affinity in terms of the implied function, physical structure of wording and sentence make-up. The transliterated words of each Sutta will attest to the fact that Kaccāyana's work can not be unilaterally averred as a complete copy of its cousin grammars, but a work borne out of shared linguistics which have deeply-rooted ancestry in the ancient Indo-Aryan civilization. 

59There are 3925 or 3996 Suttas in Pāṇinī while Kaccāyana comprises only 673 or 675 if two more Suttas from earlier versions are included. The ratio and margin of similarity is not much substantial in relation to the amount of Suttas in the Sanskrit texts as it was assumed by some scholars.

# Gender Classification

Knowing and determining the gender of a specific Pāli word and being able to use it properly is one important characteristic of a true Pāli scholar. It is a very delicate skill which can be slowly developed through a thorough understanding of the structural dynamic of a word and long-term study of the language. In this appendix, the gender of compounds, **taddhita-affixes** and **kitasuffixes** are shown being classified into the specific gender groups. Please note that **this is not a definitive guide** as there are two kinds of words, the ones having a fixed gender and those having variable genders. If a word is shown as being of variable gender, it means that the word may become either feminine or neuter depending on its contextual meaning and usage though it is shown as being masculine. This process used to occur when either used contextually or as an adjective which modifies another word of either neuter or feminine meaning despite it is originally specified as masculine. **Note:** The gender of most of the ordinary nouns are not shown here as it is to be explained in a separate book.

The Gender of Taddhita-affixes The possible and applicable gender of words suffixed with each specific taddhita-affix are shown in the tables below. If a certain taddhita-affix is shown as being variable gender, it will be affixed with an additional suffix such as ā or ī or inī in order to signify the feminine gender. In some cases where contextually used as an adjective or adverb, the gender tends to be variable. This used to occur in the words affixed with non-patronymic affixes. For masculine and neuter genders, one affix is quite a normative pattern along with the necessary morphological derivative of the applicable case-ending.

## Kita Affixes & Gender

The majority of kita-affixes, except quite a few, do not have a fixed gender. Even though it is shown as being a specific gender, it can be of variable gender in some cases. With the exception of those suffixed with verbal affixes, any word affixed with other non-verbal kita-affix may belong to a specific gender. Therefore, the applicable and likely gender of the words suffixed with a specific kita-affix are shown in three tables; (a) one for the verbal affixes, (b) one for the gerund affixes and (c) one for the affixes which help form to become certain individual noun words. The majority of Uṇādi-affixes, except some verbal affixes, are used mainly in the formation of individual nouns of varying genders. Therefore, it is not shown here separately as it is assumed to be easily inferable for any keen student of Pāli.

# Kaccāyana Dhātvā'Vali The Index Of Roots In Kaccāyana Text

Note: The roots are like the basic building blocks of various Pāli words. One can multiply various verb-forms and nouns by using different verb-terminations and applicable affixes. Therefore, it is quite important to have some basic knowledge of the roots. Below is an alphabetical order of the roots in the list. (a) The root called *dhātu* is shown in bold. (b) Its meaning called *Dhātvattha-pavedanā* is shown in italicized Pāli followed by English. 

(c) The Sutta numbers where example word of the root are found, are shown alongside. [**dhātvattha-dhātu**-the root+ **attha**meaning+**pavedanā**-letting it be known, **i.e.** declaration.]
Usually, *dhātvatthapavedanā* is a kita-affixed noun in locative singular case-ending which may be affixed with one of **yu, ṇa, a** or ti affixes. (1) When it is affixed in "yu", it will end in "**ane, aṇe, āne,** 
āṇe". e.g. Kathane, saraṇe, dāne, ñ**āṇe .**
(2) When affixed in ṇa or a, it will end in just an "e" with or without a *vuddhi* function in the word. e.g. Pāke, Naye.

(3) When affixed in "ti", it will be just plain "ti" ending in **yaṁ** 
or **mhi.** e.g. gatiyaṁ, gatimhi. (yaṁ and mhi are derivative morpheme of locative singular "smiṁ". Refer to Sutta 216, 99) 
A *dhātvatthapavedanā* usually declares the meaning of the root as **an action** (*kriya'ttha*) such as "to go, to speak" and so on. But in some rare instances, there are a few roots which may mean **the substance** (*dabba'ttha*) rather than being an action. e.g., **palla**-*ninnathāne*-in being low-lying area. Please note that generally some roots may have one single meaning but there are roots with more than one meaning. Some of the roots may even change their original meaning in many distinctive ways when prefixed with various *upasagga* particles. 

Also note that any root having the meaning of "**gati**-to move, to go" may even mean "to know, to be or to reach" which is a bit like English verb "get" which has a rich variety of meanings in various contextual usages. All of the roots are drawn from Ākhyāta, Kita and Uṇādi chapters totaling 273.
