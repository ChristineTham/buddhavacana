Pali grammatical literature The Pali expression **Pali—bhasa** means "the language 
(bhasa) of the texts for recitation (Pali)". Those texts belong to the earliest stratum of Buddhist scriptures as they *are* preserved by the Theravada Buddhists. They *are* collectively referred to as the Tipitaka (the Pali Canon) in that tradition, and they are supposed to be **Buddha-vacana** (the word of the Buddha). Therefore Pali is the language of the earliest Buddhist scriptures as preserved in a Buddhist tradition and also has been used as spoken language and a means of communication. According to the tradition Pali also is known as Magadhi (the language of Magadha). Theravada Buddhists have produced a number of Pali grammatical texts for the study of their Canon. The grammatical literature of the Pali starts 
- - 2 -
from Mahakaccayana's **Niruttipitaka, Yamakamahathera'**s 3 - 4 -
Cu11 a m r u t t i **, Bodhisatta —vyakarana** and **Sabbagunakara** -

vyakarana. Unfortunately these grammatical texts are now lost, but references to them occurring in the Saddaniti and the **Padasadhana-tika** indicate that they must have been in existence during the time of Aggavamsa, the author of the **Saddaniti,** who belongs to the 12th century A.D. and **Rahula,** the author of the Padasadhana-tika, who belongs to the 15th century A.D. 

Perhaps they might have quoted them from some fragments or from some other sources without acknowledging the sources. It is said that **Buddhaghosa,** the greatest commentator of Pali literature refers to the lost Pali grammatical texts in his works indirectly. K.R. **Norman** 
observes: "The grammatical terminology used by Buddhaghosa and Dhammapala indicates that there was already before their time a fixed grammatical system, although there is not enough evidence to decide whether they were referring to an actual grammar, now lost". 

H. Scharfe says: "It is possible that Buddhaghosa (5th century A.D.) , the Buddhist commentator of Pali texts, refers to a lost Pali grammar when he discusses grammatical questions". The lost Pali grammar mentioned by K.R. **^4o^man** and **H. Scharfe** is the same as 5. "Sabbagunakaramahathero 'siddhakkamadadayo vannakkhara titalisa'ti aha" **ibid.,** 3S, 12—13, see also Sadd Bi Nldanakatha (p. cha); Pay *pre,* **p.2.**

Niruttipitaka, Cul1 anirutti, Bodhisatta-vyakarana and Sabbagunakara—vyakarana or not; whether there is a fullfledged system of Pali grammar before Kaccayana or not, 8 these problems are still disputed, because we don't have enough evidences to arrive at the exact conclusion. 

However the first Pali grammar, we have, is Kaccayanavyakarana which exists and is considered as the oldest Pali grammar. 

Vyakarana is one of the important art among IS 
9 arts and it is also one of the six Vedanga—s (auxiliary Vedic sciences). Among Vedanga-s **Vyakarana** is the most important and beneficial **aiiga** for the study of Veda —s and other sciences. 11 This word is derived as: vi+a+ 
12 kara+yu suffix = **vyakaranam.** It is analysed asi 8. Cf. **SPS** I Introd., p. 34. 9- "attharasa mahasippani: suti suramati vyakaranam chandoviciti nirutti jotisattham sikkha mokkhananam kiriyavidhi dhanubbedo hatthisikkha kamatantam assa1akkhanam puranam itihaso niti takko vejjakam" **Sadd**

PED gives three meanings of it as: (1) answer. explanation, exposition (2) grammar (3) prediction 15 Moreover V/ayyakarana belongs to the Navangasatthusasana 
(the master's nine—fold teaching) and it indicates the entire Abidhamma, sutta—s without verses and the other Buddha—vacana-s which are not included in the other 8 17 Anga—s (divisions) It a 1 so means answer, explanation, exposition; one who is an expert in 18 explanation or answer, a grammarian". However, in the canonical literature we find that the term nirutti is used to denote "explanation of words, grammatical analysis, etymological interpretation, pronunciation.

the six Vedanga—s 20 The term nirutti is used in close relation to grammar and its importance is emphasised in Dhammapada as: 
"vitatanho anadano niruttipadakovido akkharanam sannipatam janna pubbaparani ca sa ve antimasariro mahapanno mahapuriso ti vuccati". 

However, the term **Vyakarana** does not occur to refer directly to the grammatical rules of the language used by the Buddha or by his disciples. This does not indicate in any way that the language used by the Buddha or His disciples did not follow any grammar or 22 -
grammatical rules. It seems that the term **Vyakarana** in the canonical literature may refer to some grammatical texts existing during that time. As H.O. **Find** observes: 
"It is not known when and under what circumstances a distinct Buddhist grammatical literature devoted to the description of the language of the Pali canon originated. It is reasonable to assume that, throughout the development of the Buddhist tradition, basic knowledge of the morphology and vocabulary of the canonical language was handed down in some form or another, even though it may never have been based upon any distinct grammatical tradition. The Niddesa, with its strings of glosses and morphological substitute 1. **Dhp** see also HPL II p.631. 

forms may be considered an early instance of the level of sophistication of such basic knowledge". 

Moreover, the references to the grammar of language started from the time of **Buddhaghosa** onwards. 

In several instances, he clearly refers his readers to grammar (**saddasattha**) or grammarians (**sadda1akkhanavidu,** 
saddavidu, akkharacinta) for information about the point 24 of view of grammar. B.C. **Law,** however, observes: "We may venture to suggest that there was no Pali book of Pali grammar in existence till the time of the three great Pali commentators, Buddhadatta Buddhaghosa and 
- 25 Dhammapala". 

Linguistical studies of Pali and Sanskrit may prove to be complimentary to each other. **W. Subhuti** remarks: "Those who know these two languages (Sanskrit and Pali) are aware of the fact, that the study of Sanskrit grammar, to some extent at least, is indispensably necessary before one can acquire a 26 thorough knowledge of Pali grammar". However, the development of Pali grammatical literature has been furthered in many countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. Grammarians therein have produced many texts. 

Especially Myanmar is well-known in the field of Pali grammar. Most of Pali grammatical texts are available in the Burmese script. R. **Gombrich** observes: ".... for the practical purpose of describing the language, then, the development of Pali is generally considered to end 27 with the Burmese grammarians". 

Generally the Pali grammars *Are* classified under three schools, namely, (1) **Kaccayana—vyakarana** (2) 
Moggga11ana-vyakarana (3) **Saddaniti.** According to Burmese tradition there are four schools by adding the Saddasangaha as the fourth one. However **Saddasangaha** is well—known in Myanmar and hardly known in other countries like Sri Lanka and Thailand as far as the Pali study is concerned. As a proper introduction to the present attempt, let us have, in the following pages, an outline of the schools of Pali *grammsir.* 
Saddasangaha: This text has its own sutta—s, vutti and udaharana—s. It **was** composed during the reign 28 of the king **Min-don-min** (1852-1877 A.D.) by the learned **YD ubholai** of Mandalay in Myanmar. Due to the limited number of scholars who studied it, it is still 29 in manuscript form.

Malala&ekera (PLC p. 185) H. Scharf (GE p. 194) K.R. Norman (PL p.116) follow either Bode or **Geiger. E.G.** 
Kahrs (ES p. 2 fn. 2) quotes some sources and comments: 
"M.C. Duroiselle (1905: 147, note 1) informs us that Forchhammer gives the year as 1156 but claims that Aggavamsa himself gives the date as 1154. Recently Tin Lwin (1991 ?) has questioned this, claiming that nowhere in the **Saddaniti** is given its dates and that the introductory gathas *are* missing in all manuscripts available to us (p. 124) . He concludes, somewhat confusingly, that the **Saddaniti** should be placed towards the end of the reign of Cansu II (1173-1210) or during the first half of the thirteenth century (p. 

126) . Intriguing though it is, this claim would require a more detailed argumentation to be conclusive". G.E. 

Fryer (NPK p. 124) gives the probable date as 1279 A.D. 

of Moggallana could have been hardly known to him 
(AggavamBa); it was composed probably after the Saddaniti". However, before we accept the statement of Geiger we have to compare **Moggallana** and **Saddaniti** 
throughout. According to **Pitakat- eamuin^, Aggavamsa** 
composed his work during the reign of king Kya—cva of 36 Pagan dynasty (Burmese Era - 596-612= 1234-1250 A.D.) . 

It seems probable, because the king also was a grammarian; he himself composed two Pali grammars, namely, the **Saddabindu** and **Paramatthabindhu**. During this time Pali grammar was a popular subject of study even among women. At the king's court there were grammarians too. The works produced under his patronage were chiefly grammatical. The **Saddaniti,** as pointed out by **M.H. Bode,** was "the first return-gift of Burma to Ceylon". She further says: "A few years after its completion the thera ('elder') Uttarajiva left Pagan and crossed the sea to visit the celebrated Mahavihara taking with him a copy of the Saddaniti, which was received with enthusiastic admiration, and declared superior to any work of the kind written by Sinhalese 3Q scholars". This text is still regarded as a classic 3 5. **PLL** p. 55.

38. Ibid., p. 17, see also **PLC** p. 185, cf. **PLL** p. 55 in Myanmar. The work consists of 28 chapters, the first nineteen *Are* called **liahasaddan i t i** and the last nine *are* called **Cu11asaddaniti**. It has three main parts: the **Padamala** (the chapters **1-14),** the **Dhatumala** 
(the chapters 15-19); the **Suttamala** (the chapters 20 -
28) . **Aggavamsa** largely follows Kaccayana and improves upon the latter. From the point of view of contents it is hardly justifiable to separate the **Saddaniti** from the school of Kaccayana. He makes use of the Sanskrit grammars such as those of **Panini,** etc. It is said that it was based on the writing of the teachers as well as 41 canonical material. There is a commentary on it

called the **Saddaniti-tika** composed by **Pannasami** of 42 - 43 Mandalay. M.H. Bode gives the **Sasanavamsa** as the source for this, and states: "At the request of 'many of

Another grammatical work **Mogga11 ana —vyakarana** is also called **Sadda1akkhana**. This grammatical text belongs to a new school of Pali grammar and is considered as the up—to—date treatise on Pali grammar. 

- 4 5 - 
The author was **Moggallana** a disciple of **Mahakassapa** 
of Udumbaragiri, who lived in the **Thuparama Vihara** at Anuradhapura and wrote his work during the reign of Parakkamabahu I (1153-1186 A.D.) . The king had purged the **Sangha** of all heretical bhikkhu-s, the event which took place in 1165 A.D. Therefore it is most probable that he had completed his work at least a few years after 1165 A.D.^^ 
Sadda1akkhana consists of six chapters, namely, 
(1) terminology and euphonic combination (2) declension and syntax (3) compound and feminine terminations (4) 
nominal derivatives (5) verbal derivatives (6) verb or 4 4. **PLB** p. 93 on which E.G. **Kahrs** (ES p. 3 fn . 1 ) 
remarkss "Nowhere else have I seen any reference to such a commentary and, in fact, I doubt whether such a work

ever existed since Pannasami wrote as late as the latter half of the 19th century. It seems rather unlikely that so late a work should have vanished without trace".

48 conjugation. There are several points of difference between the Hoggallana and Kaccayana; e.g. Moggallana says that there are forty three sounds not forty—one as given in Kaccayana and ten vowels (adding short e and o) not eight as given in Kaccayana etc. It's arrangement and grouping of the rules as **well** as terminology *Are* different from that of Kaccayana. In his work, besides the older Pali grammar, he made use of the Panini, Katantra and especially **Candragomin** and quoted numerous examples from **Tipitaka** to support his 49 ~ _ 
argument. He also wrote the **Pancika** or commentary on his own vutti called the **Mogga11 ana —paneika** or the 
_ •»• _ 5o vutti—**vannana—pancika**. He, therefore, unlike other grammarians, wrote not only the sutta-s (rules) but also the vutti (explanations) and the Pancika 
(comments) to elucidate his system. 

## Moggallana Tradition

There are several commentaries on **Sadda1akkhana**. 

They are:— 
(1) **Padasadhana:** This is the first subsidiary work written on the Moggallana grammar. It forms an abridged version of Moggallana grammar. According to De **Zoysa,** 
the relation between the **Padasadhana** and **Moggallana** is 4 8. DSC pp. 184-185, PLC p. 187, GE p. 195, **HOP** p.95.

of

Sandhi
(euphonic  combination) (3)  Nāma  (nouns) 
( 4 )
Ekattha   (compounds)   (5)   Itthi-paccaya 
(feminine suffixes)  (6) Nādayo or Taddhita (nominal derivatives)
Tabbādaya or Kita (verbal derivatives) (8)  Tyādayo
( 7 )
(verbs).53 There  is  a tikā on   Padasādhana   called  
the Buddhippakasini.  It is also called the Padasadhana-tika Padasādhana-vaṇṇanā which was written  in  1472 or the Vacissara Sangharājā of Sri Lanka.54 However,in A.D. by Sinhalese  his  name is often spelt  as  Totagamuve  Sri Rāhula.55
(2) Payogasiddhi:  This is considered to be one of best and comprehensive Pāli commentary  written  on the Moggallāna grammar.  It has been said that the  relation between the Payogasiddhi and Moggallāna-vyākaraṇa is the that of  the  Rūpasiddhi  and the Kaccāyanass as vyākaraṇa.

(3) **Sambandhacinta**: This also is based on the Mogga11ana-vyakarana. It was composed by **Sangharakkhita** 
of Sri Lanka. This text probably belongs to the twelfth century. It deals with the relation of the Pali verb and its use in syntax and also presents a description of the six karaka—s (**kammakaraka,** 
kattukaraka, karanakaraka, sampadanakaraka, apadanakaraka and **adharakaraka**) used with the verb in a sentence. It may be noted here that according to **W.**

gives the probable date of **Abhaya** as 1227 A.D. 

(4) **Susaddasiddhi**: This was a subsidiary work on the **Moggal1ana-vyakarana**. It was written by Sangharakkhita of Sri Lanka. This work is not available at present. The Karakapupphamanjari of eighteenth century refers to it. According to G.P. Ma1 a 1asekera, the **Susaddasiddhi** or the Saratthavi1**asini** 
was a tika on the MoggaI 1 ana —**panei**ka. However, it has been said that **Sangharakkhita** wrote three books in Pali grammar belonging to the Moggallana tradition, namely, (1) the **Saratthavi1asini** on the **Moggallana—**

or pancikā-pradīpaya:   This is a  commentary  on the the Moggallana-pancika.  It was written partly in  Sinhalese and partly in Pāli, and it is one of the most comprehensive works on Pali grammar extant in Sri  Lanka.

It was composed in 1457 A.D. by Totagamuve Sri Rahula.71 consists of six chapters, namely,  (1)

Place of Kaccayana—vyakaran a Kaccayana—vyakarana belongs to the oldes t school of Pali grammatical tradition . It is so called , 
because it owes its origin to the teacher Kaccayan a or liahakaccayana. It is called variousl y as : Kaccayan **a —** 
vyakarana , Kaccayana-pakarana **, Kaccayana-yoga** , 
Kaccayana-gandha , Susandhi-kappa , Kaccayanamu1appakaran a 7 4 **. Ibid., p.** 106 fn. 5. 

or **Mu1akaccayanappakarana**. Let ui consider the significance of these titles: 
(1) **Kaccayana—pakarana:** The **word Kaccayana** is used here as a mark of honour to its author. The word pakarana means "performance, undertaking, paragraph (of the **law),** occasion, exposition, arrangement, literary 7Q work, composition, book". If it is used as the title, it indicates literary work, composition or book e.g. 

Abhidhamma—pakarana, Kathavatthu—pakarana, Netti79 -
pakarana. Therefore the meaning would be: "Kaccayana's composition" or "the book on Kaccayana". 

(2) **Kaccayana—vyakarana** : The word **Vyakarana** used SO here means grammar. Therefore this title means: 
"Kaccayana's grammar" or "the grammar written by Kaccayana" . *Q 1* 
(3) **Kaccayana—yoga :** The **word Yoga** here means aphor isms 82 Therefore this title means 7 8. **PED** s.v. pakarana.

"Kaccayano kato yogo Sanghanandi pavuttika tika Vimalabodhi ca Brahmaputto ca karaka". 

"Kaccayana'5 aphorismB " or "aphorism writte n by Kaccayana" . 

(4) Kaccayana—gandha : The word s **gandha** and **ganth** a are synonym s in Pali . " This is one of the six book s 84 ascribed to Mahakaccayana . It probably refers to the Q 5 Kaccayana-vyakarana . The title **Kaccayana-gandh** a may be translated as : "the Kaccayana' s text" or "the text writte n by Kaccayana". 

(5) **Susandhi - kappa:** Thi s title occur s in the introductory verses of the **Kaccayana-vyakarana** . It is so called because the text starts with the **Sandhi—kapp** a as its first chapter to give much emphasi s on the importanc e of the rules of sandhi . Thus : su + sandhi + 
kappa = Susandhikappa (su means well , nice , **sandhi** mean s joint , accord, agreement , combinatio n etc. ; **kappa** mean s 86 time , part , chapter etc . Here it stand s for chapter) . 

T he meaning would be : "the chapter on sandhi" . If the title **Susandhi—kappa** stands for the chapter on the 8 3 . Cf . **Note I. 1** pp. 96-7 .

sandhi only, then it does not convey the purpose of the author, because sandhi is not enough in understanding the meaning of **Buddha-vacana**. Bhikkhu **Satyapala** rightly observes: "Thus, it seems, the term, **Susandhikappa** here does not only refer to the contents of the **Sandhikappa,** 
but it refers to the contents of all the chapters Q7 including those of the **Sandhikappa".** The title is QQ also spelt as **Sandhi—kappa.** 
(6) Kaccayana—mu1appakarana or **Mu1akaccayana—pakarana**: 
The word **mula** means "root, foot, bottom, ground for, reason, cause, condition, origin, source, foundation, beginning, base". 

The word here stands for beginning or base. The book is so called, because it was the beginning or basic text to enter into Pali study. It was a manual, belonging to the compulsory subjects for monks and novices in the ancient times. They had to master it as a basic text. 

Let us now turn to the discussion about the authorship of the present grammar. First, reference may be made to the view that the author was Mahakaccayana , a disciple of Lord Buddha. He was born at Ujjeni in the 8 7. Kn I Introd., p. 82.

family of the chaplain of king Candappajjota, and was called Kaccayana both because of his golden complexion and because Kaccayana was the name of his gotta. He studied the Veda-s, and on the death of his father, succeeded him as chaplain. With seven others he visited the Buddha, at the request of Candappaj**jota**, to invite him to come to Ujjeni. Kaccayana and his friends listened to the Buddha's sermon, and having attained arantaship, joined the order. He then conveyed the king's invitation to the Buddha, who pointed out that it would now suffice if Kaccayana himself returned to Ujjeni. Kaccayana accordingly set out for Ujjeni with his seven companions. After having made the king devoted (to the Buddha) and having duly established the 
- - 91 Sasana in Avanti, he returned once more to the Buddha. 9 1.

(contd. to the next page) 
According to the **Apadana**, Kaccayana's father was called **Tiritivaccha** (or **Tidivavaccha**) and his mother 
- 92 **Candapaduma**. And he was one of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha. He is considered as the chief among the expounders of the brief sayings of the 93 - 
Buddha. According to the tradition **Kaccayana** not only composed the Pali grammar bearing his name but also the **Netti-pakarana** and the **petakopadesa**. It is probable that these works **were** the compilations of a - - 94 school which traced its descent to Mahakaccayana.

According to **Gandhavainsa** , he composed six books, namely, (1) **Kaccayana-gandha** (2) **Mahanirutti-gandha** (3) 
Cul aniriitti-gandha (4) Netti-gandha (5) Petakopadesa 
- <75 _ - 
(6) Vannaniti—gandha. Reference to Mahakaccayana who composed the **Kaccayana—vyakarana** occurs first in the Apadana—atthakatha. Later, the commentators belonging to the Kaccayana tradition e.g. **Vima1abuddhi**, the author 
- - 97 of the **Nyasapatha,** and **Buddhappiya,** the author of the 
_ _ —9Q 
Rupasiddhi-tika have followed that passage. 

Further, interesting stories occur in the **Suttaniddesa** 
and the **Kaccayana—vannana**. In the former we have the following story as followsi- "A certain aged monk having taken kammatthana (subject of meditation) from the 95. See fn. 83.

Blessed One (and) sitting at the root of a **Sala** tree on the bank of the lake **Anotatta** meditated on the kammatthana, repeating the word **udaya - vaya**. Observing a crane **(baka)** moving on the water **(udaka)**, he began to utter the words **udaka—baka.** The Blessed One, sent for the old monk, and uttered the phrase "Attho akkharas— 
•%\# *vannato (the meaning is known by the sound)". They say that the Elder Kaccayana having perceived the Blessed One's intention, placed the phrase "Attho akkharasa— •V -V 
nnato" as the first of his aphorisms, (and later on) 
composed this text. It is also said that the above 99 phrase was composed by the Elder Kaccayana himself". 

Another version of the story goes as follows:— "Two Brahmins, **Yama** and **Uppala,** having learned the kammatthana repeating the words **khaya—vaya** went away (and) 
meditated on (the kammatthana) repeating **khaya—vaya** on the banks of a river. One of them saw a crane 9 9.

proceeding to catch a fish in the water, and began muttering **udaka—bako** (water-crane). The other, seeing a cloth in a pot began muttering **ghata—pato.** At this time the Blessed One having issued light declared the phrase 
'V "V 
'Attho akkharasannato". Thus the aphorism was declared by the Blessed One. Having known this, Mahakaceayana with the Blessed One's permission proceeded to the Himalaya-s. Reclining in the **Manosila** region with hi« 
head towards the South, and turning his face to the East he composed the **Kaccayana—pakarana** consisting of 
'*-'*'- lOO 
the phrase "Attho akkharasannato' etc. It is also held that the whole work (sutta—s, vutti and udaharanas) was composed by one and the same person i.e. MahalOO.

(2) Let us turn to another **view** about the authorship. According to it, the **Kaccayana—vyakarana** 
was composed by three authors and the commentary by still another. The aphorisms were composed by Kaccayana, the vutti by **Sanghanandi,** the payoga by Brahmadatta and the **Nyasa by Vima1abuddhi**. This information occurs in the Kaccayanabheda—abhinava— 
- - 102 - -
tika. It is also said that Mahakaccayana is identical with **Sanghanandi. "" J. D'Alwis** rejects this view and remarks: "It will be observed, that the writer's statement, that Sanghanandi was identical with Mahakache hayana is not borne out by the authority quoted. From the distinct mention of different names for the authors of different parts, viz., the Grammar, its supplements, its notes, and its principal comment, lOi. **IKP** Introd., p. XXII, **DSC** p. 47 , **Nam** pre. p. 12. 102. See fn. 82. **PLC** p.ISO, **DPPN I** p. 479 and **HOP** p. 68 ascribe the verse to the Kaccayanabheda of Mahayasa. S.C. Vidyabhusana (KB Introd., p. XXVI) remarks : "I am inclined to believe that the entire work was written by Katyayana (Kaccayana) himself. At any rate the sutta etc. were written simultaneously". 

103. "imina suttani Mahakacc ay anenca katani, vutti ca Sanghanandisank hatena Mahakaccayanena kata; payogo Brahmadattena kato" **Kaccayanabheda - tika** quoted from **IKP** 
p. i04, see also **DSC** p. 52, **NPK** p. 126, **PLC** p. ISO. 

the Nyasa; it would seem that Sanghanandi (also called Sankhanandi) was a person different from Mahakachcha104 yana". B.P. **Malalasekera** shares the view with him and remarks: "From distinct mention of different names for the authors of the different parts, it would seem that Sanghanandi was different from Kaccayana. In the tika to his work, written by Mahayasa himself, he tries to justify the tradition that both rules and supplements were written by Kaccayana, on the hypothesis that Kacca105 yana may also have been called Sanghanandi". It is quite possible that Elder Mahakaccayana himself who was the head of a school at Avanti compiled a set of grammatical rules in the language in which the Canon was handed down and later on they were developed apparently in India, probably by members **(Sanghanandi, Brahmadatta,** 
and lastly by **Vima1abuddhi**) of the Avanti school. 

(3) According to the third view about authorship, the **Kaccayana—vyakarana** was not composed by Mahakaccayana, a disciple of Lord Buddha, but it was composed by later Kaccayana who was either Sri Lankan or a South 104. **Ibid.,** p. 105 and **DSC** p. 53. 

105. **PLC** p. 180; He also assumes that **Mahayasa** also composed the **Kaccayanabheda— (abhinava) tika.** However, as the evidences show, he composed only the Kaccayanasara-tika.

(contd. from the previous page) 
assumes that **Katyayana** (belonging to **Katantra)** and Kaccayana are the same person and so he remarks: 
"Katyayana who added the chapter on **Krt** and **Unadi** to the **Katantra** grammar of **Sarvavarman** is, I believe, the same person who compiled the first Pali grammar. It is, however, doubtful whether he is the same **Katyayana who** 
wrote **varttika** on the Sanskrit grammar of Panini". Cf. 

IP p. 145. As J. D'Alwis (IKP Introd., p. XXXVIII) 
remarks: "Identity of names does not prove identity of persons".

(2) The **Mogg«llan«** and the **Saddaniti** rejected some rules of Kaccayana not keeping with the **Buddha—vacana** e.g. 

112. The close connection between Kaccayana's Pali grammar and the **Katantra** was noticed first by J. **D'Alwis** 
and **E Kuhn** 'Kaccayanappakaranae specimen' pp- 19—21 quoted in **ASG** p. 9 fn. 1. CJ- D'Alwis at **IKP** Introd., p. 

XL, regrettably says that he is not able to procure a copy of the **Katantra** for the purpose of comparison, but in **DSC** pp. 61-66 he had translated E. **Kuhn**'s work as mentioned above]. In it E. **Kuhn** not only compared the Kaccayana and the **Katantra** but also **Panini** and **Kacca—** 
yana. A.C. Burnell (ASG pp. 9-10) compares the arrangement of the **Kaccayana** and the **Katantra. He** 
(ibid., p. 16) is of the opinion that both Kaccayana and the author of the **Katantra** have mostly taken their technical terms and many of their sutta—s from the Aindra grammar. M.E. **Senart** also in his work, on which the present attempt is based, gives some comparisons between **Panini, Katantra** and **Kaccayana** occasionally. 

There is a very interesting article by L.Renou entitled 
"Kaccayana et le Katantra" in Etudes vediques et panini^ennes 3, Paris, 1957, pp. 127-33. In it he compared terminology and aphorisms of the **Kaccayana,** the Katantra, Astadhyayi and other grammatical Sanskrit te>sts. For the similar comparison see also **NPK** pp. 120121, **Mmd** Introd., p. X, PLC p. 183, **PLL** p. 37, **HPL II** 
p. 635, IP p. 145, GE p. 194, PL p. 163. 

2.1. According to Kaccayana there *Are* 41 sounds 113 consisting of 33 consonants and 8 vowels. But Moggallana disagrees with him and says that there *eire* 43 sounds consisting of 33 consonants and lO vowels A ^ 11 4 including short e and o e.g. **seyyo** and **sotthi**. 

Moggallana has criticized Kaccayana's view. 

2.2. With reference to Kaccayana's aphorism 'Tayo n'eva ca sabbanamehi' Moggallana states that there substitutions do take place 118 117 and disagrees with Kaccayana With reference to Kaccayana's aphorism "Tad

(4) The traditionalists  quote  the Apadāna-aṭṭhakathā, Nyāsapāṭha and  Rūpasiddhi-ṭīkā as  the  sources and state that Mahākaccāyana, a disciple of Lord Buddha, the author of Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa.  But this is  not is traced  out  in  canonical  literature.   Non-canonical literature   as  well as  the commentaries on the Kaccāyana-vyākaraṇa are composed in the later period and  are not enough to support the traditionalists'  views.

yana-vannana (17th century A.D.). However, they *are* not supported by any canonical text. They also do not quote the sources from where they have got this 129 information. 

4.2 **Buddhaghosa,** who belonged to 5th century A.D. ^ was the greatest commentator in Pali literature. He was not acquainted with the **Kaccayana—vy**— 
akarana. If in the **Buddhaghosa**'s time Kaccayana's work was well-known and accepted as the authority on Pali grammar, he certainly would have used Kaccayana's terminology. However, we find differences in terminology used by **Buddhaghosa** and **Kaccayana** as foilows : - 

| Buddhaghosa   | Kaccayana   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Paccattam     | Pathamam    |
| Upayogam      | Dutiya      |

129. Cf. **KnI** Introd., pp. 38-39. 

130. It is believed that Kaccayana's grammar was brought to Myanmar in 387 A.D. by Buddhaghosa (**KPB** 
Introd., p. V ).

It is maintained that Kaccayana must be later than Buddhaghosa , since the latter doe s not refer to him. Buddhaghos a was acquainted **with Panini'** s gramma r **and** 
1 33 quoted it as an authority . Thu s according to the third view the **Kaccayana—vyakarana** was composed eithe r by a Sri Lankan or a South Indian author and not by Mahakaccayana . Further , it is also maintained that he composed not only the sutta-s , but also vutti and udaharana-B . 

Subsequently the date of Kaccayana' B compositio n also is disputed. Let us summariz e the differen t opinion s in this regard:— 
(1) J. **D'AIwis** believe s that Kaccayana was one of the eighty eminent disciple s of Lord Buddha . He must have flourished in the latter half of the sixth 134 century before Christ . 

(2) According to G.E. **Fryer** , Kaccayana lived in or 133. **PLL** p. 37 , **HPL** II p. 632 , PL p. 163 , **P6R** Introd. , 
p. XXX; for details cf . **SPS I** and **SPG II. 1.** O.H. **Find** 
has shown clearly **how** did **Buddhaghos** a make use **of** 
Panini's grammar in solving the grammatical points in his works e.g. Visuddhimagga **, Samantapasadik** a and Sumangalavi1asini etc .

about the twelfth century of the Christian *era.* 135 
(3) S.C. **Vidyabhusana** quotes two examples from Kaccayana " as the source **and** states that Kaccayana flourished after 250 B.C. He also refers to Katyayanavavada sutra mentioned in the **Madhyamika vrtti** of Candrakirti. He, therefore, concludes that Kaccayana lived before the 3rd century A.D. He thinks that Madhura was the place of residence of Kaccayana and he quotes " I to madhuraya catusu yojanesu Sankassam nama nagaram atthi, tattha bahu jana vasanti" "" as the source for this. 

(4) According to **Windish,** Kaccayana's work must at 139 all events be later than the 4th century A.D. 

(5) According to A.**A. Macdonell,** Kaccayana's work 140 seems to date between 500 and lOOO A.D. 

(6) G.P. **Malalasekera** refers to the tika—s written during and soon after the reign of **Parakramabahu I** 
135. **NPK** p. 121. If we accept the **liuk hama t tadi pan i** , the oldest and first commentary on the Kaccayana as belonging to 11th century, the date assumed by **Fryer** is certainly unacceptable. Dr. **Hoernle (ibid.,** pp. 125—127) 
disagrees with him. 

136. See fn. 123, 125. 137. KG Introd., p. XXVIII. 138. Kacc III. 5. 139. Quoted from **PLL** p. 37 fn. 6.

(1164 A.D.) and finds that their terminology tallies with that of Kaccayana. Therefore he concludes that the Kaccayana cacne to be put into its present form and recognized in Sri Lanka as an authority on Pali grammar sometime between the century after Buddhaghosa and the eleventh century. 

(7) According to H. Scharfe, the Kaccayana—vyakarana was written between the 5th and the 11th century 
(8) According K.R. **Norman,** Kaccayana might have used the Kasika (7th A.D.) . In that case he is later 143 than the seventh century. But the evidence for this 144 is d isputed. 

(9) According to O.H. Pind, perhaps Kaccayana dates from the 7th —Sth century A.D. since his work is not referred to in any of the atthakathas except Ap - a , 
a fairly late commentary. 

141. PLC p. 184. He elsewhere **(DPPN** I p. 478) says that Kaccayana probably belongs to the fifth or sixth century A.D. 

142. GE p. 194. 143 PL p. 163, he quotes Franke, Gramm, pp. 17—19 as the source for this, cf. PLL p. 37. 

144. H. Scharfe (GE p. 194 fn. 8) says that R.O. 

Franke's attempts to show influence of the Kasika on Kaccayana are not convincing".

Thus the authorship and the date of Kaccayanavyakarana are still disputed. It is difficult to solve these problems satisfactorily. However, I incline to share the view that the author of the Kaccayanavyakarana, might be either a Sri Lankan or a South Indian monk whose name was similar to Mahakacc**ayana**, a disciple of Lord Buddha. If we accept **Buddhaghosa** as belonging to 5th century A.D., Kaccayana must be later than him as mentioned above. Sharing the view of Malalasekera and **Scharfe,** it may be said **Kaccayana—** 
vyakarana might have been written between 5th (or 6th) 
and 11th century A.D. In spite of some differences regarding the authorship and the date, most of the Pali scholars accept that Kaccayana's is the oldest Pali grammar which exists so far. It is very useful for one who would like to study Pali language and Theravada Buddhism. As **W. Subhuti** remarks: "Nevertheless, we can affirm without hesitation that the grammar of Kachchayana is the most ancient of Pali grammar; that it was composed by the first rate scholar, and that it is a very useful and valuable work for acquiring a knowledge of the Pali language". 

## Contents Of Kaccayana - Vyakarana

The **Kaccayana—vyakarana** is divided into four broad chapters known as kappa, namely, (1) **Sandhi—kappa** 
having five kanda—s (2) **Nama—kappa** having eight kanda—s 
(including **Karaka, Samasa** *and* Taddhita) (3> Akhyatakappa having four kanda-s (4) **Kitaka-kappa** having six kanda-5 (including **Unadi).** For the convenience of study, it is also divided into eight chapters as foilDW5: - 
(1) **Sandhi-kappa**: the chapter on combination. It contains five sections (kanda-s). The total number of the sutta—s is 51. 

(2) **Nama—kappa:** the chapter on nouns. It contains five sections. The total number of the sutta-s is 221. 

(3) **Karaka-kappa**: the chapter on syntax. The total number of the sutta—s is 45. 

(4) **Samasa-kappa**: the chapter on compounds. The total number of the sutta-s is 2S. 

(5) Taddhita - **kappa:** the chapter on the nominal derivatives. The total number of the sutta-s is 62. 

(6) **Akhyata-kappa**: the chapter on verbs. It contains five sections. The total number of the sutta-s is 118. 

(7) **Kitaka-kappa:** the chapter on the verbal derivatives. It contains five sections. The total number of the sutta—s is lOO. 

(8) **Unadi-kappa:** the chapter on the particles. The total number of the sutta-s is 50. 

Each chapter contains the sutta-s, vutti and udaharana-5. The number of the sutta-s mentioned above is according to Se. They in total are 675. The different numbers of sutta-s according to different versions are as foilows:— 
- According to T the total number of sutta—s is 677. - According to B^ and S^ " " " " " 673, But S2 and KV De have the same number as Se. The Suttaniddesa and **Kaccayana—vannana** CBurmese edition] 
have the same number as B^ and *S^.* But the **Nyasapatha** 
[Burmese edition] contains 708 sutta-s i.e. 35 sutta—s more than Kaccayana —**vyakarana** . There *a.re* 32 additional sutta—s in Karaka—kappa, 2 in **Nama—kappa,** and 1 in Samasa—kappa. In the **Nyasapatha** edition, the additional sutta-s are shown by the device of subdivisions so that the total number is made consistent with that of the original version e.g. in the **Karaka—** 
kappa the sutta 315, is subdivided as follows:-
315 **Ka,** 315 **Kha,** 315 Ga, 315 **Gha**, 315 Na etc. **Ka** 
indicates the original sutta, whereas **Kha** onwards indicate the extra sutta-s so that the total number is keeping with Bj^ and *S^.* Three texts i.e. **Nyasapatha,** 
Suttaniddesa and **Kaccayana—vannana** took the sutta—s from Kaccayana and explained them accordingly unlike the **Rupasiddhi** which has taken sutta-s from Kaccayana and re-arranged them to suit its method. 

Kaccayana tradition There *are* several commentaries on the Kaccayanavyakarana. They are:-
(1) Mukhamattadipani or **Kaccayana—nyasa** referred to as **Nyasa:** This is supposed to be the oldest and best commentary on Kaccayana. According to the Gandhavamsa and others, the author was **Vima1abuddhi** of 147 Pagan but according to some other authorities he 148 - -
belonged to Sri Lanka. He also wrote a tika on his 149 - 
own work. According to the **Saddaniti** and the Pitakat—samuin the author was **Vajirabuddhi** who lived in **Mahavihara** monastery at Anuradhapura of Sri 150 Lanka. This work was probably composed in the eleventh century. It explains the rules of Kaccayana (with some additional rules) with copious examples followed by detailed examination. Its method of treatment is very exhaustive, because every word of each rule is discussed by referring to its context, 1 52 meaning, analysis, question and answer. ^ There are two commentaries on it, namely, 1.1 **Nyasappadipa—tika**: This is the earliest commentary on the **Nyasa** composed during the reign of the king **Narapatisithu (1174** A.D.) by a minister of 147.

request of his pupil **Dhaminacari** . It may be noted here that there were two Burmese monks who had the same name and went to Sri Lanka in different periods. There is much confusion therefore in identifying the author of the **Suttaniddesa**. According to **M.H. Bode** and **W.** 
Geiger, the former chappada was the author of the Suttaniddesa which was composed in the twelfth 178 century. However, in this regard Somapala Jayawardhana observes: "There seems to be a confusion between two Burmese monks named Chapata and Chappata or Chappada. The earlier, the pupil of the Elder Uttarajiva, accompanied his teacher to Ceylon in the twelfth century and received ordination from the Ceylon Sangha. 

He returned to Burma with four other bhikkhus, where he established a new ordination lineage. The second chappata was a Burmese monk who came to Ceylon during the reign of king Parakrama-bahu VI (1412-1467), who had his capital at Jayawardhanapura. This latter chappata was also known by the name Saddhammajoti-
- 179 pala". According to him, the latter only was the author of the **Suttaniddesa** as mentioned above.

187 Vacakopadesa composed by **Mahavijitavi** in 1606 A.D. i 8 Q 
There is another **Mahavijitavi.** 
It may be noted here that this author is not the 187. **Ibid., p.** 104. If the year 1606 A.D. as the date of the tika is correct, the **Vacakopadesa** would have been composed before **Kaccayana—vannana**. Therefore its author must have lived at about the sixteenth century as pointed out by **Ma 1 a 1asekera**. The period between the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth century may be fixed even if the author of the **Vacakopadesa** and the tika is the same person or not. **H. Oldenberg (ibid.,** p. 104) remarks: "... The commentator then gives his own name, which is identical with that of the author". As remarked by him, the authors of the **Vacakopadesa** and the tika seem to be different persons. In this regard M.H. Bode (PLB p. 

46 fn. 4) gives P.TH. p. 71 (= **Pit-sm** 414-5) as the source and states: "The commentary on Vacakopadesa, by another Vijitavi, was written at Sagiang". However, according to **Pit—sm 414-5 Mahavijitavi** not only composed the **Vacakopadesa,** but also the Vacakopadesa—tika at Sagiang in the thirteenth century. As the evidences show, the author of the **Vacakopadesa-tika** 
is a different person belonging to a different period. 

thirteenth century. 

same person as that of the **Kaccayana—vannana** and the Vacakopadesa as remarked above. Thus, there are two authors who bear the same name.

We may follow the classification of Kaccayana tradition given by W. Geiger in **PLL**. He gives the nos . 

17-24 for the texts as discussed above. ^ It is, however, not easy to say whether these grammatical texts belong to Kaccayana, Moggallana or they *ATG* 
independent works. But one thing is certain that among the three schools of Pali grammar the Kaccayanavyakarana is the oldest and well-known on which there are many commentaries. Further detailed research would prove the extensive influence of Kaccayana tradition. 

Such a research may fix up to which school a particular text belongs. There are still many grammatical texts recorded in Gv, Sas, Nam, gramm 
(PGL), Pit-sm, PLB, PLC, CPD etc; for examples, Rupamala, Saddamedhani, Akkharavisodhani, Akkharakosa11 a, Sambandhama1 ini, Lingavivarana, Niru11isaramanJusa, Akkharamala, Padacinta, Nirutt**ibheda, Kaccayanarupadi**— 
pani, Niruttiyojana etc. Many of them still lie buried in manuscript form. Some are reported to have been 283 lost. Some of them are published in Burmese script; some in Sinhalese, few in Thai, Roman, Devanagari, and Bengali scripts.

283. There is a rich bibliography on Pali grammar entitled "Some works on Pali grammar, Rhetoric and 
(contd. to the next page) 
Outline of the present attempt In the field of Pali grammatical literature the 
(contd. from the previous page) 
prosody" by D.L. **Barua** in IC 15, pp. 194-202. It may be noted here that the compiler has been misled by some sources- Therefore the readers should refer to it with caution. Otherwise the bibliography is useful. 

Reference may also be made to the "Handbook of Pali Literature (= **HOP)"** by Somapala **Jayawardhana**. He makes use of Subhuti's **Namamala** and the other sources in the Pali grammar's section. However, he mostly follows Subhuti. This work gives more details than **PLL** of Geiger. And it seems to improve and replace **PLL** in some respects. However **Jayawardhana** did not make use of the latest materials. He commited the same mistakes as **Subhuti** whom he quotes as his source cf. 

SNS pp. 79-109 in **JPTS XI,** 1987. Still **HOP** has very useful information regarding the Pali grammar. As far as the grammatical texts of Pali grammar are concerned, the **Namamala** is a very exhaustive treatise on Pali grammar. It is a pioneer work even if it has some defects. It is still considered as the best of grammatical works. It was written in Sinhalese language, but we get some abstracts of it in **PLL** and HOP. Particularly W. **Geiger** wrote his works on grammatical sections based on the **Namamala.** 
In the present study readers will find some discussions with reference to it. 

Kaccayana - vyakarana is considered as the oldest and important text and has become a constant subject of study in the monasteries where the Theravada Buddhists lived. The present attempt is to study and interpret the entire work of Kaccayana. The present researcher desires to explore the precise method of the Kaccayanavyakarana in the light of concerned Pali literature. 

The thesis consists of four parts. they are;— 
(1) **Text: The Kaccayana-vyakarana** has eight chapters. An attempt is being made here to study the entire work of the **Kaccayana—vyakarana**. The text of this thesis is presented in the Roman script. The Kaccayanappakaranam by **M.E. Senart** was published in Journal Asiatique (pp. 193-540) Paris, 1871 which is used for the present study and in the same year it was published separately in the book form (pp. 1—338) also. 

In some cases **Senart** made corrections in the book form. 

The printing mistakes *sre* corrected herein in the present research. **Senart** edited the work long ago and his edition was to be improved upon. It is clear from the different versions of Kaccayana that several readings chosen by **Senart** in his edition are questionable or even erroneous. In his edition the sutta-s *sre* printed in the Devanagari script, whereas the remaining work is printed in Roman script. In the present thesis sutta-s are transliterated in Roman script. It may be noted here that the system of Romanisation adopted by **Senart** is obsolete. The system of Romanisation laid down by **PTS** is followed in the present thesis. In the light of different versions the critical remarks *are* made in the notes. The said versions are:— 
1.1 **Bj^: Kaccayana-vyakarana** (Burmese script) by Visodhakasamiti, Buddhasasanasamiti, Rangoon, 11th repr. 198S. 

B2 nis is quoted in the Bj^'s foot - notes. 

1.2 **Si! Kaccayana Vutti** (Sinhalese script) by the Venerble **Dharmakirti** Sri Dharmarama, Fredrick Perera Abayasinha Appuhamy, Colombo, 1904. 

1.3 S2- **Kaccayana** (Sinhalese script) by Gunaratna Thera, Venerable M., M.U. Subaseris Perera and B.L. 

Perera, Colombo 1913. 

1.4 **T: KaccayanamuI am nama pakaranam** (Thai script) by **Phravisuddhisambodhi**, Mahamakutarajavidyalaya, Bangkok, 1931. 

Se'5 edition is presented as basic one. Variant readings are recorded in the notes. It may be noted here that **A,Cd,K,S** , S , S , S , S^, S versions recorded in the Se's foot-notes also occasionally are used. However, as far as **the** Kaccayana's versions are concerned, B^ is the best text and it is considered as the standard text. Because its editors make use of the concerned grammatical Pali texts **e.g. Nyasa, Rupa—** 
siddhi, Suttaniddesa and **Kaccayana—vannana** etc. 

and trace out all the quotations available in the footnotes. It is clear that new critical edition of **Kacca—** 
yana—vyakarana in the place of Se is needed. **Senart** 
did not have much materials at his disposal. His edition was the first one in Roman script. These limitations must be taken into account while evaluating S e's work. 

The present study improves also on the work entitled **The Pali Text of Kachehayana's Grammar with** 
English Annotations (=PKB) (1870) by F. **Mason.** That editor has brought out the entire text of Kaccayana in Burmese script. Therein he has summarised each kappa and has given some notes and variant readings of some rules. This book is also useful in some cases even if it is not always free from mistakes. In the present work reference is also made to that book when necessary. 

The present researcher has also studied the critical edition in Devanagari script entitled Kaccayana vyakarana (= **KV De)** (1989) by **L.N.Tiwary** and **B. Sharma.** 
The editors make use of Se, Sj;^ , 82? as the basis of their edition. The present researcher has consulted also those versions in their original forms. It is found that the editors have not presented the versions correctly at several places, while giving the variant readings. Even in the enlarged and revised edition the mistakes *Are* not corrected. Let us point out some errors: KV De p. 157 records **dainso** and **makaso** 
belonging to **Senart** in the foot-notes 11 and 12, but in fact Se p. 366 reads **damsam** and masakam, KV De p. 19O 
fn. 5 records: 'Se does not have **sankhyapuran—** 
atthe', but Se p. 402 has it. **KV De** p, 265 fn. 

1 records: 'Se reads **purita'**, but Se p. 479 reads purati. Similar many cases are found in this edition. 

The book consists of an exhaustive Introduction, text, translation and useful notes in Hindi. It is very useful for the Hindi readers. The **Dhatumanjusa** of Silavamsa is added at the end of this edition {pp. 321327) . Other versions of Kaccayana do not record it. 

Having seen the versions in original form, the KV De edition is in a way improved upon in the present study. 

(2) **Translation:** the sutta-s, vutti, and udaharana—B are translated into English. Translation of udaharana-5 is appearing first time in English at several places. The **Kaccayana—vyakarana** was translated first into an European language. M.E. 

Senart brought out a critical edition and translation along with notes in French in 1871. English translation was made by S.C. **Vidyabhusana** under the title Kaccayana's Pali grammar (=KG) (1901). He made use of Se's edition as the basis and translated the entire work into English first time. He, however, translated the sutta-s and vutti mixing together. So it is difficult to distinguish between sutta-s and vutti. And there dire no notes (except few remarks). The examples also are not translated. S.K. Chatterji (**KV De** For . p.I) 
remarks on this edition: "This was not a very successful edition". As Se contains many corrupt readings, KB translation is not always free from mistakes. It was the first attempt to translate **Kacca—** 
yana - **vyakarana** in English. To some extent this **work** was useful for the present translation even if its translation is not always accepted, because it is based on a corrupt text. 

Reference is also made to the book by J. **D'Alwis** 
entitled An Introduction to Kachehayana's Grammar of the Pali Language (=IKP) (1883) J. **D'Alwis** has translated first ten sutta's of the **Sandhi - kappa** (p. 

XVII) only. He has also brought out on edition of the Akhyata-kappa in Sinhalese script (pp- I - XVI at the end of the text) . He translated alon'^ gwith useful notes 
(pp. 1—52). He quotes from some grammatical texts either in Introduction or in appendix. So far as we know, he was the first person who had studied the Kaccayana—vyakarana systematically to write an exhaustive Introduction. He, however, did not give the details about Kaccayana's commentaries, but only referred to the texts occuring in his work. He did his work long ago and much new material appeared later on. 

Reference is made to some shortcomings in his work. 

However, it is the best book written in English so far for one who would like to study Kaccayana system. 

After his work no such work appeared. This work also was used for the present study. 

Apar t fro m the *Eurapeatn tr&n^l st ians there sre* many translations in Burmese, Thai, Sinhalese, Hindi and other languages. As far as the Pali grammatical texts are concerned, the (Burmese) Nissaya is considered as the most useful one. And Burmese Pali grammarians have brought out many versions of **Nissaya.** Unfortunately due to the linguistic limitation these Nissaya—s could not be used in the present work, otherwise it would have been enriched more than its present form. 

(3) **Notes:** The notes consist of four parts: 
3.1 a summery of each kappa. 

3.2 the critical comments on the arrangement of the rules in each kappa. 

3.3 variant readings of different versions along with the critical comments wherever they *3.re* necessary and important. Apart from the said versions reference is also made to Kaccayana's commentaries e.g. 

Nyasa, Rupasiddhi, Suttaniddesa, Kaccayana—vannana etc. 

to support the critical comments. However, reference is made often to the **Nyasa** as the final authority. 

3.4 **Quotations:** among all the versions of Kaccay ana —vy akarana there is only Bj^ having referred to the quotations at the foot-notes. Few of them *are* recorded in T. Some of them *are* not recorded even in B^ also. Se recorded few of them in the notes to support his view occasionally. But S;^ , S2 do not record them at all. The present attempt is to study quotations based upon Bj^ . However, this attempt is different from Bj^ . The present work refers not just to title or a word, but to the entire passage concerned. In this context, following observations may be noted3.4-1 Bj^ does not follow a particular system of reference such as **Vinaya, Sutta** and **Abhidhamma;** 
atthakatha-s tika-s and **anutka** —s etc. **B-i** ' s treatment - • **a * - -L** 
of quotations seems to be rather arbritrary. It does not follow any particular system to present citations. 

3.4.2 Some well known quotations do not appear at all, e.g. **Savitti chandaso mukham, evain mahiddhika esa** 
etc. but they are recorded in T, see **Notes** 1.3 under the rule 4 cf. **Sadd** 619 fn. 8 and **Notes I. 4** under the rule *6t.* 
3.4.3 Occasionally B'j^ quotes wrongly e.g. sa silava, sa pannava etc. B^ refers to **Dhp** 84, where we find only **sa silava;** but **sa pannava** is not recorded, however, we find it occuring in Ja V 148 and refer to it, see **Notes** 1.3 under the rule 5. For cattaro'me bhikkhave dhamma B^ quotes A II 5, lO-ll as follows:-
"cattaro'me bhikkhave puggala santo samvijjamana lokasmim" which is not exact to the passage expected above. But we find the exact passage occurring in A 
II 147, 18-19 see **Notes 1.2.** under the rule 2. 

3.4.4 sometimes B^ quotes the whole prosesentence e.g. **tinno parangato ahu** as an example occuring in **Dhp** 414, but **Dhp** reads **jhayi** for **ahu** and does not have the full prose—sentence referred to by B±. Csee **Notes** 1.3 under the rule 1] In this case, however, **H. Smith (Sadd** 619 fn. 18) considers it as untraced quotation with " c f . **Dhp** 414-, B VI 157, 9". 

And sosnetimes if B^ cannot trace out the prosesentence in the full form, it refers to the concerned word only e.g. **yatha —ri—va vasudhatalan ca sabbain:** as this cannot be traced in the full form, S^ refers to yatha—ri—va only. See **Notes 1.2** under the rule 11. 

Pag'eva vutyassa: here only pag'eva is recorded as full citation could not be traced out. See **Notes 1.5** under the rule 2. It may be noted here that in this case, Saddaniti has changed **vutyassa** into **itara paja** so that pag'**eva itara paja:** can be traced out in the canon, see Sadd 681 fn.ll, **Ja III** 111, 20, V . X. J- , ^ 4 and **A II** 75 36. **Aggavamsa,** while treating Kaccayana's citations, seems to adopt the same method. He might have changed some words in order to suit the canonical references. 

3.4.5 Sometimes B^ quotes the citations having just an apparent verbal similarity e.g. **hanu:** occurs **in** 
Kacc VIII. 48, B^ quotes D II 18, 16 as: "ayam hi deva kumaro sihahanu", **dhatu:** occurs in **Kacc VIII.** 4S, *B^* 
quotes M I 57, 36-37 as: "atthi imasmim kaye pathavidhatu apodhatu tejodhatu". Thus, the words to be proved *sre* not keeping with the examples referred to. 

Similar *sire* the words like **gopphimo, subharo,** jenadatti, ghatiyati etc.; concerned citations *are* left out in the present study. Sometimes Bj^ quotes a citation. But it is not traceable in the literature available today e.g. **tarn sadhu ti patissunitva**: 
occurs in **Kacc** I. 4.1. Such citations *sire* left out. 

is proved, B^ should quote example for the same-
However, it appears that B^ quotes another quotation having the form similar to the proved form and not exactly the same form e.g. **vedhavero,** but quotation gives the form **vedhavera; saririka** for saririkanam; gandhiko for **gandhlka** see **Notes V** under the rules 6, 7 and S etc. The similar cases also are found often in B^ 's quotations. 

3.4.7 Sometimes B^ quotes many sources as examples. In such cases, only one example is studied. But if the same has occurred earlier the repetition is avoided by just mentioning the source. 

Critical study of those citations along with the Burmese traditional literature on **Saddaniti** and Rupasiddhi would be desirable, which, however is a formidable task beyond the scope of present attempt. 

The study of the citations occurring in the present versions of **Kaccayana** as well as in **Saddaniti** and Rupasiddhi is left for future research. **Rupasiddhi** and Saddaniti have mostly borrowed the examples from Kaccayana with slight modifications in some cases. 

(4) Bibliography: The thesis uses not only English sources, but also the editions available in Thai, Sinhalese, Burmese and Devanagari. The bibliography covers detailed description of the sources. 

Thus, the objective of this thesis is to study Kaccayana's treatment of the whole Pali grammar. It is hoped that this study would render inspiration for the study of other schools of Pali grammar e.g. **Moggallana** 
and **Saddaniti** which is still neglected by the scholars. References may be made to a recent publication entitled the Saddabindu and its "New' Subcommentary by F. Lottermoser which appeared in **JPTS** 
vol. XI 1987 pp. 79-109. However we have not a critical edition of the **Mogga11ana-vyakarana** in Roman script, as we have **Kaccayanappakarana by M.E. Senart** 
and **Saddaniti by H. Smith.** 
Roman editions of Pali grammatical commentaries is still a dream! Similar topic for further study would be the comparative approach to the three schools of Pali grammar. 

Reference should be made here to some devices used while presenting the text in a present thesis. As usual, the figures preceding the sutta-s refer to the sections and sutta-s, however, the figures following the sutta-s indicate the serial numbers of sutta - s throughout the Kaccayana—vy**akarana**. 

The system of Kaccayana's quotation is as Chapter/Section/Ru1e'5 number e.g. II. 3.1 indicates Chapter II (**Nama-kappa**)/Section (Kanda) 3/Rule no, 1. 

If a chapter does not contain the sections, the system would be: **Chapter/Rule's** number e.g. III.3 indicate? 

Chapter 3 (Karaka-kappa)/Ru1e no. 3. It may be noted here that the rules quoted include the vutti and udaharana-5 also except where otherwise stated. The system of abbreviations of the titles of Pali texts laid down in the Epilegomena to **CPD I** is followed, on which the other abbreviations also are based. References to Pali texts indicate the **PTS** editions except stated otherwise.

# Notes I.1,

This first section is devoted to sannavidhana and sarasandhi and covers first eleven rules. The word sandhi is derived from sam + dha (sam means near by, together; **dha** means put, place, lay in or on, bestow, 2 hold) ; literal meaning would be: 'putting together' Kaccayana and Moggallana do not give the meaning of sandhi, but **Aggavamsa** gives it: "It is called sandhi due to joining the words and sounds together". A.P. 

Buddhadatta gives it: "When two letters of the same word or of two different words *Ar&* joined together for the sake of euphony the union is called sandhi (combination 4 or fitting together)". It may be noted here that a vowel due to sandhi can be changed into another one, but the words and meanings remain unchanged. 

1. "sam pubbo dha dharane" **Abh—suci,** s.v. **sandhi.** 
2. "union, junction, breach, break, hole, chasm, a window, joint, piece, link, connection, combination, euphonic junction, euphony, agreement" **PED**, s.v. 

sandhi, cf. MW, s.v. **sam— dhi.** 3. "sandhiyanti ettha padani akkharani ca ti sandhi" **Sadd 611,** 20. 4. NPC II p.3, see also **EPG** p.l3, **GPL** p.3, **PGP** p.5. 

AggavaniBa has divided sandhi briefly into two kinds: 
(1) **padasandhi** (the euphonic combination of words) 
which is also called external sandhi or word sandhi e.g. **tatrayam** (2) **vannasandhi** (the euphonic combination of sounds) which is also called internal sandhi e.g. **sahu; khatya."** Sandhi is generally divided into three kinds: (1) **sarasandhi** (combination of vowels) (2) 
vyanjanasandhi (combination of consonants) (3) niggahitasandhi (combination of nasal and a vowel or a consonant). Kaccayana and Moggallana do not 5. "Api c'ettha dvidha ca pi samkhepa sandhi icchito padanam padasandhi ca vannanam vannasandhi ca; tesu "tatrayam" ice adi padasandhi ti dipaye, vannasandhi ti dipeyya" sahu; khatya" ti adikam" Sadd 610, 29-32, see also **EPG** pp. 13-14, PBR p. 60 , SPL p.59, CP III pp.219-224, **OSP** pp. lOl ff. 

6. See **NPC** II, p. 3, but **EPG** p. 14 and **PGP** p. £,: 
(1) **vowel sandhi** (2) **vomissakasandhi** (mixed sandhi) 
(3) **niggahitasandhi**, here **EPG** and **PGP** consider vomissakasandhi as **byanjanasandhi**, and **EPG** p.15 further remarks: " Strictly speaking, there is no consonantal sandhi in Pali, because no word in it, as a rule, ends in a consonant, excepting •?" J see also **SPL** p. 59. 

divide sandhi categorically, but we may remark that it is divided into three kinds as mentioned above. In this context, **Buddhappiya** re—arranges the rules of sandhi in **Kaccayana—vyakarana** according to their functions in order to help students understand them with 
'\r '\r __ 
ease and divides into five kinds: (1) sannavidhana (2) 
sarasandhi (3) nisedhanasandhi (pakatisandhi) (4) 
byanjanasandhi (5) niggahitasandhi. 

But **Aggavamsa** has divided into four kinds: (1) 
sarasandhi (2) byanjanasandhi (3) niggahitasandhi (4) 
sadharanasandhi. lO In fact, he has divided only into three kinds: **(1) sarasandhi (2) byanjanasandhi** (3) 
vomissasandhi. Moreover, he considers niggahitasandhi 7. See Mogg pp- 1-7.

In the first rule it is said that the meanin g is known by the sound only . It is traditionall y believed that the first rule in Pali grammar was uttere d by Gotam a or Kaccayana himself . Franci s **Mason** says : "This aphoris m is by some attributed to Gaudama and by other s to kachchayan o himself . Ther e is nothing in the text to indicate that it had not the same author as the other aphorisms . Some of the old commentator s say that it is not an aphorism, **sutta,** but the first "saying "

"missibhutanam saravyanjanadinam sandhi vomissasandhi; tatha hi saravyanjananiggahitadesa1opakaranavasena sadhito sandhi vomissasandhi ti vuccati, so eva saravyanjananiggahitadesalopaviparitadivasena anekasangahatta sadharanasandhi ti ca vuccati" **ibid.,** 627, 24-28, even if R.C. Childers (OSP p.lOO) has divided it into three kinds: (1) **vowel sandhi (2) consonant** 
sandhi (3) mixed sandhi, in this case, we may remark that he follows **Aggavamsa's** method, see also **GPL** p. 3, PM p.45. 

1 3. **PKG** p.3. 

Akkhara means "sound, tone, word" 14 "that which 15 does not obtain the state of roughness or harshness 16 "that which is imperishable". 

Kaccayana emphasises skilfulness in akkhara, because one who is not well—versed in it, cannot understand the Tipitaka clearly, otherwise, while reading the Tipitaka, one would be misled. 

Therefore, it is said that "one who, while learning the Tipitaka, does not learn etymological interpretation, he may doubt in every word (of it) just as a blind elephant 
(roams) in the forest". So, first of all, he has laid down this rule. 

After having indicated the importance of sounds, Kaccayana enumerates the sounds numbering forty—one, consisting of thirty three consonants and eight vowels. 

14. See **PED** and **CPD** s.v. **akkhara, MW**, s.v. **akshara.** 15. "atisukhumagambhirasamketesu parivattamana pi kharattam thaddhabhavam na gacchanti ativiya mudu hutva atthavasena na kharanti, tasma akkhara ti vuccanti" **Sadd** 605, 1-4.

17."Y D niruttim na sikkheyya sikkhanto pitakattayam pade pade vikankheyya vane andhagajo yatha" Mogg-pt 16, 5-6. 

1 Q 
But Moggallana says that the Pali sounds are 43 , . - ^ -•^ . 

including the short e e.g. **ettha** and **o e.g. sotthi ,** 
Buddhappiya does not accept Moggallana's view and says: 
"Kaccayana remarks! as far as Buddha's discourse is concerned, the number of the sounds does not 19 -
exceed 41". In this context, Vacissara supports Moggallana's view and remarks: "some ignorant people quote the verse written in Rupasiddhi ... (as remarked above) , (however) the number of the sounds exceeds 41 due •'^ A 2 0 to e (et) and o (ot) vowels ...". 

In the rules 2—9, Kaccayana deals with the division of sounds and has referred to some grammatical terms from Sanskrit grammar for the sake of convenience in usages. The rules lO and 11 are introductory for the sake of conjunction. **Buddhappiya** classifies the rules 'V 'V 
1—9 under sannavidhana, lO and 11 under sarasandhi. In 19. "adhikakkharavantani ekatalisato ito na Buddhavacanani ti dipet'acariyasabho" Rup 3,13-14. 

2 0. "... Rupasiddhiyam likhitam imam gatham vatva keci

no connection with it, regarded as orthoepy". 

In this kanda, there are 11 rules, in the third rule the word **tattha** is used in the sense of **akkharesu;** the word **tattha** is shorter than **akkharesu.** In the rule 4 the word **sara** is understood from previous rule, similarly, in the following rule also. In the rule 4 the word **tattha** also is understood from preceding rule. 

In the rule 6 the word **akkhara** is understood from the second rule. The rules 7, 8, 9 *are* independent rules. 

In the rules 7 and 8 definitions of the technical terms are given. The rule 9 is connected with general grammatical scheme of Kaccayana. The last two rules *Are* related to the process of sandhi. 

Rule 2: T, S2 read **-cattalisam** for **-cattalisam.** In T 
edition generally the sound 1 is found in the place of 1. In the Mss the spellings 1 and 1 are always 22 confused. We may accept either because both are in use. T, Bj^, Sj^, S2 read **iti** in the place of **ti.** Bj^, S^, 
S25 Cd read **tena** in the place of ice **anena** up to the rule 9 to avoid repetition of the term in question followed by ice anena. 

Rule 5: T, Bj^ , Sj^ , S2 add **tarn yatha** " J 
o iti digha nama (The long vowels are: a, i, u, e, o) ; T 
has **honti** after **nama.** In this context, **Senart** does not 2 1. **PKG** p.5. 

2 2. **PGR** p. 2 fn. 3. 

record them in his edition. According to the context, they are very significant. Therefore, we prefer to add them as shown by all the versions. 

Rule 6: T, *B^, ^i.t* ^2 J add **ta, tha, da, dha, na** after ta, tha, da, dha, na but **Senart** does not record them in his edition. However, according to the vutti they *Are* very significant, otherwise the groups of the consonants will not be complete. The consonants must be 33 , not 2B. Therefore, we have to add them. 

Rule 9: T reads **sak ka tagan t hesu B^, Sj^** , S2 read sakkataganthesu S reads sakkataganthesu for sakkatagandhesu, T generally reads **sakkata** in the place of **sakkata.** Either reading sakkata or **sakkata** 
stands for Sanskrit language. The word gandha or **gantha** means "text, composition, book" but **PED** quotes **gandha** as 23 misspelt by Burmese Mss."""" Dharmananda Kosambi also states: "In the Burmese script, for **tha, dha** is often wirtten, e.g. **gantha** "book" as **gandha** "perfume"; 
gutha as **gudha"** However, **Ariyavamsa** gives the meaning of **gandha** to apply to the text 25 But Moggallana, 2 3. **PED,** s.v. **gantha.** 24. Vism pre. p.X. 2 5. "attham gandheti suceti ti gandho, gandhiyati va attho suciyati etena ettha va ti gandho sakalam pakaranam" Manis - **t I** 69, 10-12. 

the author of **Abh,** uses **gandha** in the sense of perfume or smell as usual usage."^ The word **gantha** is always used in the sense of a text, canonical or non—canonica 1 . 

B^, S^, S2 read yujjante, T, S read **payujjante** for payunjante. The word yujjante or **payujjante** is used in the sense of passive voice according to the context of the vutti. Bj^ reads **ghosa** for **ghosavanto. T, Bi** » Sj^ , **S2** 
have la after ha but **Senart** does not record it in his - 

edition. As a ghosa, la must be there as shown by all the versions. In this context, if we read **ghosavanto** in the place of **ghosa,** also **aghosa** should be read as aghosavanto. 

Rule lO: "tatrayam adi": occurs in **Dhp** 375 as follows:— 
"tatrayam adi bhavati idha pannassa bhikkhuno; indriyagutti santutthi patimokkhe ca samvaro, mitte bhajassu kalyane suddhajive atandite". 

Rule 11: "tatrabhiratim iccheyya" : occurs in Dhp 88 as follows:-
"tatrabhiratim iccheyya hitva kame akincano pariyodapeyya attanam cittaklesehi pandito". 

The hemistich "akkocchi mam avadhi mam ajini mam - • - 

ahasi me": occurs in **Dhp** 3 as follows:-
"akkocchi mam avadhi mam ajini mam ahasi me ye tarn upanayhanti veram tesam na sammati".

Here ends the second section in the chapter on the sand hi. 

# Notes 1.2

This second section is devoted to sarasandhi and covers eleven rules. **Sara** means "sound, voice, intonation, accent". **Aggavamsa** gives the meaning of sara as: "Those are vowels which go to the state of being heard, or which lead the associated consonant to the state of being heard. The etymologist, however, says that vowels are those which shine forth themselves".'" **Buddhappiya** gives ass "Vowels *are* so called as 'they move or go' or as: 'they make the consonant move" and the meaning of sarasandhi as: 
"Joining of vowels'; moreover, "it is accomplished due 4 to changing and elision of vowel". According to A.P. 

1. See **PED,** s.v. **sara,** cf . MW s.v. *^stra,* see also Abh—suci s.v. **sara.** 
2. "saranti suyyamanatam gacchanti ti sara, attasamsat— 
"u thani va vyanjanani sarenti suyyamanatam gamenti ti pi sara; neruttika pana vadanti sayam rajanti ti sa-ra'ti" **Sadd** 605, 13-15. 3. "saranti gacchanti ti sara, byanjane sarenti tipi sara" **Rup** 4, 1-2. 

4. "saranafn saresu va sandhi sarasandhi. Ettha *(ZA* 
saradesalopakaranavasena sadhito sandhi sarasandhi ti Buddhadatta: "(Sarasandhi takes place) when a word ending in a vowel is joined to a word beginning with a vowel, or when two adjacent vowels, of the same word *sir&* 
5 joined together". 

In the second kanda, there are 11 rules. In the rule 13 the word **lopaip** is understood from previous rule. 

In the rule 14 the word **kvaci** cancels the word **va** 
occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 15 the word lutte and **kvaci** *are* understood from the preceding rule. 

However, the word **saro** also is understood from the rule 12 in which it occurs in plural [sara]. In the rule 16 the words **kvaci** and **digham** are understood from the rules 14 and 15, similarly, the word **saro** in singular is understood from the rule 12 where it occurs in plural. 

In the rule 17 the words **sare** and **kvaci** *sire* understood from the rules 12 and 14, similarly, in the rules 18, 19 and 20. In the rule 20 the word ca stands for **sabbo** according to the Kaccayana's scheme. The rules 19 and 20 are special rules about particular sound change. In the rule 21 the words na and va are used to cancel the word kvaci occuring in the rule 14. According to Nyasapatha, Rupasiddhi and **Suttaniddesapatha**, 
they stand for **kvaci** which means 'sometimes'. If 5, **NPC** II p.3, see also **EPG** p.14, **PGP** p. 5. 

6, "kvacisaddo ca navasaddo ca ime dve samanattha" Nyp 34, 1, "navasaddo kvacisaddena samanattho" **Sdp** 14 1 1, "navasaddo kvacisaddapariyayo" **Rup** 13, 12. 

it is so , Kaccayana would not have repeated it in the rule 21 . The rule 21 is general rule , but the rule 22 is special rule for particular words . In the last rule there are two grammatical operation s joint with the word ca because Kaccayana want s to cover this singl e expressio n in single rule . Also the word s na and va are understood from previous rule ; it mean s the rules 21 and 22 are covered under the expressio n na va . In the rule 22 also the word **saro** is understoo d from the rule 12 where it occurs in the plural . 

Rule 1: "yass'indriyani samatham gatani "

whateve r reading we may accept , changin g into the semi - vowel y is proved in these e>;pri5sions i.e. **ty ass** a or ty as5a . In the similar contex t K.R. **Norman** remarks : 
"Where the initial a- is followed by a doubl e consonant , 
the short -a - usually remain s after crasis , e.g. 

bahujano + assa> bahujanassa **, D III** 169 , 27* , The long —a - which arises from crasi s is , however , sometime s retained even before a double consonant , e.g. tayassu ,

Here ends the third section in the chapter on the sand hi . 

# Notes I.3

This third section is devoted to byanjanasandhi and covers seven rules. **byanjana** means "sign, mark, 1 ~ 
letter". It is derived from **vi + anja (vi** means clear, distinct, **anja** means cause to appear, make clear, shine, reveal, express); therefore the literal meaning is that 'by which the meaning is made clear"'^. 

Aggavamsa gives four explanations of byanjana as:- "Those which express the meaning after having depended on a vowel as in the case of **dhi, bhu, go** etc.; 
those which express the meaning after having depended on the collection of vanna - s together with vowels, as in the case of **buddho bhagava** etc.; according to the Buddhist etymologists, vyanjana - s *are* those which produce vowels; according to the Vedists vyanjana - s *3ire* those which follow vowels". Further, vyanjanasandhi is 1. See **PED,** 5.v- **byanjana,** cf- MW B.V - **vyanjana,** see also **SPW** s.v. **vyanjana, EPG** p.4 fn. 2. 

2. "byanjiyati etehi attho ti byanjana" **Rup** 5, 13, Nyp 18, 12. 

3. **"dhi bhu go** ti adisu saram nissaya, buddho bhagava ti adisu pana sasaram vannasamudayam nissaya attham vyanjayanti pakatam karonti ti vyanjana; saddha— 
_ '^ 
mmaneruttika pana "saram janenti ti vyanjanani" ti nj vadanti, "sare anugacchanti ti vyanjanani" ti vedavidu" Sadd 6D6, 2-7. 

explained as; "Joining of consonants which is accomplished due to substitution and elision of 4 *"^* 
consonants". A.P. **Buddhadatta** explains vyanjanasandhi a s: "When a word ending in a vowel is joined to a word 5 beginning with a consonant". 

Buddhappiya classifies the rules 1 and 2 under nisedhanasandhi (pakatisandhi). However, if we consider three kinds of sandhi—s as remarked in the chapter I, the rule 1 comes under byanjanasandhi, and 2 under sarasandi. 

In the third kanda, there *are* seven rules. In the rule 24 the words **sara** and **pakati** *sre* understood, but the word **kvaci** puts limit to the general rule 23. In the rule 25 the words **sara** and **byanjane** *sre* understood, therefore the word **sare** is cancelled. This is significant from the view-point of arrangement. The same is true with the rule 26. However, in the both the word **kvaci** is understood. In the rule 27 **two** 
grammatical operations are laid down with the use of the word **ca.** The words **sara, byanjane** and **kvaci** *sire* 4. "vyanjananam vyanjanesu va sandhi vyanjanasandhi; api ca vyanjanadesalopakaranavasena sadhito sandhi vyanjanasandhi ti vuccati" **ibid.,** 619, 27—620, 1-2. 

5. **NPC II** p.3, see also **EPG** p. 14, **PGP** p. 6. 

continued in the rule 27. The word **tatra** is significant because it is not generally used in a rule. It is used in the sense of locative absolute. In the rule 2S the word **thane** is in locative. It is significant because the position of the duplicated sound is indicated in the context of a single word. The last rule also deals with duplicated sound. However, the word **ghosaghosanam** is not defined by Kaccayana. In this context the rule 9 in the first kanda is important. In this last rule, also the word **thane** is understood. 

In the rule 28 the word **saramha** is understood in the context of the word **para.** Here Kaccayana uses the shorter word **para** instead of the word saramha or **sara.** 
Therefore the compound **paradvebhavo** is significant. In the rule 29 the word **akkhara** is understood from the rule 2 in the first kanda. If the word **akkhara** is not taken from that rule, the word **sara** continues from the beginning of the present kanda which, however, is not applicable here. This is rather strange from the view of the arrangement of the rules. 

Rule li *^i_r* ^2 read **pakatirupani** for **pakatirupa.** In this context we may note that nom. and ace. pi- neut. 

forms are found often truncated in the canonical poetry. "manopubbangama dhamma": occurs in **Dhp** 1 as foilOW5: 
" manopLibbangama dhamma monoBettha manomaya manasa ce padutthena bhasati va karoti va tato nam dukkham anveti cakkain va vahato padam". 

"pamado maccuno padam": occurs in **Dhp** 21 as foilowB:-
" appamado amatapadam pamado maccuno padam appamatta na miyant-i ye pamatta yatha mata". 

BjL reads **parangato** for **paragato,** 'tinno paragato ahu": occurs in **Dhp** 414 as follows:— 
"yo imam palipatham duggatn samsaram moham accaga tinno paragato jhayi anejo akathamkathi anupadaya nibbuto tarn aham brumi brahmanam". 

This quotation is given by Bj^ . The word **ahu** is not found in any version of **Dhp.** So, we may remark that in order to give the full sentence in prose as an example, the vutti might have replaced the nominal form jhayi with the verbal one, that is, **ahu.** 
Rule 2: **T, Bj^** read **pathaviin** for **pathaviin.** It may be noted here that according to orthography of Burmese Mss the reading **pathavi** is generally found. **PED** also gives 8 two forms as having the same meaning. "ko imam pathavim vijessati": occurs in **Dhp** 44 as follows:-
7. **PGR** p. 9. 

8. **PED,** s.v. pathavi. 

"ko imant pathavim vijessati yamalokam as imam sadevakam? 

ko dhammapadam sudesitam kusalo puppham iva - ppacessati?" . 

Bj^ reads **vicessati** for **vijessati** which is found in the 9 variant readings of **Dhp** 44 also appassut'ayam pur1so occurs in **Dhp** 152 as follows 
"appassut'ayam puriso balivaddo va jirati mamsani tassa vaddhanti panna tassa na vaddhati". 

Rule 3: T, *^i.r ^1* t ^2 read **sara . . . . papponti** for saro.... pappoti. Here Senart's reading is not keeping with the vutti; it should be in plural as it is shown by all the versions. There *Are* many such occurrences and Senart also reads **sara.... papponti** in the following vutti. Therefore the reading **sara....papponti** 
i s better.

"maranasannaparicitena bikkhave bhikkhuno cetasa bahulaip viharato jivitanikantiya cittam patiliyati patikutati pativattati na sampasariyati". "patihannati"; 
occurs in **Vin** II 147, 33 as follows:- "tato vatatapo gharo sanjato patihannati". 

The transformation of t into t is found in the Mss. **PED** indicates **pati** as a doublet of **pati.** 
iO- **PED,** s.v. **pati,** see also **PGR** p. 34 Rule 4: "bhovadinama so hotis occurs in **Dhp** 396 as foilows:—

"sammaditthi sammasamkappo sammavaca sammakammanto sammaajivo sammavayamo sammasati sammasamadhi". 

The splitting into **•a vitti** should be corrected to savitti. Savitti is a name of a Vedic mantra 11 representing the Veda-s. "savitti chandaso mukham" occurs in Sn 563 as follows:-
"aggihuttamukha yanna savitti chandaso mukham raja mukham manussanam. nadinam sagaro mukham". 

This is quoted by T. *^±r ^Ir* ^2 read —**appamayu**

- o muni": occurs in **Dhp** 26<7 as follows:-
"papani parivajjeti sa muni tena so muni yo munati ubho loke muni tena pavuccati" In this case, we may note that the addition of tena so muni after **so muni** by T, and **Senart** seems to be inappropriate. If the full pada is to be quoted, we have not so twice, but only once. Therefore, the quotation **so muni** is sufficient to prove the exception. The pada quoted by T, and **Senart** has not canonical support. 

"na so kasavam arahati": occurs in **Dhp** 9 as foilows: - 
"anikkasavo kasavaiji yo vattham par idahessa t i apeto damasaccena na so kasavam arahati". 

Rule 6: T B,, S^, S^ read **-ppamado^^** for **-ppamodo,** Senart's reading **—ppamodo** seems to be based on incorrect spelling. The semi—colon after purisassa should be put after **jantuno.** 'pabbajjam kittayissami"s occurs in Sn 405 as follows:— 
"pabbajjaip kittayissami yatha pabbaji cakkhuma yatha vimamsamano so pabbajjam samarocayi". 

Cd adds **pancadasi** has **pancaddasi** after catuddasi. Bj^ reads catuddasim; pancaddasim Sj^ , *^2-*
catuddasi; pancadasi, T: ca^uddasi; pancadda^i. The readings **catuddasi** and **catuddasi** *Are* found in the Mss but **catuddasi** is more often used. **Bi?** T, S give two examples which seem to be closer to the original, "^ but Senart thinks that **pancadasi** given by Cd is interpolated If by some copyist. Therefore he omits **pancadasi** in his edition. However, the words catuddasi or **catuddasim** and pancaddasi or **pancaddasim** occur in A I **144,** 1—3 as foil owB: - »v-
"catuddasi pancadasi yava pakkhassa atthami patihariyapakkhan *csi* atthangasusamagatam uposatham upavaseyya yo p'assa madiso naro". 

we may note that the readings **pancaddasi** and 14 Here pancadasi are found in the canonical texts. 

According to the rule the double d is expected. 

Therefore, in order to keep with the rule, the reading pancaddasiin or **pancaddasi** should be accepted. 

T, Bj^ , read **cando** in the place of **panitataro ca.** 
"idha modati" and "pecca modati" : occur in **Dhp** 16 as quoted above under 1.3.3. 

catuddasi; 13. **Nyp** also gives two examples e-g pancaddasi. 

14. See PTC, s.v. pancadasi. 

Rule 7: BJL j Si » *^2.'* **Cd , S** add **pubbesam, T: ^abbesam** 
after **vagge kho.** There is no paresam after **saramha** in a any version. **Senart** has used Cd and S fiss which also add **pubbesam** after **vagge kho.** He thinks that the reading **pubbesam** is unintelligible to hisn, so he emits it. In this case, he adds **paresain** after saramha. T, Bi j Si read ese va for **eso**'va. The reading maccusele should be split into two words e.g. maccu and sele, therefore the sentence should be corrected to yatra tthitam na-ppasaheyya and **se1e yatha pabbatamuddhani** 
tthito. "yatra tthitam na-ppasaheyya": occurs in **Dhp** 
12a (v.l.) as follows:-
"na antalikkhe na samuddamajjhe na pabbatanam vivaraip pavissa na vijjati so jagatippadeso yatra tthitam na-ppasaheyya maccu". 

"sele yatha pabbatamuddhani tthito": occurs in Vin I 
5, 33-34 as follows:—"sele yatha pabbatamuddhani tthito yathapi passe janatam samantato". **H. Oldenberg's** reading thito " would not support the rule explained in the vutti where the duplication **(tthito)** is expected, but the corresponding quotation found in It 33, 2—3 and D 
I I 3 9, lO—11, where the duplication is found, should be accepted, "cattari tthanani naro pamatto": occurs in Dhp 309 as follows:-
"cattari thanani naro pamatto apajjati paradarupasevi apunnalabhaip na nikamaseyyaiTi nindam tatiyam nirayam catuttham". 

In this case, we may note that the vutti expects the duplication of t, but Roman edition 16 ha5 no dublication of t which is not keeping with the vutti. We may accept the reading which contains the duplication of t as the vutti expects it. T reads ganhahi for **ganhati**. 

16. Even if in **Dhp** De the duplication is not shown.

Here ends the fourth section in the chapter on the sandhi. 

# Notes 1.4

This fourth section is mostly devoted to niggahitasandhi and covers twelve rules. **Buddhappiya** gives the meaning of niggahita and the method of its pronunciation as followss— "Spot bindu am after a voviel is called niggahita; having depended on a short vowel or having controlled the articulation **(karana)** it is grasped (pronounced); so it is called niggahita. Having controlled the articulator, it is pronounced with the mouth closed, following a vowel". 

According to Saddaniti "The sound used after vowels (a, i, u) and heard as am, im^ urn is called niggahita; such as a spot used after three short vowels in the following: **"ahain** kevattagamasmim ahum kevattadarako". It should be known as niggahita. But having depended on a short vowel it is grasped (and) pronounced 1. "am iti yam akarato param vuttam bindu, tam niggahitam nama hoti. Rassasaram nissaya gayhati, karanam niggahitva gayhati ti va niggahitam. 

"karanam niggahitvana mukhen'avivatena yam vuccate niggahitan ti vuttam bindu saranugam" Rup 6, 8-11. 

2 in the usages concerning the teaching (of the Buddha)" . 

A.P. **Buddhadatta** explains the niggahitasandhi as follows:- "When a word or a syllable ending in m is joined to a word or a syllable beginning either with a 
- 3 vowel or a consonant (niggahitasandhi takes place)" 
Kaccayana explains it in the present fourth section of the sandhi rules. According to Rupasiddhi, the rule 6 falls under sarasandhi, and 7 under byanJanasandhi, the rest under niggahitasandhi . 

In the fourth kanda, there are 12 rules, in the opening rule subject is **niggahitam,** but it is put at the end. This may be because the fruit of grammatical action is **ain** . In the following rule the word niggahitam is understood up to 33. In the rule 31 the word vagge occurs in the sense of secondary derivative as adjective of **byanjane** and therefore the word **byanjane** also is understood. 

2. "yam saddarupam am im um iti sarato param hutva suyyati , tain niggahitam nama bhavati, seyyathidam: **"aham** 
kevattagamasmim ahum kevattadarako" ti' cc adisu rassattayato parain bindu niggahitam nama ti datthabbant. 

Tarn pana sasanikapayogavasena rassasaram nissaya gayhati uccariyati ti niggahitan ti vuccati" **Sadd** 606, 17—23. 

3. **NPC** II p.3, see also EP6 p. 14, **PGP** p.6. 

T he word va is governin g up to 35 . In rule s 32 and 33 **byanjane** is understood , but **vagg** e is cancelled . 

In the rule 33 we have ca . Thi s ca stand s for ya in the rule 32 . If we compar e the rule s 19 and 20 from second kanda with the rules 32 and 33 in this kanda , we find that ca stands for the word occurin g in the precedin g rul e . 

T he word niggahit a is understoo d from the rule 30 , 
t he word sare cancels the preceding sa—ye . In the rule 35 niggahit a is not understood and the word ca indicate s sare . Here also Kaccayana use s ca for the word occurin g in the preceding rule . If we want to explai n ca differently , we may say that sound s ma and da are als o called agama-s in addition to their being substitute s for niggahita . 

In the rule 36 Kaccayana use s the word kvaci to cancel va from the rule 31 . In this special rule the vowel o is considered as agama . Similarl y in the following rule niggahit a also is considere d as agama , 
b ut in the rule 37 the word ca occur s whic h is grammaticall y significan t accordin g to the schem e of Kaccayana . We may say that ca stand s for byanjan e and n ot for kvaci , also becaus e in the rule 38 the word kvaci occurs again. It mean s in the rule 37 the word kvaci is not implied. Up to the rule 34 the word niggahit a was understood ; in the rule s 35 and 36 it wa s not understood. It again occurs to be understood from the rule 38 onwards. 

The rules 36 and 37 could not be united into single rule because the word kvaci is not understood in the rule 37. In the rule 39 ca stands for **lopam** 
occuring in the preceding rule. The word kvaci is continued in the rule 40- The word va cancels **kvaci.** 
The word **paro** is shorter than **niggahitamha** and therefore Kaccayana has prefered it. In the rule 40 , we have ca; this ca indicates additional grammatical operation. However, it could not be included in the previous rule, because in the rule 41 the word va is not understood. The field of application of va is limited and therefore it is used after kvaci. 

Rule Is "evam vutte"s occurs in **Vin III** 6,3 as follows:- "evam vutte veranjo brahmano bhagavantam etad a V o c a " . 

Rule 2s S2 adds **na nam duccaritan care** after **dhamman ca** sucaritam which occurs in **Dhp** 169 (v.l.) as followss-
"dhamman care sucaritam na nam duccaritam care dhammacari sukham seti asmim loke paramhi ca". 

In this context, S2 adds one more quotation. It 4 may be noted here that some **Dhp** versions do not show 
«\* 
the conjunct **nca,** but according to the rule, we must have nca which is keeping with the vutti. 

T, *^±f* ^2 read c**irampavasim** for ci**rappavasim**. 

"cirappavasim purisam": occurs in **Dhp** 219 as follows:— 
"cirappavasim purisaip durato sotthiro agatam 
*v _ 
natimitta suhajja ca abhinandanti agatam". 

In this context, we may remark as follows:— 
(1) According to the rule, we expect the change of niggahita into m. T and B^ quote **Dhp** 219 where the reading **cirampavasini** is expected, but we 'find pp in place of mp. 

(2) According to Saddaniti, the nasal m can be changed into p i.e. m -<- p > **pp.** 
(3) we may note here that, in oral tradition, - 
sim and -pu also can be Joined by changing niggahita into m; thus - **pavasimpurisam**. 

"santan tassa manam hoti": occurs in **Dhp** 96 as foilows:— 
"santam tassa manam hoti santa vaca ca kamma ca *v *v sammadannavimuttassa upasantassa tadino". 

In this context, we expect the change of niggahita into n as told by the vutti. But Roman edition of **Dhp** 
5. Even in **Dhp** De we find the reading cirappavasim. 

6. "po massa. "Cirappavasim purisam; hatthippabhinnam viya amkusaggaho" Sadd 623, 13-14, see also the vutti of I. 4.6, PM p. 48. 

does not show the change of niggahita into n . Therefore the reading which contains the change of niggahita into n e.g. **santan tassa** should be accepted. 

T adds **natham** after **tan karunikam, T, Bj^** , ^1 » Cd, S^ read **puggalam** for **pullingam.** By the force of **va** 
"option' occuring in this rule, we expect the change of niggahita into **la,** i.e. m -<- 1 > **1 1** e.g. **pum** -<- **lingam >** 
pullingam. In this case, **J.Minayeff** remarks: **"In the** 
words **sam, with; pum** man; the **niggahita** is assimilated to the following 1; ex. (1) **sallapo,** coversation; (2) 
Q 
pulliAgam, the masculine gender". The reading **puggalam** 
found in some versions is not applicable to the rule which the commentator wants to establish. **Saddaniti** 
and **lioggallana-vyakarana** also read **pullingam.** Therefore, the reading **pullingam** seems to be better as it is 
"na tarn kammam katam sadhu" : occurs in **Dhp** 67 as 7. Even in **Dhp** De the change of niggahita into n is not found. 

8. P8 p. 67, see also **PSP** p. 18, **NPC** II p. 22 , PM 
p. 49. 

"na tarn kammam katam sadhu yam katva anutappati yassa assumukho rodam vipakam patisevati". 

Rule 3! T, B^ read e—he **nam** for e—he **nnam.** The double n is not keeping with the vutti. Senart reads nakaram, and not nnakaram. However, the double lO 
n used in the example is applied to another rule. 

11 Buddhappiya also explains similarly 
"paccattan neva parinibbayissami": occurs in M I 
251, 31-252, 1 as follows:- "aparitassam paccattan neva parinibbayati". To correct the example in the vutti, we may replace -ssami by -seati. However, it does not concern the rule directly. "ten nev'ettha patipucchissami"! occurs in D I 60 , 3-5 as follows:- "tena hi maharaja tarn yev'ettha patipucchissami". In this case, we may remark that we expect the change of niggahita 9. "e—he ti ekam padam, nan ti ekam padan ti dvipam idam suttam" **Nyp** 47 , 6—7. 

1 0. "...imina ekara—hakare pare niggahitassa nakaram katva tassa **paradvebhavo thane** (1.3.6) ti dvebhavan ca katva parakkharam netva rupasiddhi veditabba" ibid., 
4 7, 20-22. 

1 1. "ekare hakare ca pare niggahitam kho nakaram pappoti va, ekare nadesassa dvibhavo" **Rup** 32,7—8. 

into n e.g. tam + eva > **tan neva.** Therefore, according 
-w *»» 12 to the rule the reading **tan nev'ettha** should be accepted in the place of **tam yev'ettha** which is not keeping with the rule. "evan hi vo bhikkhave sikkhitabbam" : occurs in M 1 126, *:Z7-'2'9* as followsi-
"dhammam yeva sakkaronto dhammam gurukaronto dhammam apacayamana suvaca bhavissama sovacassatam apajjissama ti evam hi bhikkhave sikkhitabbam". According to the rule, we expect the change of niggahita into n e.g. **evam** 
-*- hi > evan hi which is keeping with the rule to be 13 ~ -
explained in the vutti. "tan hi tassa musa hoti": 
occurs in Sn 757 (v.l.) as follows: - 
"yena yena hi mannanti tato tam hoti annatha tan hi tassa musa hoti mosadhammam hi ittarain' 
•V *** 
"evam etam abhinnaya": occurs in Sn 1115 (v.l.) 
"akincannasambhavam natva 'nandi samyojanam' iti evam etam abhinnaya tato tattha vipassati 
*** _ - -» 
etam nanam tatham tassa brahamanassa vusimato' ti Rule 4s The expression saye should be split as 1 2. In D I De we find the reading **tan nev'ettha** which is keeping with the rule to be explained in the vutti. 

13. In M I De n is not found. 

14 a shown by other versions. T, B^ , **Sj^** , S2» Cd , S read nakaram for **nnakaram.** This has been already discussed under the preceding rule. 

Rule Ss "tarn aham brutni brahmanam" : occurs in **Dhp** 385 as follows:-
"yassa parank aparam va paraparam na vijjati vitaddaram visannuttam tam aham brumi brahmanam". 

"etad avoca sattha": occurs in S I 220, 20-21 as follows:— "idam avoca bhagava. Idam vatvana sugato athaparam etad voca sattha". "akkocchi mam avadhi mam" and "ajini mam ahasi me": occur in **Dhp** 3 as quoted Rule 6s T, S2f read ~la for —la, the reading la is keeping with the example given by the vutti. T, B^, *S±t* S2 read ime in the place of **ima,** according to grammatical rule, the reading **ime** agrees with **agama** 
which is nom. mas. pi-* but **ima** is nom. fem. pl« 
Therefore, the reading **ima** should be corrected to **ime.** 
"na—y—imassa vijja": occurs in Ja II 316, 22—25 as follows: -
"na-y-imassa vijjamayam atthi kinci na bhandhavo no pana te sahayo atha kena vannena tiritavaccho tedandiko bhunjati aggapindain" . 

1 4. "sa iti ekain padam, ye iti ekam padam, ca ti ekam padan ti tipadam'idam suttam" **Nyp** 47 , 29—30. 

"yatha-y-idam cittam"s occurs in A I 5, 8—lO as follows:— "n'ahant bhikkhave annam ekad hammam pi samanupassami yam evain abhavitain akammaniyam hot:i yathay-idam cittam". "migi bhanta v'udikkhati"s occurs in Ja V 215, 12-13 as follows:-
"tada hi brahati sama amuttamanikunda1 a ekaccavasana nari migi bhanta v'udikkhati" . 

It may be noted here that B^ quotes from **Ja** 
V as the example of v augment, however, the commentary comments on **migi bhanta v'udikkhati** as "... sa uttamitthi tasmim khane mam udikkhanti bhayena vanam pavisitva puna nivattitva luddam udikkhanti bhantamigi 
'va mam udikkhati ti vadati" **CJa** V 216, 20-223-
According to it, the v is not augment. The commentator takes V of v'udikkhati as **iva** (just as) e.g. **migi** + 
iva > migi'va to which the rule 1.2.2. may be applied. In the foot-note Bj^ remarkss "udaharanam idam vicaretabbain (this example should be taken into consideration)". 

"sitta te 1 ahu —m —essati"s occurs in **Dhp** 369 as foilows:— 
"sinca bhikkhu imam navam sitta te 1ahu-m-essati 
_ __ »\r A* 
chetva ragan ca dosan ca 
^1» Sl» ^2 add asitta te before **garu—m-essati** . **S2** 
reads **bhaddo** for **bhadro,** both were in use. "asso bhadro kasa-m—iva": occurs in **Dhp** 143 A as followss— 
"hirinisedho puriso koci lokasmi vijjati yo nindam appabodhati asso bhadro kasa—m-iva". 

" samroa-d-annavimuttanain" I occurs in **Dhp** 57 as followss-
"tesain sampannasi 1 anain appamadavi har inain samma—d—anna vimuttanam maro maggam na vindati". 

"atta-d—attham abhinnaya": occurs in **Dhp** 166 as follows 5 - 
"atta—d—attharo paratthena bahunapi na hapaye atta—d—attham abhinnaya sadatthapasuto siya". 

T omits **yasma—t—iha bhikkhave.** 
"tasma-t-iha bhikkhave": occurs in S II 29, 8-10 as follows:— "tasma-t—iha bhikkhave viriyaro arabhatha appattassa pattiya anadhigatassa adhigamaya asacchikatassa sacchikiriyaya". 

The reading **panupeto** should be corrected to panupetam as it is in many versions. "ajja—t—agge panupetam": occurs in D I 85, 14-15 as follows:- "upasakam mam bhagava dharetu ajja—t—agge panupetam saranam gatam". T adds **saranam gato'smi** after ajja—t—agge panupetam. T quotes full sentence as found in D I. 

However, **gato'smi** should be corrected to **gatam.** "sabbhir-eva samasetha": occurs in S I 17, 3-4 as follows:-
"sabbhi-r-eva samāsetha sabbhi kubbetha santhavaṃ sataṃ saddhaṃṃaṃa seyyo hoti na pāpiyo".

"aragge-r-iva sasapo":   occurs in Dhp 401 as follows:-
"vāri pokkharapatte va āragge-r-iva sāsapo yo na lippati kāmesu tam ahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇaṃ".

"sasapo-r-iva aragga":  occurs in Dhp  407 as follows:-
"yassa rāgo ca doso ca māno makkho ca pātito ssssssse The  reading āragge should be corrected  to āraggā as in the Dhp 407.16  "cha-l-abhinna":  occurs in Bv II 203 as follows:-
"cattāri satasahassāni  cha-ļ-abhinnā mah'iddhikā dipankaram lokavidum parivarenti sabbada".

B1, S1 read sa-l-ayatanam for cha-l-ayatanam.

Whatever reading we may accept, both prove the rule of l augment.  "sa-l-āyatanaṃ":   occurs  in Vin  I  1,11  as follows:- "nāmarūpapaccayā sa-ļ-āyatanaṃ sa-ļ-āyatanapacayā phasso".

mah'iddhiyä":   occurs in Khp  VIII  
"evam 16 as follows:-
"evam mah'atthik" es" yad  idam  punnasampad" tasmā  dhīrā pasaṃsanti paṇḍitā katapunnataṃ",
This is quoted by T. It may be noted here that the reading mah'iddhiyā is found in all the  versions, but Roman
--------------
edition has **mah'itthika** which is based on thi commentary However, we find also the reading mah'iddhiya elsewhere in the Roman edition. We may accept either for, the absence of the augment between the two vowels is proved. 

"akkocchi mam avadhi mam" and "ajini mam ahasi me": occur in **Dhp** 3 as quoted under I.1.11 above. 

B^ reads anugamiko for anugamiyo. The reading anugamiyo found in some versions should be corrected to 
- 18 - 
anugamiko. "ajeyyo anugamiko": occurs in **Khp VII** 8 as foilows:— 
"eso nidhi sunihito ajeyyo anugamiko pahaya gamaniyesu etam adaya gacchati". 

"cirappavasim purisam": occurs in **Dhp** 219 as quoted under 1.4.2 above. "sadatthapasuto siya": occurs in Dhp *l&S* as quoted above. "sugato": occurs in **Vin III** 
1, 12-15 as quoted under 1.2.9. above. 

Rule 7s "atippago kho tava savatthiyam pindaya carituin": occurs in A IV 34, 27-35, 1-3 as follows:-
"atha kho ayasmato sariputtassa etad ahosi 'atippago kho tava savatthiyam pindaya caritum; yan nun aham yena annatitthiyanam paribbajakanam aramo ten'upasankameyyan' 1 7. **Nyp** also reads **mah'iddhiya. In Khp De** 
we find the reading **mah'itthika,** but the reading mah'iddhiya is not recorded in the foot—note. 

1 8. In **Khp** De we find the reading **anugamiko.** 
ti" . 

B^ omits **bhikkhusatain**. " parosahassam" : occurs in S I 192, 30-31 as followss-
" parosahassam bhikkhunain sugatain payirupasati desentam virajain dhammain nibbanam akutobhayam" . 

It may be noted here that the reading **bhlkkhusatam** in some versions seems to be close to the quotation from A 
IV. **Bhikkhusatam** should be corrected to **bhikkhunain.** 
"etha passath'imam lokam": occurs in **Dhp** 171 as fol1ows s - 
"etha passath' imam lokam cittam rajarath'upamam yattha bala visidanti n'tthi sango vijanatam". 

Bj^ reads **andhibhuto** for **andhabhuto.** "andhabhuto ayam loko"s occurs in **Dhp** 174 as follows:— 
"andhabhuto ayam loko tanuk'ettha vipassati sakunto jalamutto va appo saggaya gacchati". 

Rule 8: The semi-colon after **cakkhunt** should be put after **udapadi.** "cakkhum udapadi": occurs in Vin I, 
1 1, 1—3 as followss— "idam dukkham ariyasaccan ti me bhikkhave pubbe ananussutesu dhammesu cakkhum udapadi, nanain udapadi, panna udapadi, vijja udapadi, aloko udapadi". "avamsiro": occurs in Ja IV 103, 6—lO as foilows:— 
"idan ca sutva vacanam adhammo avamsiro patito uddhapado yuddhatthiko ce na labhami yuddhain ettavata hoti hato adhammo". 

T reads yavan c'idha bhikkhave purimaj atim, *^j,'* yavan c'idha bhikkhave purimam jatim sarami , Cd, Sj^ i **yavan** 
c'idha bhikkhave; purimamjati, ^2 **: yavan c'idam** 
bhikkhave; purimam j **ati** . T and **Bj^** give one example only e.g. **yavan** c'idha, they do not consider purimajatioi or purimam jatim as an example expected by the vutti. 

However, Cd, **Sj^** , S2 and **Senart** split the citation into two and give two examples e.g. **yavan c'idha** and 
- 19 purimamjati which seem to be closer to the original. 

The **word purimam** becomes the adjective of **jatim** (ace. 

sing.) . The rule expects the niggahita augment which anum- should be corrected to **anum.—**. "anumthulani sabbaso": occurs in **Dhp** 265 as follows:-
"yo ca sameti papani anumthulani sabbaso samitatta hi papanam samano ti pavuccati". 

"manopubbangama dhamma": occurs in **Dhp** 1 as quoted under 1.3.1 above. "idh'eva nam pasamsanti" and "pecca sagge ca modati": occur in Ja V 331, 9—10 as follows:— 
"taya nam paricariyaya matapitusu pandita idha c ' eva (nain) pasamsanti pecca sagge ca modati". 

"na hi etehi yanehi" and "gaccheyya agatam disaro"; 
occur in **Dhp** 323 as follows:— 
"na hi etehi yanehi gaccheyy a agatain disam yath'attana sudan'tena dant o danliena gacchatii". 

"paccessati ' or 'vicessati" : occur s in **Dhp** 4 4 as quotied under 1.3.2 above . 

Rule 9s "tas'aham santike" : occur s in **Vin** IV 235 , 28-2 9 as follows: - "tas'aham santik e brahmanacariya m carissa - 
mi B^ reads **etam atthain** for **etad a-ttham, T,B]^** read viditvan a for **viditva** , "etam attham viditva" : occur s in V in I 2 , 1-2 as follows: - 'atha kho bhagava etam attha m viditv a tayam velayam imam udanam udanesi" . The reading etad attham or **etam attham** may be accepted . The niggahit a is retained as exceptio n proved by this rule . 

Rule lO: "ariyasaccana dassanam " : occur s in **Khp** V lO 
as foilows: - 
"tapo ca brahmacariyan ca ariyasaccan a dassana m n i b b a n a s a c c h ik ir iya ca etain maiigalam uttamam " . 

"etam buddhana sasanam": occur s in **Dhp** 183 as follows: -
"sabbapapassa akaranam kusalass a upasampad a sacittapariyodapana m etam buddhana sasanam" . 

"etam mangalam uttamam" : occur s in **Khp** V 2 as foilows: - 
"asevana ca balanam panditanan ca sevana puja ca pu j aneyyanain etain mangalam uttamam" . 

T, Bj^ , **S]^**, S2 read **tarn vo vadami** , T reads bhadram vo, B^ s **bhaddan te** for **bhaddam vo,** "tarn vo vadami, bhaddam vo": occurs in Ja **III** 387, 21-22 as follows:— 
"tain vo vadami bhaddam vo yavant'ettha samagata sabbe katannuno hotha ciram saggamhi thassatha". 

The variant reading **bhaddan te** is also recorded. 

Here **Senart** omits **tarn** before **vo vadami,** but **tarn** should be prefixed to vo **vada<ni** , for, according to grammatical rule, the words **te, me,** vo, no are to be preceded by 21 other words. Therefore, the correction should be made as supported by many versions. 

Rule 11: T, Bj^ , Sj^ , S2» Cd read **abhinandun ti** for abhinandan ti, B^ reads **bhasitam** in the place of subhasitam and puts it before **abhinandun ti**, "bhasitam abhinandun ti": occurs in D I 46, 27-28 as follows:-
"idam avoca bhagava, attamana te bhikkhu bhagavato bhasitam abhinandun ti". **Senart's** reading should be corrected by shifting semi-colon of **uttam' va** after subhasitam. Further **abhinandun ti** should be accepted in the place of **abhinandan ti**. However, we find the reading abhinandan ti in some manuscripts 22 Here the reading 2 1. See II. 2. 28 and II. 2. 32. 

2 2. **Nyp** also reads **abhinandan ti.** In D I 46 (v.l.) 
the reading abhinandan ti is found. 

abhinandun ti or **abhinandan ti** proves the rule of the elision of the vowel preceded by the niggahita. But *B^* 
explains the canonical text more closely. 

B^ reads **uttam'va; yathabijam'va) yathadhannam'** 
va, T: uttam'va yatha bijam dhannam na ruhati seems to be a sentence composed by the vutti . Sj^ , Senarti uttam'va; yathabiJ am'va dhannam, S2: uttam' va; yathabi-
Jam'va; dhannam'va. *B^,* S2 give three examples which seem to be closer to the original. 

"etad ahosi": occurs in Vin **III** 12, 4-5 as follows:— "disvan'assa etad ahosi yam nun aham pi dhammam suneyyan ti". 

Rule 12s It may be noted here that keeping with visannogo in the rule, the reading **sannogo** found in T, Sj^ would be accepted for the vutti where Bj^ reads ssannogo. 

"evam'sa te asava": occurs in M I lO, 21-22 as follows:- "patisevato evam'sa te asava vighataparilaha na honti". "puppham'sa uppajji": occurs in Vin III 18, 14-16 as follows:- "atha kho ayasmato sudinnassa puranadutiyika na cirass'eva utuni ahosi, puppham' sa uppaj j i". 

^1' **^1'** ^2 *^^^^* **evam assa** in the place of **evam** 
assa vacaniyo. The reading **vacaniyo** should be corrected to **vacaniyo,** as discussed under I. 2.11. "evam assa" t occurs in **Vin III** 172, 33—34 as follows:— "so bhikkhu bhikkhuhi evam assa vacaniyo". 

T reads **agy agare** for **agy agaraoi** which occurs in Vin IV 109, 2 - 5 as followss— "upasantkami tva agy agaram pavisitva t inasan tharakain pannapetva nisidi pallakam abhujitva ujuin kayam panidhaya parimukham satim upatthapetva". The reading **agy agaram** is closer to the original. 

^1> ^2 *f^^^* **patisantharavuty ass** for **vuty assa.** 
"patisantharavuty assa": occurs in **Dhp** 370 as quoted under I.2.10 above.

Thi s fifth section is devoted to all combination s and cover s ten rules. In this section K a c c a y a n a does n ot classify sandhi in three groups . **Buddhappiy** a classifie s them as follows: - the rules 1-6 undes sarasandhi , 7,8,9 under byanjanasandhi . In the last rule dealing mainly with the inseparabl e prefixe s and indeclinable s etc. , Kaccayana intends to indicate the extended application of his system over and above the Sand h i - k a p pa with referenc e to vowel-junction s as well as consonantal junctions . Here **Buddhappiy** a classifie s the last rule under niggahitasandhi , There a re different methods of classificatio n of sandhi given by the grammarians as vi»ell as modern scholars , but in the entire discussion of Sandhi-kapp a belonging to the present study, we prefer to follow the method of classificatio n given by **Buddhappiya** . Prof . A.K. **Warder** 
remarks : "A detained study of **sandhi** in Pali would not yield any very definite criteria for textual criticism , 
since clearly the usage was very fluid in almost every 
!_ cl i>i=? alternatives existed either of whic h migh t be used at will by the poet"^ . 

In this last kanda , there are ten rules- Thi s kanda begins with the rule about a particula r expression , similarly the ne>;t rule also . In the rule 43 two grammatical operation s are combined with the us e of ca . However , a particula r expressio n only is proved . 

T he rule 44 is more wide , similarl y the rule 4 5 also ; 
both deal with prefixes . The rule 46 deal s wit h an exception . The expression **na va** cancel s **kvaci?** it mean s in the rules 44 and 4 5 **kvaci** was governing . However , in literature we do not find **abhi** and **adhi** withou t chang e when followed by a vowel othe r than i. This indicate s that **kvaci** should be applied only to the rules 4 2 and 43 . 

In the rule 47 the word ca stand s for **na va** . In the rule 48 kvaci cancel s **na va** which is applicabl e to a particular prefix. In the rule 49 the word **byanjan** e cancel s **i—vanne** occurinq in the rule 46 . In the rule 48 according to the vutti both **Bare** and **byanjan** e *ar<B* 
understood . This , however , is not keeping wit h the Kaccayana' s arrangement of the rules . Similarl y in the rule 49 **kvaci** seems to be continued , because it is no t cancelled even in the rule 50 which also is applicabl e to a particular prefi>;. The rule 51 close s thi s S a n d h i-k a p p a and therefore , it cover s all c o n j u n c t s whic h are not accomplished in the first kappa . 

Regarding the arrangemen t of the rules F. **Maso** n point s out ; "Kachchayano' s treatis e on Permutatio n is mor e unsatisfactory than any other part of his grea t work , because no rule is absolute . Nearly every rule h as an opposite one to counterac t it . Like the centripetal and centrifugal forces , they balanc e eac h other and the student is left in **statu quo** . On e aphorism says : "When a vowel procede s a consonant , it remain s unchanged sometimes; " another : "It is lengthened sometimes; " a third: "It is shortened sometimes; " and a fourth : "It is elided sometimes" . Even if the arrangemen t of some rules composed by Kaccayan a is defectiv e as pointed out by **Mason** , in the field of Pali grammar Kaccayana - **v y a k a r a na** is considere d as the oldes t o ne and very significant for one who want s to learn the Tipitaka in order to understan d it perfectly . 

Rule 2 : T, S2 read **c'anto** for **c'anto** . 

"pageva" : occurs in Ja **III** 111 , 19-21 as follows: - 
" e V a m e v a m a n u s s e s u y o h o t i 5 e 11 h a 5 a m m a t o BD ce adhammam carati pag eva itara paja 5 a b b a (T! r a 11 h a m d u k k h a m 5 e t i raja c e h o t i d h a m m i k o " .

It may be noted here that Bj^ has given the quotation s from **Jataka,** and **Vinaya** ; they suppor t the rule about **pag eva** and **pa eva** only . **Fag eva vuty assa** 
or **pa eva vuty assa**, seem s to be a sentenc e composed by t he vutti in order to give an exampl e for this rtile.

Rule 4: B^^ read **ajjh'okas** e for ajjh'okaso , T read s ajjh'aggam **a Bj^ lajjh'agama** for **ajjh'agama** . The changin g of **abhi** into **ajjha** has been proved , but the reading s ajjh'okas e and **ajjh'agama** seem to be closer to the 4 -
original . "ajjh'okase": occur s in **Vin** IV 39 , 14-17 as follows: - "tena kho pana samayena bhikkhu heman t i ke kale a r o c i t e t a m p a k k a m a n t a n ' e v a u d d h a r i ip 5 u n a u d d h a r a p e 5 u JTI a n a p u c c h a p a k k a m i m 5 u " .

The end of the first section in the chapter on the nama (declension). 

## Notes Ii.L.

This first section of nama (noun) covers 68 rules. 

Aggavamsa gives the meaning of the noun as: "The wise men say: "which way (pada) makes the others to **bring the** 
meanings in itself or it tends towards the meaning by itself, thus it is called nama". **Buddhappiya** says : 
"It is called nama due to tending towards the meaning and bringing the meaning in itself, i.e. the designation 2 of matter". Noun has been divided into five kinds as follows:- (1) Buddhanama or **namanama** (simple nouns or substantives and proper nouns) (2) **sabbanama** (pronouns) 
(3) **samasanama** (compound nouns) **(4) taddhitanama** 
(derivatives from nouns or substantives) (5) **kitanama** 
3 -
(verbal derivatives). According to **Rupasiddhi,** noun is twofold: (1) **anvatthanama** (noun according to the sense or fact) (2) **rulhinama** (noun grown by tradition or general acceptance); it is threefold: (1) **masculine (2)** 
feminine (3) neuter e.g. rukkho (tree) **mala** (garland) 
and **dhana** (wealth); it is fourfold: (1) **samannanama** 
(common noun)

3. GPL p. 21, **NPC** I p. 48. 

(2) **gunanama** (adjective noun> (3) **kiriyanama** (the noun of the action) **(4) yadicchanama** (the noun used according to one's own wish) e.g. **rukkho** (tree), **nilo** (blue), pacako (a cook) , and **sirivaddho** (proper noun) etc. It is eightfold: **avannantapakatinama** (noun ending in a or **a )** , 
ivannantapakatinama (noun ending in i or i) **, uvanna—** 
ntapakatinama (noun ending in u or u) , okarantapakatinama (noun ending in o) and **niggahitantapakatinama** (noun ending in a m ) . 

In the beginning Kaccayana states that the rules of Pali grammar *stre* keeping with the discourses of Lord Buddha. Genders, case—endings and numbers are related to each other. In Pali grammar there are three genders 
(masculine, feminine, neuter) or two kinds of geders, namely: (1) **atthalinga** (the gender with respect to the 5 sex) (2) **saddatthalinga** (the grammatical gender); two numbers (singular and plural) and eight case—endings 
(the nominative, the accusative, the instrumental, the 4. "tarn pana duvidam anvattharulhivasena; tividham pumitthinapumsaka1ingavasena; yatha: rukkho, mala,

dative, the ablative, the genitive, the locative and the vocative). Kaccayana divides only seven cases and does not consider the vocative which he calls alapana as an independent case but as included in the nominative. In the rule 55 he begins the declensions by giving the lists of case-endigs for each number and every case. He gives one set of terminations, so according to his grammar, Pali has only one declension. 

In the rules 57, 113, 115 he has laid down the technical term ga which stands for si case-ending of vocative. In the rules 58, 70 , 71 , 82 , 96, 97 , 116, 117, 119 he deals with the techinical terms jha- la which stand for i or u (short or long). In the rules 5 9, 68 , 72 , 82, 112, 118 he has laid down the technical term pa (of feminine) which stands for i or u (short or long). In the rules 60, 66, 111, 114,118 he had laid down the technical term **gha** (of feminine) which sti?nds for a. In the rules 61-65, 83-85, 88 , 89, 99, 100-104, 107—llO he deals with the declensions of nouns and pronouns in different endings. In the rules 67 , 
8 6, 87 , 90 he deals with numeral adjectives. In the rules 73-81 he deals with the word go which has an irregular declension. In the rule 69 he adds the vowel o to signify the locative after the word adi of an irregular form- In the rule 91 he adds the Buffix **ini** as a mark of feminine gender. In the rules 92—94 he deals with the possessive adjectives which have irregular declension. In the rule 95 he adds the word **ini** after **aggi** to indicate the nominative case. In the rule 98 he has laid down the suffix i which is changed into **ani** after a particular word. In the rule 105 he deals with the forms of the instrumental case as an exception. In the rule 106 he deals with the ablative case after a particular word. 

In the first kanda , there are 68 rules. The first rule is governing rule which is made of two words where hi is nipata. **Jinavacanayuttam** seems to be adjective of akkharapadam and nipata hi seems to be connected with the kappa, according to **Nyasapatha. We** may compare this with opening rule in Akhyata-kappa which begins with the word **atha** because the words hi and **atha** have no direct connection with the grammatical operation. In second rule we have the word **ca.** According to Rupasiddhi the word ca indicates addition of dhatu. According to the arrangement of Kaccayana the word ca may stand for **jinavacanayuttam** occuring in the opening rule. 

In the third one again we have the word **ca.** 
Nyasapatha and **Rupasiddhi** have different interpretations of ca . 8 In the rule 56 the words **lingam** and **nipaccate** are understood and the word **tam** stands for **jinavacanam**. Thus the rules 52-3-4 and 56 are the general rules regarding the nominal declension according to Kaccayana. The rule 57 lays down a technical term; similarly the following rules up to 60 are concerned with technical terms. 

These general grammatical terms are included in this particular kappa because these are concerned with nominal formations. In the rule 62 the word **ca** 
stands for **sagamo** in the preceding rule. In the rule 65 the word **tato** stands for ta, **eta, ima** occuring in the rules 63—64. In the rule 67 the word ca occurs. 

According to Kaccayana's arrangement the word ca stands for the word **agama** occuring in the rule 61. In the rule 68 the word va is used again because the word va in the rule 64 is discontinued in the rule 66. 

In the rule 69 the word ca stands for am in the rule 6 8. However, the word a also should continue from the rule 68. In the rule 69 the word **va** 
also is understood from the rule 68. But in the 8. "casaddo atthavisesam dipeti; ayanh'etth'a11ho , tato ca vibhattiyo honti; ta ca pana caggahanena ekavacana— 
"V 
bahuvacana-pathama-dutiya—tatiya-catutthi—pancami—chatthi 
-sattamisannam labhanti ti" **Nyp** 71, 1—3, "casaddarule 70 again the word va occurs; it means va should not be understood in the rule 69. In the rule 71 the words va and **sare** are understood from the rule 70. However, in Sis B^, Cd, T the word va is not understood. In the rule 70 there is the word va. In the rule 71 we have the word ca; it means that the word ca stands for **sare** 
and therefore the word va is not understood. But in the rule 72 we have the word ca again,this means the word ca may not be understood in the rule 71, and therefore in the **Srilankan** Mss of vutti the word ca is absent-
According to the rule 72 only the y substitute is understood from the rule 71. 

Thus the rules 71 and 72 become important from the point of view of the arrangement of the rules. In the rule 75 the word ca stands for addition to **ava** 
occuring in the rule 73. In the rule 78 the word ca stands for **ava** occuring in the rule 75. In the rule 79 the word ca occurs for the word o in the rule 78. In the rule 80 the word va occurs in the place of the word ca. However, the word go is understood from the rule 73 onwards. In the rule 81 the word ca stands for **gona** 
occuring in the rule 80 . From the rule 82 the word **go** 
discontinues. In the rule 83 the word tu is used to indicate additional information, that is **pakatibhava.** 
In the rule 84 we have both the words **api** and ca. 

According to the vutti the word ca is for **avadharana** and the word api is for option. In the rule 85 it is used for exception. In the rule 88 the grammatical operation is **digham** which cancels the word **rassam** occuring in the rule 84 ; the word **sara** is understood . In the rule 89 the word ca stands for **digham.** In the rule 92 we have the word ca which stands for **attam** in the rule 90 , 
but this is also understood in the rule 91 in which the word ca is absent. This is not keeping with the usual style of Kaccayana. Similarly, in the rule 94 the word va is used which should have been continued from the rule 93. In the rule 95 also the word va is understood, but in the rule 96 it is discontinued. 

In the rule 97 the word ca stands for **attain** from the rule 90. The rule lOO is exception for the rule 9 9. In the rule 102 the word ca occurs for e in the preceding rule. In **the** rule 105 the word **na vacanassa** 
is understood which does not occur in the preceding rule. In the rules 106 and 107 the word va seems to be understood. However in the rule 108 again the word **va** 
is used. This seems to be not keeping with the general arrangement of the rules. In the rule i09 the word tu is used which seems to be for recording exception. It probably indicates that the word **aya** is used in a particular meaning. In the rule liO the word ca stands for **ato** occuring in the rule 103. In the rule 114 the word ca stands for e and the word va is cancelled. It is significant that in the rule 118 the word ca stands for jha—lato occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 119 the word ca stands for **yonain** occuring in the preceding rule. 

Rule 2: yathayatha and **tathatatha** in the entire discussion should be split in **yatha yatha** and **tatha**

Bj^ , T, Sj^ read **saddhaya** for **sabbaya.** B^ reads **sobhaya**

According to the rule, the ending a (feminine gender) is required, but **sotaya** and **kapalaya** have masculine and neuter genders. " Therefore, Bj^ reads **sobhaya** and kapalikaya which have a endings of feminine gender as expected by this rule. 

Rule 11: Sj^ adds **dandina** after **panina.**

Regular form should be **purisehi** and **purisesu** according to the rule I I .1.50. However, **KPG** gives two forms of the instrumental and locative case in the plural

(38) Also (the final vowel of the word puma) followed by the ease—ending hi. 

When the case-ending hi follows, the final vowel of the word puma becomes ane. Thus: 'pumanehi' 'pumanebhi'. Why does the word vibhatti (case-ending) occur again? So that ' non-inc1usion of case —ending' may be prevented. By the force of the word ca (also), the final vowel of the words **maghava** and **yuva** etc. followed by the case—endings si, yo, am and yo, is changed into **ana;** and when the case-endings sa and **sma** follow, the final vowel of the words **puma, kamma** and **thama** is also changed into u.

The end of the second section in the chapter on the nama. 

# Notes Ii.2

This second section of nama (noun) covers 41 rules. In the rules 120, 121, 129, 130, 139, 140-151 the grammarian deals with the declensions of pronouns in different forms. In the rules 122-128 he has laid down the suffix **ntu** to form the possessive adjective. 

In the rules 131—134 he deals with the numeral adjectives. In the rules 135-138, 152-159 he deals with irregular nouns of different forms. In the rule 160 he deals with the word **kamma** which has irregular forms with u and a in the instrumental case singular. 

In this second kanda, there *are* 41 rules. In the opening rule the word **sabbassa** is understood which we may take from the rule 107 from the preceding kanda. 

This **sabbassa** is continued up to 130. The word **ntussa** 
is continued from the rule 122 up to 128. In the rule 126 the word ca stands for am occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 129 the word va is understood from the preceding rule. The word **napumsake** is discontinued from the rule 126 up to 128 and therefore it is again introduced in the rule 129 which is continued in the rule 130 also. The rule 131 is governing rule because up to the rule 134 the numerals *are* treated. In the rule 132 Kaccayana uses the word ca. This ca is interpreted in the vutti in order to suit other expressions. In the rule 134 the word **antasarassa** is understood by implication of the expression **akaro.** 
From the rule 135 Kaccayana treats the forms of a particular noun. In the rule 137 the word va is used by Kaccayana even if it was available in the preceding rule. This is not keeping with the general arrangement of Kaccayana's rules. However, we may say that this indicates that option is not applicable to the rule 13S. 

In the rule 140 Kaccayana uses the word ca which according to the vutti indicates **tuvant**. However, according to Kaccayana's arrangement, the word ca stands for **tumh'amhakaip** occuring in the preceding rule, but the word **tumh' amhakant** is understood up to 145. 

Therefore the word ca is not necessary in the rule 140. 

In the rule 142 the word ca stands for se in the preceding rule. In the rule 144 the word ca stands for amhi occuring in the preceding rule. The word padato occuring in the rule 147 is understood up to 151. In rule 148 the word va given by B^ stands for catutthichatthi from the rule 147. In the rule 150 the word ca stands for te, me occuring in the rule 148. In the rule 150 the word ca cancels na in the preceding rule. From the rule 152 up to 159 Kaccayana deals with a particular noun and the last rule of the kanda accomplishes the forms of the word kamma. In the rule 160 the word ca stands for u occuring in previous rule, whereas the word ca in the rule 159 stands for a in the preceding rule, therefore, Kaccayana uses the word ca in both 159 and 160. 

Rule is T, S add **amhasse ti kirn attham? Purisassa** 
diya'te. Se ti kim attham? Aham gacchami, ntayain gacchama 
(why the word **amhassa?**: For, in the following example this change is not found: 'purisassa diyate'. Why the case—ending **sa?:** For, in the following examples this change is not founds 'aham gacchami; mayam gacchama) 
after pariggaho. 

Rule 3: T reads **passasi Sj^** » *^2'* passanti Bj^ : passanti jana for passatha, whatever reading we may accept, the reading **passanti** seems to be closer to the original. 

Rule 4: B^, T add va after **silavato jhayino** which seems to be significant, that is? **either silavantassa or** 
silavato is found. "si 1avantassa" : occurs in **Dhp** 110 as foilows:— 
"yo ca vassasatam jive dussilo asamahito ekahain jivitam seyyo silavantassa jhayino". 

Rule 5: *^i.r ^2r* **^1 » ^** add **balava** and **Bj^** adds dhanava . 

d hi t imf in the vutti. *Sj^,* S2, T read **puriso** 
The reading puriso 2 titthati for **purisa titthanti.** - • *' mm* titthati is closer to the original.*" "satima":

"dvayam": occurs in **Vin III** 21 , 1—4 as follows: - "tattha nama tvam moghapurisa yam tvam asaddhamma m gamadhamfnain vasadhammaip dutthuilam odakantika m rahassa dvaya m dvayasamapatti m samapajjissasi" . "ubhinnafp":occurs in Ja I **353** , 13—14 as follows! - "ubho khanja ubho kuni ubho visamacakkhuk a ubhinna m pilaka jata n'aham passami illisam". 

Rule 14 **: T, Sj^ , S2» B^ read ayatanani** for **asavani** 
"tisso vedana" : occurs in D **III** 216 , 20-21 as followsi -
"tisso vedana . Sukha vedana , dukkha vedana , adukkha—ma s u k h a vedana" . "tayo jana"s occur s in Ja **III** 528 , 1518 as fo11owsI -

Rule IS: Bj^ T add va katain, Sj^ , ^2 ' *"^^* **katam kammain** 
after rajena. Bj^ , Sj^ , *^2'* ^ read **santakam** for santi k a m. 

Rule 21 **: Bj^ , Sj^ , S2** add simhi ti kim attham ? Tayi **, may** ! 

(why the case-ending si? : For , in the followin g example s this change is not found : 'tayi' 'mayi') after tvam, aham."tuvam sattha" : occur s in Sn 571 as follows: - 
"tuvam buddho tuvam sattha tuvam marabhibhu muni tuvam anusaye chetva tinno tares'imam pajam" . 

Rule 28 : All the version s record **yada** (the rules 29-3 2 also ) before **padasma.** In this case , we may remark that the reading **yada** is not keeping with the contex t of the vutti , because the words ya and ta *Are* alway s related to each other in a sentence . However , in this contex t even 
_ _ 4 _ 4 - 4 Nyasapatha **, Rupasiddhi** and **Saddaniti** 
omi t it . 

Therefore , the reading **yada** should be cancelled . If we retain the reading **yada** in the vutti , **tada** should be added before **vo-no-adesa honti** as suggested by S u t taniddesapa t h a . " *S^^ S^r* T omit **bhikkhav** e after pahaya vo, even the citation omits it. "pahaya vo bhikkhave gamissami": occurs in Ap 584, 19 - 20 as foilDws:— 
"paripakko vayo mayham parittam atha jivitam pahaya vo gamissami katam me saranam attano". 

vikantisu should be corrected to **vikantimsu** as shown in all the versions, "ma no ajja vikantimsu": occurs in Ja V 368, 15—16 as followsz— 
"ma no ajja vikantimsu ranno suda mahanase tatha hi vanno pattanam phalam velum va tam vadhi". 

B^ , T add **ranno suda mahanase** after **vikantiinsu.** In this case, we may remark that the additional reading given by BjL , T is not concerned with the e>:ample expected by the vutti, but ^l? T give it in order to make the meaning complete as shown in the citation. Bj^ adds **evam** dutiy'atthe (thus, it is used in the sense of the accusative case). "dhammam vo bhikkhave desissami"i occurs in M **III** 280, 18-20 as follows:- "dhammam vo bhikkhave desissami adikalyanam majjhe kalyanam pariyo— 
. •'\jsanakalyanam sattham sabyanjanam keva1aparipunnam parisuddham brahmacariyam pakasissami". "samvibhajetha no rajjena": occurs in D II 233, 13-14 as followsi-

Rule 29 I T and B^ read te —m'ek**avacanesu** for te —**ro'ek** - 
avacane but *Bj^* adds ca after it in the rule which Sut**taniddesapatha** intrepretes as "supplying the word catutthi—chatthi from the preceding rule". "dadami te 
_ 'V 
gamavarani panca": occurs in Ja IV 99, 3—6 as follows:-
"dadami te gamavarani panca dasisatam satta gavam satani parosahassan ca suvannanikkhe bhariya ca te sadisi dve dadami".

"idan te rattham sadhanatn sayoggam sakayuram eabbakamupapannam idan te rajjam anusasa amma gaccham'aham yattha piya pabhavati". 

Rule 30s **passeya** should be corrected to **passeyya** as shown in many versions. "passeyya tam vassasatam arogyam": occurs in Ja V 495, 27—30 as follows:-
"ariyaesa ariyena sameti sakkhi pannassa pannanavata sameti passeyya tarn vassasatam arogam etam varanam pathamam varami". 

The reading **abruvi** should be corrected to **braviti** 
as shown in B;^ , T. We need to construct this example in the past tense as suggested by **Senart.** We find the form **abravi** Cnot **abruvi]** in the **Saddaniti (dhatumala).** 
In this case, B2 has constructed the example in the past tense i.e. **so mam'abravi.** We may correct **abruvi** 
into abravi as **B2- Rule** 32: T reads **papam** for **kammam.** 
The readings **gaccheyatha** and **gaccheyama** should be corrected to 7. Sadd 422, 25. 

gaccheyyath a and **gaccheyyama** respectively as shown in all the versions . 

Rule 35s The **reading itthipumannapumsakan** i should be added after **napumsakam** as shown in some versions . The reading **itthipuma-** should be shortened as **itthipuma** ,

The case —ending yo is also changed into ain and anant. 

For example 'tumham' 'tumhanam' 'amham' 'amhanam'. 

C33 Sassa'm. 163 Tehi tumh'amhehi sassa vibhattissa am —adeso hoti va .

## C4] Sabbanam'Akarate Pathamo. 164

Sabbesam sabbanamanam akarato yo pathamo ettam apajjate. Sabbe; ye; te; ke; tumhe; amhe; ime. Sabbanamanam iti kim atthaip? Deva; asura; naga; gandhabba. 

Akarato ti kim attham? Amu purisa. Yo ti kim attham?

(4) After pronouns ending in a, the first case-ending yo is changed into e. 

The first case - ending yo used after a of all pronouns becomes e. For example 'sabbe' 'ye' 'te' *ke' 
'tumhe' *arohe' *ime'. Why the pronouns? For, in the following examples this change is not found: 'deva' 
'asura' 'naga' 'gandhabba'. Why used after a?: For, in the following example this change is not found: 'amu purisa'. Why the case-ending yo?: For, in the following examples this change is not found:'sabbo' yo' 
'ko' 'ayam'. The word **pathamo** is used in view of the following rule. Thus: 'kataro ca katamo ca: 
katarakatame or katarakatama'. 

C53 Dvandattha va. 165 Tasma sabbanamanam akarato dvandattha yo pathamo ettam apajjate va. Katarakatame; katarakatama. Sabbanamanain iti kirn attham? Devasuranagagand habbamanussa .

C63 **Nannam** sabbanamikam. **166** 
Sabbanamikavidhanam dvandatthe nannam kariyam hoti. 

Pubbo ca aparo ca: pubbaparanam; pubbo ca uttaro ca: 
pubbottaranam; adharo ca uttaro cas adharottaranam.

(42) The word satthu, followed by the case—ending nam, is optionally changed into a. 

When the case—ending nam follows, the (final of the) 
word satthu optionally becomes a. For example 'satthanam' 'pitanam' 'matanam' 'bhatanam' 'dhitanam' 'kattanam' . Why optionally?: For, in the following examples this change is not found: 'sattharanam' 'pitunam'

The end of the third section in the chapter on the nama. 

# Notes Ii.3

This third section of nama (noun) covers 50 rules. 

In the rules 161-164, 168, 170-180, 210 the grammarian deals with the pronouns of different forms. In the rules 165-167 he has treated the particular compounds. 

In the rules 169, 188-198 he deals with the declensions of irregular nouns. In the rules 181-184 he deals with the declensions of nouns (the group of **mana** etc.) by adding sa augment. In the rule 185 he deals with a particular word **santa.** In the rules 186—187 he deals with the declensions of present participles. In the rules 199—209 he deals with the declensions of nouns by adding ra. 

In this third kanda, there are 50 rules. The kanda begins with pronominal derivation. In the rule 164 the word **sabbanama** is used which is governing up to 168. 

The rule 166 is a general rule laid down for prohibition of certain grammatical process which is applicable to the rule 167 also. The word ca occuring in the rule 167 is significant according to the arrangement of the rules. The word ca here is e>;pected to indicate the prohibition of certain grammatical process. However, there is not a particular single word which may be substituted by the word ca and therefore the vutti takes this ca to indicate the word va, but it is not keeping with the literary style of Pali grammatical sutta - s. 

In the rule 168 the word **sabbato** seems to be adjective of the word **sabbanamato** which may be taken from the rule 164. However, in the rule 164 also the word **sabbato** is implied and therefore the word **sabbato** 
occuring again in the rule 168 becomes significant. In the rule 169 single noun is treated. This rule also has the word ca which stands for **sabbassa** from the word sabbato in the preceding rule. From the rule 170 up to 172 the pronoun **ima** is treated. In the rule 170 the word **sabbassa** is used. It means it was not available in the preceding rule and therefore, the word ca in the rule 169 may not be taken for **sabbassa**. And therefore in the vutti under the rule 169 the word ca is taken for **avadharana.** Similarly, the vutti under the rule 171 takes the word ca for **va—ggahananivattana**. 

According to the style of Kaccayana the word ca in the rule 171 may stand for **imassa** in the preceding rule. 

It also at the same time cancels the word va in the preceding rule. 

In the rule 175 the word **sabbattha** indicates all the genders as against the word **anapumsakassa** occuring in the rule 172. However, the word **sabbattha** may better be taken in the sense of all cases, because in the rule 176 particular cases only are referred to as against the word **sabbattha.** From the rule 181 a particular word gona is treated up to 184. In the rule 182 the word ca is used which indicates according to the vutti inclusion of some other cases. However, according to general arrangement of the rules the word ca may represent the word **manoganadito** occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 185 the word ca indicates additional grammatical operation. In this rule, the word **sadda** is used in the sense of the word **sabbassa** which is significant. Kaccayana here refers to the word **saddassa** 
because in the preceding rule the word **sabbassa** is not understood. The following two rules *str-e* composed to treat other gana-s. In the rule 186 again the word sadda is used to indicate particular portion of a word. 

The use of the word **sadda** is significant. 

In the rule 1S8 up to 198 another group of words is treated. In the rule 1S9 the word ca stands for brahmaatta-sakha-rajadito occuring in the preceding rule. The vutti does not explain this **ca. Nyasapatha** indicates the stylistic sense and cancels the word va from the previous rule. Again in the rule 191 the word ca is used to indicate the word **yonam** occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 193 the word ca stands for e in the preceding rule. In the treatment of the word sakha, the treatment of the word **brahma** seems to be mixed up. This is due to the arrangement of the rules based on brevity. In the rule 195 we have the word va which is repeated in the ne>:t rule which is significant according to the general arrangement of the rules. The word va was not necessary in the rule 196. Even the rules 195 and 196 could have been merged into a single rule. 

In the rule 197 the word tu is used which cancels the word va in the preceding rule. In the rule 198 the word **anta55a** is understood from the rule 194. From the rules 199 to 203 another group of nouns is treated- In the rule 199 the word ca indicates additional grammatical operation. The word **anto** is continued from the previous treatment. In the rule 202 the word ca stands for **namhi** in the preceding rule. In the rule 203 the word ca indicates additional grammatical operation. 

In the rule 204 another group of nouns is treated where the word ca stands for both the grammatical operations told in the previous rule. In the rule 20 5 the word tato means after the substitute a told in the rule 195 which is also understood up to 207. This reference to a is made after the group **sakamandhatu** etc. Therefore, the word tu is used to cancel the word ca in the previous rule. But it is difficult to explain why the word **tato** is repeated in the rule 206. The rule 210 seems to be added after the main arrangement of the third kanda because it deals with a particular form of a pronoun. 

Rule 4: T reads **nara** for **naga. B^** adds **manussa** after gandhabba. Bj^ , T add **titthanti** after **purisa.** Sj^ , S2» 
2 Bj^ , T add 50 after yo. 

Rule 5: S^ adds **kataro ca katamo ca** before **katarakatamo** 
Va should be added after **katarakatama** as shown in all the versions. T reads **devasuranaragarudanagagandhabba** 
for **devasuranagagandhabbamanussa.** 
Rule 6: nannam (in the vutti of the following rule also) should be corrected to **nannam** as shown in all the versions. Si » ^2» Cd read **pubba ca apara ca"^** 
and **pubba ca uttara ca** for **pubbo ca aparo ca and pubbo** 
ca uttaro ca. ^i j *^1* ^"2** ^ read **pubbu t taranam** for pubbot taranam. Bj^ , **Sj^** , S2 read **adharut taranam** for adharottaranam. 

Rule 7: Sj^ , S2 read **yassa sa** for **yassa,** whatever reading we may accept, however, after **yassa** the reading so, sa or **tarn** should be added as the usual analysis of Bahubbihi compound. Hence the pronoun can be declined in three genders as an adjective according to the gender of the dominating noun. Rule 8: All the versions add **kassa** in the vutti. 

Rule 10: B^ adds ebhi, **imebhi, etebhi** after ehi, **imehi**, 
etehi respectively. 

Rule 11: The reading **honti** should be corrected to **hotu** 
as shown in all the versions, because the subject 
(**sa paja)** is a singular, so the verb should agree with the subject. T reads **buddhatejena** for buddhapu j ena. **Bj^** 
adds **imebhi** after **imehi.** 
Rule 12s T adds **ayam raja** after puriso. T, Bj^ , **Sj^** , **S2** 
4 add **titthati** after cittam.

Rule 14: etesv iti should be corrected to **eta—tesam'** iti as shown in all the versions. Anapumsakass'eti should be corrected to anapuinsakanaiii' **i t** i as shown in the vutti itself and other versions. 

Rule 15: Sj^ , S2, T, B^ add **nabhi"^** after **tabhi** in the vutti. "nam": occurs in Sn 199 as follows:-
"ath'assa susiram sisam ma11ha 1ungassa puritam subhato nam mannati balo avijjaya purakkhato".

Rule 19: "imiBBa": occurs in **vibh** 245, 27-28 as follows:— "idha ti: imissa ditthiya imissa khantiya imissa ruciya imasmim adaye...". "amussa": occurs in M 
II 224, 4-6 as follows:-
"aham kho amussa itthiya saratto patibaddhacitto tibbacchando tibbapekkho"-
Rule 21: S j^ , ^2 j Bi add **sarasa, sarena** after **sirena.** 
"manasi": occurs in D I 13, 11—14 as follows:— "idha bhikkhave ekacco saroano va brahmano va atappam anvaya padhanam anvaya an uy ogam anvaya appamadant anvaya samma -

'V 
yunjiyamano samanugahiyamano samanubhasiyamano tad eva papakam ditthigatam thamasa paramassa abhinivissa voharati "-
Rule 22s S2 J Bj^ add **thamaso** in the vutti. S^ adds casaddaggahanena 'abyaggamanaso naro'ti adisu manasaddato siss'okaradeso hoti; evam yamhi yamhi kate yain yam sijjhati, tarn tain idha casaddena katabbam. Abyaggam manain yassa so abyaggamanaso. But S2 reads sisso for siss' **okar adeso** and adds manasa pakatain manomayam; sesakaradeso hoti after **abyaggamanaso**. It may be noted here that by the force of the word **ca,** si case-ending used after the word **mana** can be changed into o e.g. **abyaggamanaso naro** (the man whose mind is not confused), that is, the nominative case singular of mana is sometimeB made **manaso (mana + si > manaso, s** augment has been added according to the rule II. 3- 24) . This proves the exception of this rule. The additional vutti is according to **Nyasapatha** which has been followed by S2- "manaso": occurs in Vv i07 as follows:— 
"tena m'etadiso vanno tena me idha—m—ijjhati uppajjanti ca me bhoga ye keci manaso piya". 

Rule 23: **Bj^** , S2 read **siroruhena** for **siroruho,** *S^* 
adds **keso** after **siroruho.** The reading **siroruhena** is closer to the original. "manomayam": occurs in D I 77 , 6—9 as follows:- "so evam samahite citte parisuddhe pariyodate anangane vigat'upakki1ese mudubhute kammaniye thite anejjappatte manomayam kayam abhinimminaya cittam abhiniharati abhininnameti".

"tapasa": occurs in Pv 8 as quoted under II. 3. 21. 

"yasasa": occurs in Vv 852 as quoted under II. 3. 21 above, "vacasa": occurs in A II 185, 5-7 as quoted under 6. See **Sadd** 163, 22, **Sdp** 71, lO-ll 7- See **Nyp** 160, 10-13. 8. **Nyp** also reads siroruhena. 

II. 3. 21 above, "manasa": occurs in Dhp 1 as quoted under 1.3.1. Rule 24: ntadena should be corrected to manena as shown in all the versions. Sj^ , S2 prefix manasa pakatam kammain before manasikam and vacasa pakatam kammam before vacasikam which occurs in Vibh 246, lO-ll as follows:— 
"kayiko avitikkamo vacasiko avitikkamo kayikavacasiko avitikkamo". 

Rule 25: nasabbhi should be corrected to santhavam as shown clearly in some versions and in the citation. ^i» 
S^, S2 add 
'\x ^V 
"satam saddhamm'annaya seyyo hoti na papiyo" in order to quote the full form occuring in S I 17, 3—4 as quoted under I, 4.6. Sj^, *^2.' ^1* have

"jiranti ve rajaratha sucitta atho Sarirampi jaram upeti satan ca dhammo na jaram upeti santo have sabbhi pavedayanti". 

9 Sabbhato should be corrected to sabbhuto. *^i.r ^2* have satain bhuto and satam **bhavo** before **sabbhuto** and **sabbhavo** 
respectively. **Si?** S2 have **satam karo** and **satam** 
kato before sakkaro and **sakkato** respectively, Sakarassara should be corrected to sakarass'eva.

Rule 27: S j^ , S2 j B^ add **caram** after maham. 

Rule 31: sakhato should be corrected to sakhato i.e. 

the lengthening should be shortened in the entire discussion. *^It* ^2 add **casaddaggahanam yo-ggahanam**' 
anukaddhanattam (the force of the word ca is to supply yo from the preceding rule) in the vutti.

bhatarehi respectively and **katta** after **bhata. Niyamam** should be corrected to aniyamam (uncertainty) as shown iO in T , ^1 » ^2 " It may be noted here that this expression should be translated as uncertainty, because the word **aratta** is to indicate uncertainty of the changing of the word **ara** in some case—endings e.g. 

satthussa, pitussa etc. That is, the changing of the word **ara** does not take place in the examples as stated above. T adds **kattussa** after bhatussa. 

Rule 41: ^i_ t **T, S** read **satthanam** for **satthunam.** The reading **satthanam** is closer to the original. However, acording to some modern Pali grammarians' works, the two forms [either satthanani or **satthunml** of dat. gen. pl12 - - -
are found. T adds **kattaranam** after **bhataranam** and kattunam after bhatunam. 

Rule 42: S j^ , *S^r ^i.* read **pitaranam** for pitunam, mataranam for **matunam, dhitaranam** for **dhitunam** and add bhataranam after **mataranam. ^1» ^1» ^2** add casaddaggahanain annesampi sangahanat t ham (the word **ca**

pariggaho va; kattu, kattussa, kattuno diyate pariggaho va in the vutti. *^±T* **S2 » B^^** add **casaddaggahanam** 
dutiyattha—sampindanattham (the word ca is for including the additional meaning of **salopo). Bj^** reads - **dutiya —** for - dutiyattha—-
Rule 44: T, B^ reads **saka-** for sakka-. *^1-* **Sj^** , ^2 9 ^» 
S read **apajjate** for hoti. T, B^, Sj **, S2** read **datu** for dhatu. However, **Rupasiddhi** retains both forms **(datu,** 
dhatu), and declines them as **kattu. " Sj^ , S2 j B^** add punararambaggahanam klm attham'? Nice ad i pana 11 ham . 

Sakkamandhatu. Casaddaggahanam dutiyattha—1opasampindanattham (why this sutta is specially laid down?: For, it indicates the **nicca** operation; that is, the forms sakkamandhatuno and **sakkamandhatussa** *Bre* not found; the form **sakkamandhatu** only is found. The word ca is for including the additional meaning of the elision of **sa** 
from the preceding rule) , B^ reads **dutiya —** for dutiyattha-lopa-. 

Rule 45: T adds **dhitaro** after **bhataro.** When **Senart** was deciphering the manuscripts, the words **Jana** and **janitaro** 
were possibly joined togehter; perhaps he could not distinguish it, therefore, he has read two words into single one. The reading **janitaro** should be corrected to **jana; gavo** as supported by the following versi ons. 

- 14 -
Bj[^ , T add **gavo** after **Jana,** bat **Sj^** , S2 add najjo, gavo after **ubho purisa.** "caturo jana": occurs in Ap 207, 6-7 as follows:-
"sattaviBe ito kappe ahesum caturo jana samantavaruna nama cakkavatti mahabbala". 

Rule 46s dhitari should be corrected to **dhitari** i.e. i of **dhi** - should be always lengthened in the entire discussion- S2 adds **bhattari** after vattari. 

Rule 47: Bj^ , ^1 5 ^2 read **kattara, vattara** for kattara, vattara. According to some modern Pali grammarians' 1 5 works, the words **kattu, vattu** *are* declined as **satthu** 
which has three forms i.e. **satthara, satthara, satthuna** 
in the instr. But according to **Saddaniti** only the form satthara in the instr. is found. 

Rule 48: Sj^ , S2, Bj^ add **vattari, kattari** after dhitari . Rule 49s "matito" and "pitito": occur in D I 113, 25-27 as follows:- "bhavam hi sonadando ubhato ujato matito ca pitito ca saipsuddhagahani ko yava sattama pitimohayuga akkhitto anupakkuttho jativadena". 

Rule 50: **tayinam** should be corrected to - **tayinam. Tvam** 
should be corrected to **tavam** as shown in all the versions, because it proves the exception to this rule. 

Therefore, the reading **tavam** is correct.

## Ci] Attanto Hibiniin Anattam. 211

Tassa attano anto anattam apajjate hismim vibhattimhi. Attanehi; attanebhi. Attanto ti kim attham? Gajjehi; gajjebhi. Hismin ti kim attham? 

Attana. Anattam iti bhavaniddesena attaBadda^sa sakaradesD hoti sabbasu vibhattisu. Sako; Baka; sake. 

(1) The final vowel of the word **atta**, followed by the case—ending hi, is changed into **ana.** 
When the case-ending hi follows, the final vowel of the word **atta** becomes **ana.** Thus: 'attanehi' 'attanebhi'.

The end of the fourth section in the chapter on the nama. 

C38] Akaro va. **248** 

# Notes Ii.4

This fourth section of nama (noun) covers 38 rules. 

In the rules 211—214 he deals with an irregular noun regarding the declensions of different forms. In the rules :15, 216, Ih. 245 he has laid down the technical terms Qha? P^, **jha,** la again to indicate different forms of the declensions. In the rules 217219 he deals with the neuter gender. Number 220 is a particular rule. In the rule 221 the grammarian deals with the prefixes and indec1inab1es. In the rule 222 he deals with an irregular noun used in the compound. In the rules 227—236 he deals with the pronouns in the context of adding the suffixes to them. In the rules 237-239 Kaccayana has laid down the suffixes a and i which stand for feminine gender, as also in the 240 the suffix **ini.** In the rule 241 he deals with possessive adjectives in the feminine forms. In the rules 242—244 he deals with the word **bhavanta,** as also in 245 the word bhaddanta. In the rules 243, 246-248 he has referred to the technical term ga again in the context of nominal declensions. 

There *are* 38 rules in this kanda. The rules 211 up to 214 deal with the noun **atta.** The rules 215 and 216 have wider scope. In the rule 215 the word ca stands for na in the preceding rule. In the rule 216 the word va cancels ca in the preceding rule- In the rule 218 the word niccam cancels va which must be understood in the preceding rule. In the rule 220 the word **sesato** 
cancels **napumsakehi** occuring in the rule 217. According to **Rupasiddhi** the word **api** stands for **dutiy'attha—** 
sampindanam . 

In the rule 221 the word ca stands for **lopam** in the preceding rule. In this rule upasagga and nipata also sre treated. In the rule 223 a particular noun is treated as a part of compound. In the rule 227 the word ca occurs which is considered in the vutti so as to include some other suffixes. Under the rule 228 the word ca is similarly treated in the vutti; however, in the rule 228 the word ca may stand for kissa occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 229 the word ca is taken for the word ka occuring in the rule 227; however, in the rule 230 the word ca is taken to represent u from the rule 228. This arrangement of the rule is not keeping with the usual arrangement of the rules composed by Kaccayana. In the rule 232 the word niccam cancels va in the preceding rule. In the rule 223 the word va cancels the word niccam occuring in the preceding rule. If the word va in the rule 233 is replaced by the word ca as shown in Bj^, T, the forms ato and attho would be ungrammatica 1 . Further in the rule 234 also the word ca is used; this ca can cancel the previous word va or it may stand for va. According to the vutti this ca is for **avadharana,** it means the word va is cancelled. Similarly in the rule 235 the word ca is taken for **avadharana.** However, according to the general scheme of Kaccayana the word ca may stand for **kimassa** occuring in the preceding rule- From the rule 231 the word **sabbasea** is understood up to 236. The rule 237 is a general rule for feminine nominal forms. 

Similar is the ne>:t rule also which refers to a particular group of feminine words. In the rule 24O a particular group of words is treated. In the rule 243 the word tu is significant, according to the vutti, the word tu indicates other cases also; however the rule 243 seems to be an exception to the wider rule (242). 

Moreover, the word tu also indicates the gender other than feminine which is understood in the rule 242. In the rule 245 according to the vutti the word **kvaci** is understood- The word ge is understood onwards. In the rule 246 Kaccayana uses the word va in the sense of optional operation. 

Rule li S j^ , ^2» ^1 '"^scJ rajehi **, rajebhi** for gajjehi ,

rajebhi should be accepted here. B^ reads **attano""** for attana **. T, Sj^ , ^2»** B^ add **sakain** after **saka** .

Rule 8: *^i.f ^2.* add **sabbani** before yani **. T, Bj^**

S2 add casaddaggahanam ' a v a d h a r a n **a t thain** (the word ca is added for denoting the restriction of the rule to certain instances) , but B^ adds it after yojetabban i in which SJ^,S2 J T , S read **yojetabb** a for **yojettabbam** . However yojetabba or **yojetabbani** is better reading according to the context of the vutti . Si » ^2» **Bj^** add evam before **khalu,** but T reads **eva** for **evam.** All of the version s read vo for ve **. Sj^** , S2» B^ add **alam** after aham.

"padaso dhammam vaceyya"! occurs in **Vin** IV 14, 30 - 31 as follows:— "yo pana bhikkhu anupasampannam padaso dhammam vaceyya, pacittiyam". 

Rule 15: B^ , **Sj^** read **syambhuno** for **syambhuvo.** Both *sure* correct and can be accepted, because they prove the exception of this rule. It may be noted here that according to II. 1.6S yo case-ending used after the word la (u, u) can be **changed** into either vo or no i.e. 

syambhu + yo > symbhuvo or **syambhuno.** Also **Nyasapatha** 
5 - 6 supports it. However, **Saddaniti** gives only **syambhuvo.** 
Rule 17s Sj^ , S2» T, B|^ add **ko ninditum aharati** which occurs in **Dhp** 230 as follows:-
"nekkham jambonadassa ko tarn nanditum arahati deva pi nam pasamsanti brahmuna pi pasamsito". 

Rule 20: —**tho—** in the vutti should be corrected to —to—.

6. See the declension of syambhu in **Sadd** 191, 8-14. 

7. **Nyp** also records ko. 

Rule 23: B^, T read ca for va in the vutti to cancel **va** 
from the previous rule. **Suttaniddesapatha** interprets g ca as **avadharana** which supports *B^,* T. According to Nyasapatha, this rule is unnecessary and may not be the original one composed by Kaccayana, because the example i.e. **etto, ettha** can be applied to or accomplished by 9 - 
the rule II. 1.32. But **Rupasiddhi** remarks that it is the original, because the examples i.e. **etto, ettha** can be applied to or accomplished by this rule only. lO not fay the rule II. 1.32 as stated in **Nyp.** However, Kaccayana—vannana records both the views-
Rule 24: ttham should be corrected to **thain** as shown in all the versions. 

Rule 27: Sj^, S2 add **ta, T,** B^ add **katara** in the vutti. 

Rule 28: karuni should be corrected to **taruni** as shown in all the versions. The reading **hatthi** given by Senart, S^, S^ and T has musculine gender. It may be a. See **Sdp** 80, 11, 9. "etto ty adini udaharanam. Tani hetthavuttan'eva. 

Hetthavuttanayena sijjhanato niratthakam'evidam. Na *mm m* c'eso purimapatho" **Nyp** 183, 26-28.

noted here that B. **Clough** declines hatthi as **nadi** and remarks "hatthi, when it signifies, a female 12 - 
elephant", but **PED** gives the form **hatthini** to signify a she—e1ephant. " However, the form **hatthi** is not keeping with the rule here and should be cancelled. So B j[ omi ts it. 

Rule 29: —ntuhi should be corrected to **ntuhi. Venateyyi** 
should be corrected to **venateyyi. PED** also reads - **14 venateyya** which is derived from **vinata. ^1** » ^2 » ''"»

Rule 32: "ayye": occurs in **Vin** IV 216, 14-15 as quoted under II. 1.6. "kharadiye": occurs in Ja I 160, 3-4 as quoted under II. 1.6, Rule 33: bhonte should be corrected to **bhante** as shown in all the versions. **Bhadde** should be added after bhonto in the vutti as shown in all the versions and also in the citations. 

Rule 36: **Bj^** adds **bho raja** in the vutti.

The end of the fifth section in the chapter on the nama . 

# Notes I I.5

This fifth section of nama (noun) covers 24 rules. 

In the rules 249-262 the grammarian deals with the pronouns by adding the various Cease-] suffi>ses to them in order to indicate different meanings according to the context. In the rules 263-271 he deals with the suffixes of taddhita to indicate an abstract noun and the degree of comparision. In the rule 272, he deals with the suffix **sma** in the context of particular words. 

In the calophon of **Rupasiddhi's** Nama—kanda, Buddhappiya classifies the formation of the noun as fivefold: (1) **pullinga** (masculine) (2) **itthilinga** 
(feminine) (3) **napumsaka 1 iiiga** (neuter) **(4) tilinga** 
(having three genders) (5) **alinga** (non-gender). In this context he re—arranges Kaccayana's rules according to the classification of the usages so that a student 2 -
can understand it viith ease. But Kaccayana does not follow such method; he mixes the declensions of the nouns, pronouns, irregular nouns etc. of different genders. 

In this kanda, there *are* 24 rules. At the beginn1. "pullingam itthilingan ca napumsakam athaparam tilingan ca alingan ca namikam pancadha thitam" Rup 128, 13-19. 

ing the technical term **vibhatti** is applied to to etc. 

In the rules where the word ca as shown in S and Sj^ , 
it is taken to indicate **kvaci** occuring in the rule 250; however, this reading ca for **kvaci** does not suit the Kaccayana's general arrangement of the rules; therefore other versions omit it. The word **sattamiya** is understood up to 257. In the rule 255 the word ca stands for **him** and **ham** from the precedinq rule, m m » _ -
according to the vutti; however, the word ca indicates generally a particular grammatical operation and not exclusion as in the vutti. In this case the vutti says that the word ca indicates the exclusion of **hincana.** 
In the rule 256 the word ca is taken in the sense of **avadharana.** From the rule 258 the word **kale** is governing. In the rule 260 the word ca, according to the vutti, stands for da from the previous rule. 

Similarly, in the rule 261 the word ca indicates **da.** 
However, this ca is explained differently in the different manuscripts. Therefore the word ca in the rule 261 may be taken in the sense of **sattamiya** (251) or kale (258). In this case, we may note that all the versions read the rule 261 as imasma rahi—**dhuna—dani** ca. 

In this rule, the word ca is not necessary, because the viord **dani** occurs in the rule. Therefore the original rule should be **imasma rahi - dhuna ca** as supported by Rupasiddhi-tika.^ In the rule 263 the word ca cancels the word vā in the preceding rule.  In the rule 265 the cc word word iy'itthesu continues up to 270. In the The rule 269 the word ca stands for  kanam.  In the rule 272 particular  words  are enlisted as  exception  for  sma.

Generally  such  type  of list occurs at the  end  of  a kanda.

Rule 1:  S1, S2, T, B1 add kad¯4 after tad¯.

Rule 2: B1, S2 add imasm¯ in the vutti.

5: S°, S2 add ca which stands for kvaci  from  the Rule preceding  rule after vo in the rule.  S2, T  add  kvaci
(sometimes) in the vutti and T puts kasmiṃ gato'si after devanampiyatissa,  but  S2  adds kvaci  ti  kim  atthaṃ?

Kasmim  gato'si   (why sometimes?:  For,  the  following example  is found: `kasmim gato´si´)— which seems to  be necessary  to  make the vutti completed.  T and  S2  add kvaci in the vutti to indicate that the form kasmiṃ can used  or substituted i.e. it is used  in  the s be sense of kva (the locative case).

Rule 8: dhā in the vutti should be corrected to dha as shown in all the versions.

Rule 13: S1  reads  dānipaccayaṃ'anukaḍḍhanatthaṃ for ddpaccay' anukaddhanattham, S2  and B1 read the same but omit either dani- or da-.  T omits this sentence.  If we read dāni- as suggested by Si, it would be repeated  and cccl
---
Even **Suttaniddeeapatha** supports S^ but still records dani in the rule."

"samannam" : occur s i n S V 25 , 3—4 a s follows: - 
"samannan ca vo bhikkhave desissami samannaphalani ca tam sunatha". 

Rule 17: B^ , *^i.f* ^2» ^ read **pasatthassa** for **passatthassa,** whatever reading we may accept, even **PED** gives two forms. "seyyo": occurs in **Dhp** 106 as quoted under II. 1. 32. "settho": occurs in **Vin III** 4, 2-3 as quoted under II. 1. 32. "jettho": occurs in D II 15, 10-12 as quoted under II. 1. 32. 

Rule 19: T, S^ read **sado** for **sadho.** 
5. "tipadam'idam. Imasma ti avadhi. Rahi- dhuna - dani ti visayi. Ca ti anukaddhana. Sanna pe— vidhisuttan ti datthabbam. Anuvattamanadapaceayam nivattetum idha anuvattamane siddhe pi danipaccayo gahito. Caggahanam kale sattamay'atthe saddanam anukaddhanattham" **Sdp 84,** 8-12. 

6. **PED,** s.v. pasattha. 

Rule 20: B^ reads **kan** for kanain. 

Rule 22: S2» Cd add **ganiyo, ganittho** after gunittho. 

S2 add casaddaggahanam iya - ittha—ggahanam'anukaddhanattham (the word ca is to supply the suffixes iya and **ittha** from previous rule) S^ reads the same but omits iya - **ittha—ggahanam.** 
Rule 23: Si » ^2 **^^id karunnaip, B^** adds **karunnain, kosallain** 
in the vutti, - **desam sannapana 11 hain** should be joined as 
- **desasannapana t thain** which seems to be better sentence, 
"bahusaccam": occurs in **Khp** V 4 as quoted under II.

(2) And in connection with the roots, nouns and prepositions etc. also.

The  case-relation is called apādāna also  in cc In connection with the use of  roots  as  follows:-  The root  ji being used with the prefix parā, the  
subduer is called **apadana.** For example 'buddhasma parajenti annatitthiya'. The root **bhu** being used with the prefix pa 5 that from which something continues becomes apadana. For example 'himavanta pabhavanti panca mahanadiyo' 'anavatattamha pabhavanti mahasara''aciravatiya pabhavanti kunadiyo'. The case-relation is called apadana in connection with the nouns. For example 'urasma jato putto' *bhumito niggato raso' 'ubhato sujato putto'. The case-relation is termed **apadana** also in connection with prepositions, etc. For example 'apa salaya ayanti vanija' 'a brahmaloka saddo abbh'uggacchati' 'upari pabbata devo vassati'. 

'buddhasma pati sariputto dhammadesanaya alapati' 'ternasam ghatam assa telasma pati dadati' 'uppalam assa padumasma pati dadati' 'kanakam assa hirannasma pati dadati'. By the force of **adi** the ablative case is used even in the case of other case-relations. For example 
'pakkhasma vijjhati migain' 'kosa vijjhati kunjaraip' 
'Vr 

'masasma bhunjati bhojanam'. By the force of **api** even in connection with the indec1inab1es, the ablative case is used as well as accusative and instrumental. For example 'rahita matuja punnam katva phalam deti, rahita matujam, rahita matujena va''rite saddhamma kuto sukham labhati, rite saddhammam, rite saddhammena va ' 
•te bhikkhu nana kula pabbajita, nana kulam, nana 'Vi- '\j -

kulena va' 'vina saddhamma natth'anno koci natho loke buddhasma , vina buddham , vina buddhena va' . By the force of ca the ablative case is used also elsewhere . 

For e>:ample 'yato'ham bhagini ariyaya jatiya jato ' 
'yato sarami attanam, yato patto'sm i vinnutam ' 'yatvadhikarana m enam abhijjhadomanass a papaka akusala dhamm a anvassaveyyum' .

(3) The desired object in connectio n with the root s meaning protection. 

In connection with the roots denoting protectio n the object desired becomes **apadana karaka.** For exampl e 
'kake rakkhanti tandula' 'yava patisedhenti gavo' .

The sixth case—ending is sometimes used in denoting the sense of the third and seventh cases. For example 'katam me ka1yanam''katarn me papam'; here sixth case-ending is used in the sense of the third caseending. 'Kusala naccagitassa susikkhita caturitthiyo' 
'kusalo tvam rathassa angapaccanganam'; here sixth case-ending is used in the sense of the seventh caseending.  Why sometimes?: For, to the following example, this is not applicable: `desito  ānanda  mayā  dhammo'
`ānando atthesu vicakkhaṇo´. [39] Dutiyā-pancaminan ca.

(40) The seventh case-ending is used in the sense of kamma, karana as **well** as in denoting a motive. 

The seventh case-ending is used in denoting the sense of the object, instrument as well as in signifying a motive. For example 'sundar'avuso ime ajivika bhikkhusu abhivadenti'; here seventh case—ending is used in the sense of the accusative case; 'hatthesu pindaya caranti' 'pattesu pindaya caranti' 'pathesu caranti' ; here seventh case-ending is used in the sense of the instrumental case; 'dipi cammesu hannate'

## Notes Iii

This chapter of karaka covers 45 rules. **Aggavantsa** 
gives the meaning of karaka as follows: "A karaka is the cause of action. That which something is the cause of the accomplishment of the action by force of its being primary or secondary one due to the real nature of accomplishment, that is called karaka. It does the action by force of being primary or secondary one, this is called karaka". **Buddhappiya** explains it as: "That which does; changes or attains the meaning with the action, is called karaka; (this is) the cause of the actions beginning with coming forth"."^ B. **Clough** 
explains it as: "The karaka, is so called, from its being used in pointing out the means by which an act is performed".'^ C. **Duroiselle** explains it as follows:— "The term 'karaka' expresses the relation between the noun 1. "kiriyanimittam karakam. Yam sadhanasabhavattamukhyavasena va upacaravasena va kiriyabhinipphattiya nimittam, tarn vatthu karakam nama bhavati; mukhyopacaravasena hi kiriyam karoti ti karakam" Sadd 691, 1-4, cf.ES p.28. 2. "yam va attham karoti nibbatteti; vikaroti vikaram apadiyati; yam va kriyaya papunati, tarn karakam nibbattanadikriyanimittam" **Rup-t** 92 , 22-24. 

3. **CPG** p. 123. 

and the verb; BD that any relation existing between word5 not connected with a verb cannot be called a 
- 4 -
karBikBi". According to **Su ttan iddesapa t ha** the meaning is twofold:- (1) **karaka** (2) **akaraka."** The Pali grammarians do not consider the Genitive as karaka, for it has no relation with the verb; it is generally concerned with the relationship between substantives. 

They also do not consider the Vocative as a separate case for the same reason. Therefore, they are called BkarAkEi ( non-karaka ) . **Buddhappiya** and **AggavainBa** have divided the karaka into six kinds:— (i) **kattu (2) kamma** 
4. **PGP** p. 300.

(3) karana (4) sampadana (5) apadana (6) **okasa.** 
However, Kaccayana gives the order of the karaka—s as foilOW5:— 
(1) apadana (2) sampadana (3) okasa (4) karana (5) kamma 
(6) kattu, plus the **hetu** or causal agent as a subdivision of kattu. He has taken the apadana as the first because it is the most extensive. F. **Mason**

Mahavisayatta remarkss "The first case taken up by Kachchayan o is the ablative , becasuse , say s the commentator , it is the most extensive ; but it is not pursued at once to a 9 conclusion" . In the chapter on the declensions , the karaka- 5 have been shown by their vibhatti- s of whic h the Nominativ e or Vocativ e ending , in many instances , 
a re alike and the differen t case - e n d i n g s mark the differen t cases . However , in this chapter the case s are designate d by appropriat e name s and they *a^re* referred to numericall y according to the number of the case-ending s connected with it as stated below:— 
(1) **kattu** - pathamavibhatti (Nominative case ) whic h occur s in the rules 283 , 284 , 286 . 

(2) **kamma** - dutiyavibhatt i (Accusative case ) whic h occur s in the rules 282 , 299-302 , 308 , 309 . 

(3) **karana** - tatiyavibhatti (Instrumental case ) whic h occur s in the rules 281 , 288-294 , 317 . 

(4) sampadana - catutthivibhatt i (Dative case ) whic h occur s in the rules 278 , 279 , 295 , 296 . 

( 5 ) **apadan** a - paneamivibhatt i (Ablativ e case ) whic h occur s in th e rule s 273-277 , 297 , 298 . 

(fc) **sam** i - chatthivibhatt i (Genitiv e case ) whic h occur s in th e rule s 295 , 303 , 3 0 5 - 7 , 310 , 311 . 

( 7 ) **okas** a - sattamivibhatt i (Locativ e case ) whic h occur s in the rules 2SO, S04-7, 312-7. 

(S> **alapana** - Vocative case which occurs in the rule 287 . 

First of all, Kaccayana gives definition of each karaka and then the usages of each vibhatti-s according to their functions. He treats the karaka—s as a part of vibhatti-5, therefore he combines the karaka—s and vibhatti-s together in this chapter. However, not all vibhatti-s are karaka—s; but all karaka-s *sre* vibhatti-s . 

There *are* 45 rules in the sixth kanda. First definition of **apadana** is provided and the word apadanam is indicated by the word ca in the next rule. The word **api** extends the technical term **apadana** in the context of a particular word. In the rule 276 the word va makes the **apadana** optional for **adhikarana,** it means that in the rule 275 **apadana** is obligatory. In the rule 277 the word ca cancels the word va in the preceding rule. In the rule 278 the word va indicates atthavikappana. However, according to the construction of this rule Kaccayana wants to indicate different meaning in which **sampadana** can be applied. 

In the rule 279 the word ca stands for **sampadana** 
occuring in the rule 278. In the rule 281 the word va stands for **passati; sunati** according to the vutti. 

Similarly, in the rule 284 the word va is understood. 

In the rule 285 the word va occurs, it means it is not understood in the rules 283 and 284. In the rule 287 the word ca stands for **pathama** occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 289 the word ca stands for tatiya occuring in the preceding rule. Similarly, in the rules 290, 291 and 292 also, the word ca occurs for pathama. But in **S^^, Cd** liss the word ca is not found in the vutti under the rule 289. Again in the rule 293 the word ca is not found, but it is found in the rule 294. According to **Kaccayana—vannana** the word ca stands for samuccayattha. In the rule 296 the word ca stands for catutthi which occurs in the preceding rule. In the rule 296 the word api occurs which is significant. In the rule 298 the word ca stands for **pancami** occuring in the preceding rule. In the rule 300 the word **dutiya** is understood, but Kaccayana does not use the word ca or api as he has used in the rule 296. 

Therefore, it is significant that in the rule 301 S2 reads the word **ca.** In the rule 305 the word **ca** 
1 0. "caggahanassa samuccayatthatta dabba- gotta—nama -
jati - sippa - vaya - gunabhavena visesanam va pakati yebhuyyena donadikam va sabbam ganhati" **Kvn** 212, 1719, see also "ca ti anukaddhana; samuccayaniddeso va" Sdp 130, 7. 

stands for **sattami** occuring in the preceding rule. 

Similarly, in the rules 306 and 307 the word ca is used. 

However, S^ does not read the word ca in the vutti under the rule 306 and Bi » T, Sj^ , **Senart** under the rule 307. In the rule 309 the word ca stands for **dutiya** 
occuring in the preceding rule. However, in the rule 3iO the word ca stands for **tatiya—sattaminam** occuring in the rule 309. In **Senart, T, Sj^** Mss the word ca is not found in the vutti under the rule 310, similarly, under the rule 311 also. In the rule 313 the word ca stands for **sattami** in the preceding rule. Similarly, in the following two rules also the word ca stands for sattami occuring in the rule 312. However, in the rule 316 the word ca is not used by Kaccayana. Again in the last rule in this kanda the word ca is used for **sattami** 
occuring in the rule 312. 

Rule 2: himavanta should be corrected to **himavata** as shown in all the versions. T, K add **satta** before maha5ara. Kunadiyo should be corrected to **kunnadiyo.** *B^* 
S^ add **matito ca pitito ca** after sujato putto. *Bj^* reads 12 -
pari for upari . ^ i. f *^Ir ^2* f "^ add **bhikkhu** after dhammadesanaya. The semi-colon after **alapati** should be shifted to **temasam. Ghatam** (bowl) should be corrected to **ghatam** (ghee) which is keeping with the contex t of the sentence . Bj^ , S2 add **ito** befor e pakkhasma **. Bj^ , Sj^ , S2** add **luddako** after **migam. S** 2 add s ito before kosa. *B^,* S^ read **danam** for **phalain.** S2 reads bhavati for labhati. Bj^ , *^Ir* ^2» ^^ omit nana kulain, nana kulena va after pabbajita **. T,** K add **n'abhiJanam** i sancicca panam jivita voropet a after jatiya jato . Bi5 K, T add **cak k hundr iy am asamvutant viharanta** m after **yatv** - 
adhikaranam enam. Anvassaveyyu m should be correcte d to **anvassaveyyum.** "himavata pabhavanti panca maha -
nadiyo" : occurs in P B **III** 37 , 12-13 as followsi - "evam etam panca mahanadiyo himavantat o pabhavanti" . "ubhato sujato putto matito ca pitito ca" : occur s in D I 113 , 
25—2 6 as quoted under 1.3.49. "a brahmaloka sadd o abbh'uggacchati" : occur s in **Vin III** 1*?, 4 - 5 as follows: - "iti' ha tena khanena tena muhutten a yava brahmaloka saddo abbh'ugganchi" . It may be noted here that B^ quotes Vin **III** 19 where we have the word **yava** 
in the place of a. According to the vutti we need upasagg a (a) as the exampl e of governing apadana , but B^ quote s nipata **(yava)** which is not keeping with the vutti expected here. However , **Rupasiddh** i and **Saddaniti** 
have two examples i.e. **a brahmaloka saddo** 
abbh'uggacchati which has been taken over from Kacc—v and yava **brahmaloka saddo abbh'uggacchat** i 
(abbh'ugganchi} composed by them which is not availabl e in **Kacc—**V to indicate the examples of upasagga (a) and nipata **(yava).** Therefore, Bj^ ' s quotation is keeping with **yava** composed by **Rup** and **Sadd**. "te bhikkhu nana kula pabbajita": occurs in **Vin III** 8, 9-12 as follows:— 
"tesam buddhanam bhagavantanam antaradhanena buddhanubuddhanam savakanam antaradhanena ye te pacchima savaka nananama nanagotta nanajacca nanakula pabbajita". It may be noted here that according to the quotation given by Bj^ the word **nana** used in the sense of an adjective here means "various, of all kinds". ^ 
Therefore **nanakula** here would be rendered as; "various families;all kinds of family" which is not keeping with the vutti expected by the grammarian, because he wants to indicate the word **nana** used in the sense of an adverb which means "without; except; different from" to 14 _ _ _ 
which the word **vina** is equal. Therefore **nana kula** 
would be rendered as 'without; except; different from 13. **PED** s.v. **nana.** 14. "te bhikkhu nana kula ti ettha vivajjanatthavacakena nana ti nipatena yogatta te bhikkhu kulam vajjetva pabbajita ty attho" **Kvn** 196, 3-4, "kula ti nananipatayogasaddatth'apadanam. Nana ti nana hutva ti attho. Kula ti va kammappavacaniyayogadutiyapasanke nipatayogasadd'apadanam. Kulam nana vajjetva ti attho" Sdp 96, 25-28, see also, ES pp. 143-144. 

the family which the grammarian expects here, 
"yato'ham bhagini ariyaya jatiya jato": occurs in M II 
103, 19—20 as follows:- "yato aham bhagini ariyaya 
-fv jatiya jato n'abhijanami sancicca panam jivita voropeta; tena saccena sotthi te hotu sotthi gabbhassa"- "yato sarami attanam" and "yato patto'smi vinnutam": occur in Ja VI 79, 3—4 as follows:— 
"yato sarami attanam yato patto'smi vinnutam A* 'V 
na mam miga uttasanti aranne sapadanipi". 

"yatvadhikaranam enam cakkhundriyam asamvutam viharantam abhijjhadomanassa papaka akusala dhamma anvassaveyyum": occurs in D I 70, S—12 as follows:— "idha maharaja bhikkhu cakkhuna rupam disva na nimittaggahi __ 'V 
hoti nanuvyanjanaggahi. Yatvadhikaranam enam cakkhundriyam asamvutam viharantam abhijjhadosamanassa papaka akusala dhamma anvassaveyyurn" . 

Rule 4: B^ reads **jetavane antaradhayati bhagava, T:** 
jetavane antarahito; veluvane antarahito, S^: jetavane antaradhayati; veluvane antaradhayati bhagava, ^2 * 
jetavane antarahito; veluvane antarahito bhagava, however, **Nyasapatha** and **Rupasiddhi** record only **jetavane** 
antarahito. Rule 5: - ppamana— of the following vutti also should be corrected to - **ppamana—, - panha—** of the following T, K add **agato** after **gamena va. Vinayam** should be corrected to dhammavinayam. **T, K** read antika gama; asanna gama; samipa gama; samipa saddhamma for antikam gama; asannam gama; 5amipam gama; samipam saddhamma. 

T, K read **antikam gamam antikena gamena va; asannam ga—**

T adds **vo** 
S^ , ^21 **kho** before **ito.** T, Sj^ , *^2 r* ^1 read **bhagava** for sammasambuddho. T, *^±f* **^2» ^1»** ^ read **udapadi** for upajji. "ito bhikkhave ekanavutikappe vipassi nama bhagava loke udapadi": occurs in D II 2, 15-16 as followsi— "ito so bhikkhave ekanavuto kappo yam vipassi bhagava araham sammasambuddho loke udapadi". It may be noted here that we find the variant reading ekanavutikappe in **D II** 2 also. B^ reads **parinibba—** 
yissati for **parinibbayissami** which is closer to the citation- "ito tinnam masanam accayena par inibbayissati": occurs in D II 106, IS —20 as follows:— "appossukko tvam papima hoti, na ciram tathagatassa parinibbanam bhavissati, ito tinnam masanam accayena tathagato parinibbayissati". Hatthikkhanda or **- kkhandam** should be corrected to **hatthikkhandh** a or 
- kkhandham. "pasada sankameyya " and "hatthikkhandh a Bankameyya" : occur in S I 95 , 28—3 2 as followsi - 
"seyyathapi maharaja puriso pallanka va pallankanri sankameyya , assapitthiya va assapitthi m sankameyya , hatthikkhandh a va hatthikkhandha m sankameyya , pasada va pasadam sankameyya , tath'upam'aha m maharaja imam puggalam vadami" . S2 J B ^ add **yava** after **avicito** . Sj^,

"sunantu me janapada negama *c:ei* samagata yat'odakam tadadittam yato khemam tato bhayam" . 

T adds tacapariyantam purannanappakarass **a asucin** o paccavekkhati after **kesamatthaka** . "uddham padatala ; atho kesamatthaka " : occurs in D II 293 , 
10-12 as follows: - "puna ca param bhikkhav e bhikkh u imam eva kayam uddham padatala adho kesamatthak a tacapariyantam puram nanappakarass a asucino paccavekk -
hati" . B^ reads **sugatavinay** o for **sugatavinayam** . 

1 5. Sadd also reads bhagavantam . 

1 6. Rup and **Sadd** read **sugatavinayo** . 

1 7 . **Nyp** also *resids-* suga tavinayam. 

"gamadhamma vasa1 adhamma asaddhamma arati virati pativirati": occurs in **Nidd De** 45, 1-3 as follows;— 
" br ahmac ar iy am vuccati asaddhammasamapat. t iy a arati virati pativirati veramani akiriya akaranam anajjhapatti velaanatikkamo". In this context, it may be noted here that **gamadhamma, vasaladhamma** and **asaddhamma** 
are not found in the quotation expected by the vutti, but we find **asaddhammasamapattiya** only. However, it can be used in the sense of apadana with the word **ara** 
expected by the vutti. "panatipata veramani": occurs in Vin I 83, 31—33 as follows:— "anujanami bhikkhave samaneranam dasa sikkhapadani, tesu ca samanerehi sikkbiturn: panatipata veramani adinnadana...". **Si?** ^2 ' 
18 - 
T, BlJ add **asamsattho** after **suddho.** "lobhaniyehi dhammehi suddho asamsattho": occurs in M II 172, 2—4 as follows:- "atthi nu kho imassa ayasmato tatharupa lobhaniya dhamma yatharupehi lobhaniyehi dhammehi pariyadinnacitto ajanam va vadeyya janami". In this context , we may remark that B^ quotes M II 172 as an example which is not keeping with the context expected by the vutti, because the vutti wants to explain the word **suddha** 'pure' used with apadana. But we find pariyadinnacitto (having exhausted mind) instead. 

Therefor e the quotation given by B^ is wrongly quoted here."matit D ca pitito ca suddh o asaipsattho anupakutth o agarahito" : occurs in D I 113 , 25-2 7 as quoted unde r 1.3.49. S^, S2 , B^, T read **na te** 
19 for tato par i as follows: - "yo ca kho bhikkhav e rupam n'abhinandat i dukkham so n'abhinandati parimutt o so dukkhasm a ti vadami" . K reads **hetu** for hetuna **. Bj^ , S2** add **kena**

"alam me tena rajjena natakehi dhanen a va y am me adhammacariyaya rajjam labhetha sarathi" . 

In this context , we may remark that according to the quotation , **alam** is used in the sense of **patikkhep** a 
'rejection of; enough' , but here it is used in the 44 sense of **araha** 'capable of ; worthy of ; fit for' . 

Therefore , Bj^ q u o t es **Vin III** and Ja VI which are not keeping with the context expected by the vutti. All the versions read **hi rannasuvannena** '"" for **hirannasuva** -

according to the vutti, the word **bhiyya** governs the dative case as stated by B. **Clough:** "bhiyo, much, governs a noun in the fourth case; as, bhiyoso mattaya, in great measure". However, we find the readings bhiyyoso mattaya; bhiyyo so mattaya; bhiyyo somattaya, but **somattaya** should be split as **so mattaya.** 
Saddaniti takes **bhiyyoso** as synonymous with the word bhiyyo." But **Kaccayana—vannana** splits it into two words **bhiyyo** and so and takes **bhiyyo** as an adjective 52 synonymous with the word **atirekataro.** However, Suttaniddesapatha takes both the views,"" but **Aggavamsa** 
does not agree with the view of splitting it as 
'so puggalo mattaya madanataya bhiyyo" and 5 0. **CPG** p. 137.

Rule 32: Bj^ , Sj^ , **82?** K read **odakantike** for **odakannave** 
T: udakantike. However, the reading **odakantike** is closer to the citation, "gambhire odakantike": occurs in **Khp VIII** 1 as follows:-
"nidhim nidheti puriso gambhire odakantike atthe kicce samuppanne atthaya me bhavissati". 

"papasmim ramati mano": occurs in **Dhp** 116 as quoted under III. 25. B^, S2 read **vussati** for **vasati** which is close to the citation, "bhagavati brahmacariyam vussati kulaputto": occurs in M I 147, 15-17 as follows:-

Bi reads yo vo mayā dhammo ca vinayo ca desito pannatto    for ananda ānanda mayā dhammo, S2 adds ca vinayo ca desito pannatto  after  dhammo.  However, Bi's   reading has canonical  support  which occurs in D II  154,  5-8  as follows:- "na kho pan'etaṃ ānanda evaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ yo vo ānanda mayā dhammo ca vinayo ca desito pannatto, so  vo mam'accayena sattha".

It may be noted here that we expect the form **bhikkhus** u

the forms **bhikkhu** and **dantehi** should be corrected to bhikkhusu and **dantesu** so that the example s would be applicabl e to the rule expected .

## C13 Namanam Samaso Yuttattho. 318

Tesam namanam payujjamanapadatthanam yo yuttattho 50 samasasanno hoti. Kathinassa du55am: kathinadu55am;

Yuttattho ti kim attham? Bhato ranno; putto devadatta55a. Samara ice anena kv attho? Kvaci sama— Bagatanam akaranto (IV. 2 2 ) . 

(1) The combined sense of nouns is samasa. 

The combined sense of the aggregation of the meanings of nouns is called samasa (compound). For example 'cloth for the kathina robe (the annual robepresentation ceremony in the month following the end of the rains Retreat) = kathinadussam' 'meals for t he guest: agantukabhattam' 'life and the sense-faculties: 
jivitindriyam' 'monk and brahmin: samanabrahmana' 
'sariputta and moggallana : sariputta —mogga11 ana' 
"brahmin and householder : brahmanagahapatika'. Why denoting nouns?: For, the following words are n ot called samasa: 'devadatto pacati'. Why the combined sense of nouns?: For, in the following example, t he combined meaning is not found: "bhato ranno' 'putto devadattassa'. 

What i5 the use of the term of Bain*6a7i (It is useful) for, it will be used in the rule *Kvaci samasagatanam akaranto (IV. 2 2 ) ' . 

C23 Tesani vibhattiyo lopa ca. 319 Tesam yuttatthanam samasanam vibhattiyo lopa ca honti. Kathinadussaro; aqantukabhattam. Tesam-qahanena samasa - taddhit'akhyata - kitakappanam paccayapadakkha -

vasittho; vinataya apaccam, putto: venateyyo. 

Casaddaggahanam avadharanattham. Pabham karoti ti pabhankaro; amatain dadati ti amatandado; medham karoti ti medhankaro. 

(2) And the case—endings of those *are* dropped. 

The case-endings of those words which *B.rG* united in a compound *are* elided. For example 'kathinadussam' 
'agantukabhattam'. By the word tesaqt, (those), paccaya 
(suffixes), pada (words), akkhara (sounds) and agama 
(augments) occuring in the compounds, taddhita, akhyata and kita *Ar-e* also elided. For example 'offspring of vasittha: vasittho' 'offspring of vinata: 
venateyyo'. The word ca indicates restriction of the rule to certain examples to the exclusion of others. 

For example 'one who makes light: pabhankaro' "one who gives the deathless state: amatandado' 'one who makes wisdom: medhankaro'. 

C3] Pakati cassa sarantassa. 320 Luttasu vibhattisu assa sarantassa lingassa

pakatirupani honti. Cakkhun ca sotan ca: cakkhusotam; mukhan ca nasikan ca: mukhanaBikam; ranno putto; rajaputto; ranno puriso: rajapuriso. 

(3) The words ending in vowels assume the primitive forms. 

When the case-endings have been elided, the words ending in vowels assume their basic forms. For example 
"eye and eari cakkhusotam' 'mouth and nose: mukhanasikam' 'the king's son: rajaputto' 'the king's man: 
raj apuri so' .

Abyayibhava ice anena kv attho? Am vibhattinam akarantabyayibhava (IV. 26) . 

(4) Abyayibhava has upasagga or nipata as a first member. 

The combination of words with upasagga or nipata as a first member is called abyayibhava. For example 
'near the town (the story continues): upanagaram' 
'without axiety: niddaratham' 'without mosquitoes: 
nimmasakam' 'according to seniority : yathavuddham' 
'brahmin-s 5it according to seniority : yathavuddham''a s long as life lasts s yavajivam ' 'having concerne d wit h mind Cthe dhamma-s activate] : adhicittam' 'beyond (on the other side of) the mountai n : tiropabbatarn' '(boat moves ) against the stream : patisotam' 'within the palace : antopasadam' . What is the use of the term abyayibhava? : (It is useful ) for , it will be used in the rule 'Am vibhattinam akarantabyayibhav a (IV. 

2 6 ) ' . 

C 5] So napumsakalingo . 32 2 So abyayibhavasamas o napumsaka1ing o va datthabbo . 

Kumarim adhikicca katha vattati ti adhikumari ; vadhuy a samip e vattati ti upavadhu ; gangaya samipe vattat e iti upagangam ; manikaya samipe vattat e iti upamanikam . 

(5) It has neuter gender . 

T he indeclinable compound is to be regarded as neuter only. For exampl e 'having concerned with the young girl (the story continues) : adhikumar i 
'near the lady: upavadhu' 'near the ganga : upagangam' near the gem: upamanikam'.

(6) Singularity of **Digu** (it is laid). 

The numerical compound is singular and neuter. 

For example 'the three worlds: tilokam' 'the three sticks : tidandam' "the three eyes : tinayanam' 'the three horns : tisingam' 'the four directions s catuddisam' 'the ten directions : dasadisam' 'the five sense —facu1 ties s paneindriyam' .

(7) Even so in the dvanda compound (singularity) of words of the following meanings (it laid down) : limbs of living beings, instruments of music, objects belonging to a yoke, objects relating to an army, little creatures, objects which indicate various degrees of difference and contrary qualities etc. 

So in the dvanda (aggregative) compound 
(singularity) of words beginning with limbs of living beings, instruments of music, objects belonging to a yoke, component part of an army, little creatures, objects which *Eire* mutually disagreeing, contrary qualities, have the singular number and neuter gender. For example 'cakkhusotarn' 'mukhanasikam' 
'chavimamsa1ohitarn' these are used in the sense of limbs of living beings; 'conch and drum: sankhapanavam' 
'singing and instrumental music : gitavaditam' 'drum and kettle-drum : daddaridendimam' these are used in the sense of instruments of music; 'ploughshare and goad : phalapacanam' 'yoke and plough : yuganangalam' these are used in the sense of objects belonging to a yoke; 'sword and sheath : asicammam' 'arrow and bow :

(8) Also for the (compounds) of words meaning trees, grass, animals, valuable things, grains and inhabitants of a country etc. option is laid down. 

A Dvanda compound of words denoting trees, grass, animals, valuable things, grains and people etc. also optionally becomes the singular and neuter. For example "the holy fig - tree and wood apple - trees assatthakapittham or assatthakapittha' 'grass and fragrant grass: usiraviranam or usiravirana' 'goat and sheep: ajelakaip or ajelaka' 'money and gold: hiranna-

Mahapphalaṃ; mahabbalaṃ; mahaddhano; mahabbhayaṃ.

(15) When the word in the same case-ending follows, the forms of mahanta are changed into mahā.

The forms of the word mahanta are changed into mahā, when  a word having the same case follows. For  example
`mahāpuriso' `mahādevī' `mahābalaṃ' `mahāphalaṃ' `mahānago'  `mahayaso' `mahapadumavanam'  `mahanadi'  `maha-
`mahāgahapati'  `mahādhanaṃ'  ´mahāpunno'.   The mani plural form  of mahantaṃ indicates that  sometimes  the word  mahanta    changes   into  maha.

For   example
`mahapphalaṃ´ `mahabbalaṃ´ `mahaddhano´ `mahabbhayaṃ´.

(16) If a feminine word follows, a masculine word retains its gender, if it is used in masculine in language. 

When a femine word in the same case follows, a feminine word becomes masculine, if it is masculine in spoken language. For e>:ample ' (person) whose lower legs are long: dighajangho' *(person) whose wife is good: ka 1yanabhariyo' ' (the tathagata) whose wisdom is abundant: pahutapanno', why 'bhasita—puma'?: For, the rule is not applicable to the following: 'wife of an unworthy brahmana: brahmabandhubhariya'.

(17) Also in the kammadharaya. 

When the kammadharaya is formed, if the feminine word in the same case is combined, the preceding word having masculine gender in language retains its masculine gender. For example 'brahmanadarika' 
'V n/ 
"khattiyakanna' "khattiyakumarika'. Why 'bhasitapuma'?: For, the rule is not applicable to the following kammadharaya—s: "khattiyabandhudarika' 'brahmanabandhudarika' 'pannaratanam'.

(18) Change of na into a (is laid down) , when it precedes in tappurisa. 

When a member in a tappurisa compound follows, the sound na becomes a. For example 'abrahmano' 'avasalo' 
'abhikkhu' 'apancavasso'. 

C193 Sare an. 336 Nassa padassa tappurise uttarapade sabbass'eva anadeso hoti sare pare. Anasso; anariyo; anittho.

(20) Ku changes into kada. 

In tappurisa compound ku is changed into kada, if a vowel follows. For example 'bad food : kadannam' 
'disliked eating: kadasanam'. Why 'if a vowel follows'?: For, in the following examples, this change is not found: 'due to bad luck who have bad wives: kudara' 'kuputta' 'kugeha' 'kuvattha' 'kudasa'. 

## C213 **Kappatthesu** Ca. 338

kapuriso, kupuriso. 

(21) Also changes into ka in diminutives. 

The word ku becomes ka in diminutives. For example "kalavanam' 'kapuppham'. Why plural **appatthesu** 
is used?: For, the word ku is sometimes changed into ka even in other than diminutives. For example 'bad person: kapuriso, kupuriso'. 

C223 Kvaci samasantagatanam akaranto. 339 Samasantagatanam namanam anto kvaci akaro hoti.

(Nadianta ca kattuanta kappaccayo hoti samasante. Bahu nadiyo yassa so bahunadiko; bahuvo kattaro yassa so bahukattuko). 

(22) The final vowels of the last members in compounds sometimes change into a. 

The final vowels of the final members in compounds sometimes become a. For example 'the king of gods : 
devarajo' 'friend of gods: devasakho' 'five days: 
pancaham' 'five cows: pancagavam' 'umbrella and shoes: 
chattupahanam' 'near autumn : upasaradam' '(the person) whose eyes are large: visalakkho' '(the person) whose face is pale: vikalamukho'. Why the word kara is used?: For, the final vowel is also changed into a and i. For example '(the person) who has experienced dhamma: *psiCCBtkkhBtdhamma'* 'possessing fragrance: sugandhi' 'having bad smell : duggandhi' 
'which has foul smell: putigandhi'. CThe suffix ka is added as the final of compound after the words nadi and **kattu.** For example '(the country) having abundant rivers: bahunadiko' '(the king) having many officers: bahukattuko' 1 -
C23] **Nadiroha ca. 340** 
Nadimha ca kappaccayo hoti samasante. 

Bahavo kantiyo yassa so bahukantiko; bahavo nadiyo yassa so bahunadiko; bahavo nariyo yassa so bahunariko. 

(23) Also after **nadi.** 
In the final of a compound the suffix ka is added after the word **nadi.** For example '(the person) whose pleasures are abundant: bahukantiko' '(the country) 
having abundant rivers: bahunadiko' '(the country) 
having many women : bahunariko'. 

C243 Jayaya tudam Jani patimhi. **341** 
Jayaya ice etayam tudam jani ice ete adesa honti patimhi pare. Jayaya pati : tudampati ; jayaya pati : 
j an i p a t i . 

(24) The word **jaya** followed by **pati** is changed into tudam and **jani.** 
If pati follows , the word **jaya** becomes **tudam** and Jani . Thus ; 'wife's husbands tudampati ' 'wife's husband Ehusband for wife? ] : janipati' . 

C253 **Dhanumha** ca . 34 2 Dhanumha ca apaccay o hoti samasante . Gandiv o dhanu yassa so gandivadhanva . 

(25) And a after **dhanu** (is laid down) . 

In the final of a compound the suffix a is added after the word **dhanu.** Thus : '(the person ) whos e bow is called Gandiva ; gandivadhanva' .

# Notes Iv

This chpater of samasa covers 28 rules. The word samasa is derived from sain+ asa (sam means nearly, together; asa means throw, direct, cast, shoot at, drive away); literal meaning would be : "throwing together'. Buddhappiya gives the meaning of samasa as Kaccayana does and analyses it as: "The meaning is combined, thus it is called samasa, i.e. it is 2 abbreviated". Aggavantsa explains it as: "The meaning of samasa is as follows:- the compounding (is called) 
samasa (i.e.) the abbreviation of words, or the words are combined i.e. having made or not made the elision of case—endings, abbreviated into a single word through the point of view of the words or the 1.

meaning, thus it is called samasa i.e. the words being o combined"." A.P. **Buddhadatta** explains it as; "When two or more nouns *are* combined together to form a 
- 4 grammatical unit it is called a Samasa (compound)". Aggavantsa has divided samasa by its function into two kinds: (1) **luttasamasa** (a compound in which the caseendings are dropped) (2) **aluttasamasa** (a compound in 5 which the case-endings are not dropped); by its formation into two kinds: <1) niccasamasa (the compound cannot be explained by the dissolution 
(viggaha) (2) **aniccasamasa** (the compound can be explained by the dissolution); and through the point of view of nomenclature into six kinds: (1) **Abyayibhava** 
(Adverbial) (2) **Kammadharaya (Adj**iectiva**1) (3) Digu** 
(Numerical) **(4) Tappurisa** (Determinative) (5) **Bahubbihi** (Relative) (6) **Dvanda** (Copulative).

In this chapter, Kaccayana takes Abyayibhava first and does not arrange the 28 rules into the si>: classes as stated above. **Buddhappiya** re-arranges them so that students can understand each of them easily as followsi-
(1) The rules 318-322, 343-345 fall under Abyayibhava. 

(2) The rules 326, 328, 332, 334-338 fall under (3) The rules 323, 327, 339 fall under Digu. 

(4) The rule 329 falls under Tappurisa. (5) The rules 330, 333, 340, 342 fall under Bahubbi hi. 

(6) The rules 324, 325, 331, 341 fall under Dvanda.

Kammadharaya. 

There are 28 rules in this kanda.  In the rule 319 word  ca  is to indicate  additional   grammatical the operation.  In  the  rule 320 the  word  ca  does  not indicate  additional grammatical operation.  
Ac to Rupasiddhi it refers to the grammatical process of a ending in niggahita.8  First three rules in  this word kanda  are common for all compounds.  In the  rule  322 the word so refers to abyayībhāvo occuring in the  precc napumsakalingo  and ekattam occuring in the  rules  322 and  323.

In the same rule the word ca  occurs  which according to the vutti indicates collection for ekattaṃ and napumsakalingo.  Similarly, in the rule  325  also word ca indicates both ekattaṃ and napuṃsakaliṅgo.

the I n the  rule  333  the  word ce is  significant;  it occurs rarely in Kaccāyana's work.  In the rule 334 the word  ca indicates pumā as well as bhāsitapuṁitthī  and the  rule 338 the word ca  stands  for  kussa ce.

In occuring  in the preceding rule, in the rule  338  also plural  form is significant.  In the rule 340 the the word  ca stands for ka according to the vutti.  
WE
may ssse preceding rule.  In the rule 342 the word ca  stands
--
for **samaBanta** occuring in the rule 339 which, however, does not suit the usual arrangement of Kaccayana's rules. Again in the rule 343 in the vutti the word kvaci is understood from the rule 339 which also seems to be unusual. In the final rule in this kanda the word ca is used which may indicate additional grammatical operation. 

Rule Is T adds **sariya puttos sariputto** (son of saris sariputto) after samanabrahmana. **S j^** , S2 read **samana,** 
brahmana for **samano, brahmano** and **brahmana, gahapatika** for **brahmano, gahapatiko. Bj^** adds **yannadatto pacati** after **devadatto pacati.** The semi—colon after **ranno** 
should be removed. **Samasagatanam** should be corrected to **samasantagatanam** (see the rule 22 of this chapter), 
B^ generally reads **kathina-** for **kathina-** in the entire d i scussion.

Rule 2: T, Sj_ , 52? BJL add **vibhatti** before paccaya—, 
according to the vutti the addition of **vibhatti** (caseending) is very significant. S^, ^2» ^ add dipam karoti ti dipankaro (one who makes a lamp: (or an island): dipankaro), **Bj^i dipankaro** in the vutti, T adds bhagava after **pabhankaro, amatandado, medhankaro,**

Rule 241 T, Bl j Se read **tudain** in the rule and tudampati" (Bj^i - pati) in the vutti. Si » *^2.* read **tu** 
dam in the rule and dampati (Sj^i - **pati)** in the vutti on which the author of the **Virita** - Sanne comments asj 
"In the Kaccayana-vutti and other works 
"Tudampati" is cited as an example of a compound noun Such a compound noun is not found either in the Pali Canon or in the Nirutti Pitaka. Therefore, the word has not been taken as an example here. The author of the K'acc ay ana-vu tt i without paying any consideration to the particle "tu" which signifies "an excess" 
(implied) in the sutra, "jayaya tu dam - jani patimhi" 
(2.7.94), has erred and combined it with the term "dam" and made a compound "tudampati". Later on it was 57 accepted as authoritative by others also". And Ven . 

K- Kodagoda Siri **Nanaloka,** the editor of the Payogasiddhi, further remarks: "Here the word "others" refers to the author of Rupasiddhi and others. In like manner the author of the Saddaniti in framing the sutra 
"Jayaya kvaci tudam-jani patimhi" (93) has blindly followed the same path and has cited the word 58 "tudampati" as an example". Therefore, we may accept S^t ^2's readings which seem to be closer to the original. However, **PED** records either **tudampati** or S9 - — 
dampati . ^1 » "^ read **Jaya ca pati cai** (wife and husband) as a Dvanda compound for Jayaya pati. 

Rule 25s Bj^ , **Sj^** , S2 read **gandivo, Ti gandivo** for gandivo. However, MW gives two forms i.e., **gandiva;** 
- - 60 gandiva which means 'Arjuna's bow'. **Nyp** reads kandivo; Sadd: gandivo (the variant reading **kandivo** 
also) ; **Rup: gandiva—,** but **PED** does not record any of them. I prefer the reading **gandivo** given by Bj;^ which seems to be closer to the original -
Rule 26: T reads kumbhassa samipe katha vattati ti upakumbham for **upakumbham. T** reads **pakarassa tiro:** 
tiropakaram (beyond or over (on the other side of) a fence: tiropakaram) for **tiropakaram. T** reads kuddassa tiro: tirokuddam (outside or over the wall : 
tirokuddam) for **tirokuddam, B<** reads **tirokuttaro.** T 
reads **pasadassa anto: antopasadain** (inside the palace: 
an topasadaip ) for **an topasadain** .
