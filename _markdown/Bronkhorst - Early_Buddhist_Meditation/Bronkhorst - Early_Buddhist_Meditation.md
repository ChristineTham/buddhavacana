# Early Buddhist **Meditation**

(paper presented at the conference "Buddhist Meditation from Ancient India to Modern Asia", Jogye **Order**
International Conference Hall, Seoul, 29 November **2012.)**
Perhaps I should begin with an apology. This paper is my contribution to an **international**
conference held to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Master Seongchul (or Seongcheol). I have read his *Sermon of One Hundred Days, Part One*, in the **translation**
of our host, Dr. Hwang Soon-Il, and have learned that Master Seongchul **belonged** to a tradition that held that reliance on texts and lectures must be eliminated. Yet I am a philologist, someone who bases his research on texts and on texts alone. So **when** I am going to speak about early Buddhist meditation, I will base myself only on texts, not on any experiences of my own. I am not sure whether Master Seongchul would **have** approved of this (even though I notice that he, too, was aware of the work **done** by philologists on the history of Buddhism, and used it). I would yet like to say **something** in my defence. Texts and lectures may have to be eliminated for awakening to occur, but awakening is not my purpose in this paper. My purpose is understanding, not **spiritual** understanding but old-fashioned intellectual understanding. And for this **kind** of understanding we do need our **texts.**1 Over the years I have repeatedly proposed a method to arrive at the teaching of the Buddha on the basis of the early canonical texts. I did so for the first time in my book *The* Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India, which came out in 1986, and **most**
recently in my *Buddhist Teaching in India*, which came out in 2009. An article **published**
in 1998, "Self and meditation in Indian Buddhism", gives a short summary of **this** method; it is also available in Korean translation and on the **internet.**
In the first part of the present paper I will briefly discuss what this **method**
consists in, and illustrate it with the help of some chosen examples. After that I will **offer**
some reflections on the findings that result from applying this **method.**
Put very briefly, the teaching of the Buddha as presented in the early **canon**
contains a number of contradictions. There are views and practices that are **sometimes** accepted and sometimes rejected. The method I have proposed is based on a **study** of other religious movements that are known to have existed at the time of the **Buddha** in the same region of India. It turns out that among the views and practices that are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon many are also **found**
in those other religious movements. We are therefore entitled to suspect that **Buddhism,** in the course of its development but before the final redaction of its early **canon,** underwent the influence of those movements and borrowed some of their views and practices. My proposal is to consider views and practices in the Buddhist **canon** as borrowings, and therefore as non-authentic, if two criteria are met: (1) they are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected in the Buddhist canon, and (2) they **have** their place in the other religious movements of the time. I also submit that the **original** teaching of the Buddha may have to be looked for among the views and practices **that** remain after deduction of the **borrowings.**
I know that it is no longer fashionable in modern scholarship to speak about the historical Buddha. Attempts to find out more about his person or his life have **largely**
failed, so much so that further efforts in that direction seem pointless.2 Even the **part** of his life we should know most about - his final days, his death and the **subsequent** incineration of his body - may turn out to be a pious fiction with no basis in **historical**
reality.3 Skepticism with regard to anything that touches the historical Buddha **seems**
therefore justified. This explains that many scholars prefer to speak of the **teachings** of early Buddhism, rather than of the teachings of the **Buddha.**
Here, I think, we should be careful not to push our skepticism too far. The Buddhist tradition maintains that the Buddha had a new message, whereas his **followers** did little beyond preserving this message. We know that the situation was not **quite** as simple as this, and that the followers of the Buddha introduced numerous novelties in the course of time. But there is no virtue in denying that the historical Buddha had a new message. If, therefore, our investigation of the earliest sources brings to light new **ideas**
and new practices, ideas and practices that apparently did not exist in India before the appearance of the Buddha, it is bizarre to ascribe those novelties to the early **followers** of the Buddha rather than to the founder himself. This is why I will not speak of **early** Buddhism, but about the teachings of the historical **Buddha.**
Let us consider some concrete examples. If the early Buddhist texts agree on one issue, it is that the Buddha taught suffering and the cessation of suffering. **This** is repeated numerous times, beside being incorporated in the so-called Four Noble **Truths.** Moreover, to the best of my knowledge there are no passages in the ancient canon **that** contradict this. I therefore propose to attribute this to the historical Buddha: he **taught** suffering and the cessation of suffering. I take this as point of departure for our **further** reflections.

Many modern scholarly publications ignore this central point without the **least**
explanation or justification, and present another goal, such as: the Buddha **taught** a method to arrive at an experience of enlightenment. I look upon such **claims** as illustrations of the temptation to impose one's own views on the old texts.4I try not to **fall**
into this trap. I am, of course, aware of the fact that one can never free **oneself** completely from one's presuppositions and cultural baggage. I do however think **that** it is the task of the philologist to try, and that progress can be made, on condition that we **stay** close to the texts and carefully scrutinize all notions that we introduce and that do not come straight from those **texts.**
The early texts, then, are straightforward about the aim of the Buddha's **teaching.**
They are less straightforward about the manner in which one supposedly reaches the goal, i.e., the cessation of suffering. As a matter of fact, we find here a variety of **methods** that do not always agree with each other. Some of these can collectively be **referred** to as meditation, and I will concentrate on these in particular, given that Buddhist **meditation** is the theme of this conference. The details of the forms of meditation described in the canon differ considerably from each **other.**
I will first give three examples of religious practices that are sometimes **criticized**
and sometimes accepted in the early Buddhist texts:5 The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, in its various recensions, records a discussion of the Buddha with someone called Putkasa (in Sanskrit) or Pukkusa (in Pāli). The Buddha here boasts that once, in a **violent**
thunderstorm when lightning killed two farmers and four oxen near him, he did not notice it. Abilities of this kind were claimed by certain non-Buddhists, according to the testimony of the Buddhist texts. Another Buddhist Sūtra (the Indriyabhāvanā *Sutta* of the Pāli canon and its parallel in Chinese translation), however, ridicules such **'cultivation** of the senses' which leads to their non-functioning; the Buddha is here reported to say **that**
if this is cultivation of the senses, the blind and deaf would be cultivators of the **senses.**
My second example is the following:6 The Vitakkasanthā*na Sutta* of the **Majjhima** 
Nikāya and its parallels in Chinese translation *recommend* the practicing **monk** to
'restrain his thought with his mind, to coerce and torment it'. Exactly the same words are used elsewhere in the Pāli canon (in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta, Bodhirājakumā*ra Sutta* and Saṅgā*rava Sutta*) in order to describe the *futile* attempts of the Buddha before his enlightenment to reach liberation after the manner of the Jainas. It is **tempting** to conclude that these Jaina practices had come to be accepted by at least some **Buddhists.** This second example appears to concern a detail of certain Jaina **practices.**
Our third example is even clearer. It concerns practices which certain **Buddhist**
texts explicitly ascribe to Jainas and criticize, and which are confirmed by the Śvetāmbara Jaina canon. In spite of this, they are a number of times attributed to the Buddha himself.7 A Sūtra of the *Majjhima Nik*āya (the Cūḷ*adukkhakkhandha Sutta*) and its parallels in Chinese translation describe and criticize the Jainas as **practicing** 'annihilation of former actions by asceticism' and 'non-performing of new actions'. **This** can be accepted as an accurate description of the practices of the Jainas. But several **other**
Sūtras of the Buddhist canon put almost the same words in the mouth of the Buddha, who here approves of these practices. It is, once again, tempting to conclude from **this** contradiction that non-Buddhist practices - this time it clearly concerns Jaina **practices** - had come to be accepted by at least some Buddhists, and ascribed to the **Buddha**
All these three examples have something in common. All three describe **practices**
that are variations of a common theme that might be characterized as **"suppression** of activity". Suppression of activity was a reaction to the conviction that all activity **leads** to karmic retribution, a belief accepted by Jainism and other religious movements at the time. Buddhism, it turns out, though accepting the doctrine of rebirth and **karmic**
retribution, accepted it in a form different from Jainism: Buddhism did not accept that all physical and mental activity necessarily has a consequence, most probably in a **future** life. The authentically Buddhist practices were not therefore variations of the **attempt** to stop all physical and mental activity, as was the case in Jainism and elsewhere. **However,**
the Buddhist canon provides ample evidence that the suppression of activity **exerted** a certain influence on at least certain early monks and nuns. This explains that **such**
practices found their way into the **canon.**8 The three examples given above are no more than illustrations for the **method**
elaborated in my books. It would take us too far to deal with all the details, and if you wish to know more about them, I must refer you to those books. Here we must turn to the next question: What remains if we deduct the practices and ideas that are due to Jaina and other influences? I proposed the following answer in my *Two Traditions* (1993: **95):**
[W]hat remains that can be considered authentic Buddhist meditation? … The Four Dhyānas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants survive the present analysis easily. I know of no indications that they too must be looked **upon** as due to outside influence. Moreover, they occur very frequently in the **canonical** scriptures and already made the impression on other investigators of **belonging** to the oldest layers of the **tradition.**
Closely connected with the Four Dhyānas is the practice of 'mindfulness' (smṛ**ti /** 
sati). Mindfulness is mentioned in the description of the Four Dhyānas, but is **also**
independently described in the canon. [… There] is no reason to doubt its **role** in original Buddhism, for mindfulness is nowhere criticized in the Buddhist **canon,** nor does it conflict with other practices accepted by the **Buddhists.**
 

8 These three examples have been taken from my article "The Buddha and the **Jainas**
reconsidered", which came out in 1995 in the *Asiatische Studien*. Ultimately they derive **from** my book *The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India*. However, the article is more **interesting**
in the present context, because it also deals with alternative ways to explain these **same**
contradictions, presented by Professor Richard Gombrich, from Oxford University, in an **article**
that also came out in the *Asiatische Studien* (Gombrich, 1995). As it so happens, **Professor**
Gombrich had invited me to compare and confront our views in two separate articles in **that**
journal, of which I was an editor at the time. This confrontation was an occasion for me to **rethink** my positions and learn from alternative ways of looking at the contradictions in the **Buddhist**
canon. In the end I decided that there was no need to abandon my views, at least not yet.

Let me, to refresh your memory, read a part of what Schmithausen (1981) calls the
"stereotyped detailed description of the Path of Liberation". This description is **repeated**
numerous times in the canonical Sūtras, more often than one might think if one use the texts of the Pali Text Society, this because the description is there often **replaced** by a peyyāla, an indication to the extent that a passage is repeated, without telling **which**
passage is repeated. For our present purposes it is most important to note that **this** description resists for the most part all the tests of authenticity which I have **proposed.**
The part I'll read deals with what we might call meditation. It **reads:**9 Abandoning longing (*abhidhy*ā, Pa. *abhijjh*ā) for the world, he dwells with a **mind** (*cetas*) free from longing; he purifies his mind (*citta*) from longing. **Abandoning**
ill will (vyāpāda) and hatred (*pradve*ṣa, Pa. *padosa*), he dwells with a mind **free**
from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning dullness (styāna, Pa. thīna) and drowsiness (*middha*), he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, having **clear** consciousness (ālokasaṃ*jñin*), mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness (*auddhatya*, Pa.

uddhacca) and remorse (kaukṛtya, Pa. *kukkucca*), he dwells free from **agitation**
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt (*vicikits*ā, Pa. *vicikicch*ā), he dwells having **gone** beyond doubt, unperplexed (akathaṃ*kathin*) about wholesome mental **properties**
(kuś*ala dharma*); he purifies his mind from **doubt.**
Having thus abandoned these five hindrances (nī*vara*ṇa) and the **secondary**
defilements (*upakle*śa, Pa. *upakkilesa*), secluded from sensual pleasures, **secluded**
from unwholesome mental properties (akuś*ala dharma*), he enters and **dwells** in the first stage of meditation (dhyāna, Pa. jhāna), which is **accompanied** by deliberation (*vitarka*) and reflection(vicāra), with pleasure (prīti) and joy (*sukha*)
born of seclusion (*vivekaja*). **[...]**
Again, with the subsiding of deliberation and reflection, a monk enters and dwells in the second stage of meditation, which has internal **quiet**
(adhyātmasaṃ*pras*āda, Pa. ajjhattaṃ sampasā*danam*) and unification of **mind** (*cetasa ekot*ībhāvaḥ, Pa. *cetaso ekodibh*āvo) without deliberation and **reflection,**
with pleasure and joy born of concentration(samā*dhija*). **[...]**
Again, with the fading away as well of pleasure, he dwells **equanimous**
(upekṣaka, Pa. *upekkhaka*) and mindful (smṛ*timat*, Pa. *sata*) and fully **aware** (saṃprajānat, Pa. *sampaj*āna), he experiences joy with the body; he enters and dwells in the third stage of meditation, of which the noble ones (ārya, Pa. *ariya*)
declare: "He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells joyfully." **[...]**
Again, with the abandoning of joy (*sukha*) and suffering (duḥkha, Pa.

dukkha), and with the previous passing away of joy (*saumanasya*, Pa. *somanassa*)
and dejection (*daurmanasya*, Pa. *domanassa*), he enters and dwells in the **fourth**
stage of meditation, which is neither suffering nor joyful and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity (upekṣāsmṛtipariś*uddhi*, Pa.

upekkhāsatipā*risuddhi*).

The crucial transition comes next, and is described as **follows:**10 When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he **directs**
it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints (āsravakṣ*ayajñ*āna, Pa. ā*savakkhayañ*āṇa). He understands as it really is: "This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering."' He understands as it really is: "These are the taints. **This** is the origin of the taints. This is the cessation of the taints. This is the way **leading** to the cessation of the **taints."**
When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of **desire**
(kāmā*srava*, Pa. kāmā*sava*), from the taint of existence (bhavā*srava*, Pa.

bhavā*sava*), and from the taint of ignorance (avidyā*srava*, Pa. avijjā*sava*). **When**
[the mind] is liberated there comes the knowledge: "I am **liberated."** He understands: "Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, so that I will not again return **here."**
I tend to think that this passage contains the most authentic information we can **derive** from the Buddhist canon about meditation and what it leads to. For reasons I have **hinted** at earlier, I also propose that the contents of this passage correspond to the **teaching** of the historical Buddha about **meditation.**
I concluded my book *The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India*, back in **1986,**
with the following **words:**
We have come as far as philology could take us, it seems. For a **further** understanding of Buddhist meditation, philology will probably not be of **much** help. An altogether different approach may be required to proceed further. **Such** a different approach does not fall within the scope of the present book. I may **return** to it in another **study.**
More than twenty-five years have passed since I wrote these words, and it is time to try to fulfill my promise. If you accept what I have written over the years, there are implications to be explored that go beyond philology. These implications **concern** meditation and its possible **results.**
Our point of departure has to be the finding - and we start from the **assumption**
that it is one - that the historical Buddha claimed that there is a method to put an end to suffering. This method included forms of meditation of which we have relatively **precise** descriptions. At this point we have to make a choice. Either we assume that all we can derive from ancient texts is information about the beliefs and fantasies of its **authors,** which had no link to reality. In that case we must conclude that there was a man, **more**
than two thousand years ago, who probably sincerely, but nonetheless **mistakenly,**
believed that he had put an end to his suffering, and that he had found a **method** to do so that would in principle be usable by others. This belief could then be added to all the other beliefs that people have adhered to over the centuries in the name of religion, all of them at bottom **mistaken.**
The alternative is that we, at least provisionally, stop imposing upon the texts our presuppositions as to what they are all about. In that case we have to consider the possibility that this same man, more than two thousand years ago, had actually put an end to his suffering and had found a method to do so. If we accept this second **scenario,** we are confronted with something quite extraordinary and perhaps unique in human **history.** In this second case we are also faced with the question how this could be **possible.** If it is really possible to put an end to suffering by following a certain method, we may **have** to rethink the way humans function. We will in that case also have to consider what **role** meditation plays in the **process.**
Buddhist meditation attracts a great deal of attention these days, not only **among**
lay people, but also among brain specialists and other scientists.11 This scientific **interest**
in Buddhist meditation understandably concentrates on the study of living **Buddhist** meditators. Philologists and historical scholars in general are more or less excluded **from** this field of research. This is a pity, because one would like to know whether the **brain** scientists study the same kind of meditation as the one, or perhaps rather the ones, in the plural, that figure in the texts that philologists study. And we would of course all **wish** to know whether the brain scientists study the kind of meditation that the Buddha **practiced** and taught so many centuries **ago.**
At first sight, this seems unlikely. Robert Sharf has convincingly argued **(1995)**
that it is far from clear how many Buddhists actually meditated in historical **times,**
perhaps far fewer than is often supposed,12 and that much the same is true even of **those**
who wrote about meditational states: it is virtually unheard of in classical **Buddhist** literature that an author speaks about his or her own meditational experiences. It **might** therefore seem understandable that textual scholars play at best a marginal role in the scientific investigation of Buddhist **meditation.**
As understandable as it may seem, I think that textual scholarship can **contribute**
to the debate, and may indeed come up with essential information that may **conceivably** put the scientific study of Buddhism on a new footing. The textual **scholarship** I am referring to is of the kind I have just **outlined.**
The early Buddhist texts, as we have seen, present a method to put an end to suffering and rebirth. This goal is the prime context provided by those texts, **which** no philologically sophisticated interpretation of the texts should be allowed to ignore. **Part** of the method consists of meditational practices. It follows that these meditational **practices** are not an aim in themselves; they are the means to bring about a permanent state **that** is free from psychological suffering.13 (I will leave rebirth out of consideration). They are not a means to bring about pleasant meditational states (or to be more successful in **life),**
but a means to bring about a psychological transformation that will secure **that**
psychological suffering will no longer be part of one's life, whether one be in a meditational state or **not.**
Since confusion can easily arise in this matter, I allow myself a **simple**
comparison. A traveler who has traveled from Germany to Italy and leaves **indications** for his friends how to accomplish this journey is likely to say a great deal about the **Alps,** the mountain range that lies between these two countries. Uninformed readers of **these** indications may think that our traveler wants to describe the Alps, that he encourages his friends to visit the Alps. Of course, he has no such intention. Our traveler could not but describe the Alps, because only by crossing the Alps does one travel from **Germany** to Italy. The meditational states in the early Buddhist texts correspond to the Alps in **this** comparison: they have to be gone through in order to reach the real destination, **viz.,** a lasting state that is free from psychological **suffering.**
The central claim of these texts, then, is that a complete, and **lasting,**
psychological transformation is possible, and that this transformation has been **attained** by the historical Buddha (and perhaps others). The decisive phase of this **transformation,** the texts add, was accomplished in one single night. This transformation is the goal, and the meditational practices described in the texts are part of the method to reach that **goal,** and no **more.**
This simple observation should, all by itself, be of interest to **scientists.** It is of course possible to maintain that the central claim of the early Buddhist texts is no **more** than fantasy, a confusion between dream and reality for which some well-meaning but ultimately misguided monks, or even the Buddha himself, must be held responsible. **This** is possible, but by no means necessary or self-evident. There is nothing in the claim **that** goes against established knowledge, whether it be scientific or historical **knowledge.** Moreover, the early Buddhist claim is quite unique, even in India (with the **exception** of later currents that have clearly been influenced by Buddhism), so that one cannot **claim** that it was simply taken over from another movement. I therefore propose not to be **hasty** in rejecting what is, after all, central to the ancient texts and in a way their very **reason** of existence.

A lasting psychological transformation must have a neurological **counterpart,**
presumably in the form of a lasting transformation of the brain, or of some of its **parts.**14 The crucial part of this transformation of the brain has yet taken no more than one **night**
to be accomplished; the early Buddhist tradition appears to be unanimous about this. **This** may be taken to mean that the neurological changes that correspond to this **radical** psychological transformation may well be relatively minor. Unfortunately the **working** brain of the Buddha is not available for scientific investigation, but if it were, it **seems** likely that the difference from other brains would be hard to **spot.**
These simple reflections support the following conclusion: We must assume **that**
psychological processes have neurological counterparts, but even major **psychological** transformations may not leave clearly identifiable traces in the brain. In order to **gain** a deeper understanding of the processes involved, we need more than only **information** about the brain, we also need a psychological theory, i.e., we need to know how the **mind** "works". This psychological theory should not just be short-hand for **neurological** processes, nor do we want mere folk psychology (or worse: **psychobabble).** Understanding brain processes is not sufficient to understand psychological **processes,** least of all when major transformations like those referred to in the early Buddhist **texts** are concerned. We need a psychological theory that is yet scientific in the **strictest**
sense.15 The reason why we need a really thought out and tested psychological **theory** is that without it we will be in danger of carelessly using intuitive and **experiential** impressions, and end up with some kind of pop-psychology that has no **more** to recommend itself than its intuitive appeal to some of us. This danger is as great for **those** who swear by the importance of brain research on meditators as it is for **others.** To illustrate the danger of proceeding without a scientific psychological theory, I **will** discuss a concrete **example.**
Meditators sometimes comment upon the intense joy they experience in **certain**
meditational states. Having no established psychological theory to fall back on, **some** of them refer to certain forms of Buddhist thought and claim that bliss is part of the **natural**
state of consciousness.16 This so-called explanation is of no use to neurological **research,**
nor can it be tested in any other way. In fact, it does not explain anything whatsoever, for it does nothing beyond stating that the bliss experienced in certain states is **"natural".**
Contrast this with an observation made in the early Buddhist texts. They **talk**
about the bliss experienced in certain meditational states as resulting from **absorption**
(samā*dhi-ja*). Absorption, as I use the term, is effortless attention or **concentration.**17 Many meditators know that bliss may result from it. A study of mystical literature **leads** to the same conclusion: Bliss, when it occurs, is always accompanied by absorption. **This**
simple observation has never attracted serious attention.18 But obviously, if bliss **arises**
from absorption, there is no need to postulate that bliss is part of the natural **state** of consciousness. Indeed, there is no need to make hypotheses about the **nature** of consciousness at all. It suffices to hypothesize that bliss, or more generally **pleasure,** results from **absorption.**
This last hypothesis - which comes straight from the early Buddhist **texts,** as we have seen - is a lot more amenable to empirical verification, or refutation, than the one that claims that bliss is part of consciousness. Mystics and meditators experience **their** bliss in a state of absorption, but others, less privileged, too, experience their **pleasures** in states of relative absorption. It is true that mystics and meditators may heighten **their** degree of absorption to a level unattainable by most, and that as a result their **degree** of pleasure or bliss is higher, too. This does not change the fact that lower **degrees** of pleasure, the levels that we all know from everyday experience, are **accompanied** by absorption, even though the degree of absorption in these cases is low. **Drawing** inspiration from the early Buddhist texts, we may hypothesize that pleasure is not **simply**
accompanied by absorption, but is actually *produced* by it; this is the **meaning** of samā*dhija* in the passage read earlier. And we can refine the hypothesis by giving it **this**
form: absorption gives rise to pleasure, and the degree of pleasure corresponds to the degree of **absorption.**
Here, then, we have a starting point for what could become a truly **psychological**
theory. For pleasure is a motivating force that is responsible for at least part of **human** behavior. We might tentatively go further and postulate that much of human mental and physical behavior is carried out in the pursuit of pleasure.19 More concretely, **human**
behavior seeks to reestablish situations that were accompanied by pleasure on **earlier**
occasions. The human mind is presumably programmed such that situations, or **objects**
(including persons), whose experience is accompanied by pleasure become **desirable** thereafter, and future activity will seek to find them back, or at least find situations and objects that share features with those earlier pleasurable **ones.**
I am fully aware that the scheme I am presenting here can at best only be a **very**
simplified picture of what really happens in real human beings. The **number** of pleasurable and unpleasurable experiences we, all of us, have had from an early age onward is so great that the number of motivating forces that interact at any one **time** in a normal person, and that are based on the memory of those experiences, must be very **high** indeed. However, even this simplified picture shows that human motivation is **ultimately** based on a mistake. We have proposed that pleasure results from absorption, not, or not directly, from the situations, objects and persons that our memory retains as **sources** of pleasure. These situations, objects and persons were retained in our minds because **they** were experienced as pleasurable. However, they were not its direct cause, because the (or at least one) direct cause of pleasure is **absorption.**
I do not delude myself in thinking that the theory of which I have just **presented**
the briefest possible outline can be considered complete. Other factors, too, will **have** to be taken into account, but this is not the place to do so. However, even the bit **that** we have considered puts a number of issues in a different perspective. Suppose **that** it is indeed true that absorption, through the intermediary of pleasure, plays a crucial **role** in the workings of the mind and in human behavior in general. In that case one can **conceive**
of a person who has discovered the real source of pleasure, viz., absorption, and who has also succeeded in eliminating - or perhaps we should say: deflating - the **memory** traces that pull him or her to the situations and objects that had been associated **with** pleasure in the past. This person would then know the real source of pleasure and be **free** to act in accordance with that knowledge, quite independently of his or her **life**
experience.

This takes us back to our point of departure. I emphasized that the claim that **there**
is a possible enduring state free from psychological suffering is central to the **early** Buddhist texts. I also drew attention to the need of a psychological theory over and **above** the findings of brain research. Well, the theory I have just outlined provides us **with** a fascinating glimpse of what freedom from psychological suffering might look **like** in terms of this theory. It consists in the "discovery" of what constitutes the real **source** of pleasure, and in the modification, "deflation", of memory traces that pull us **toward** mistaken sources of pleasure. This theory does not need to assume that the **psychology** of the Buddha, or of any person in that state, works according to altogether **different** principles than us. If the pursuit of pleasure is a major force in the mental and **physical** activity of ordinary humans, we do not have to postulate that the situation is **different** in the case of the Buddha. The essential difference lies in the fact that pleasure, in **this** particular case, is no longer mistakenly associated with earlier experiences in the **world**
and with the resulting attachments, but with its real source, **absorption.**20 Let me emphasize once again that I have done no more that minimally **sketch**
some notions that might be developed into a full psychological theory. Numerous **further** questions remain to be answered, among them the following: Why should the **mere** realization that absorption produces pleasure not suffice to put a definite end to suffering? And why does absorption not come about automatically? Why do we, or **most**
of us, have to *learn* to meditate? The full psychological theory I am hinting at **would**
cover much more than the few suggestions I have made so far. It is however clear **that** even the skimpy outline I have presented makes more sense of the main message of the early Buddhist texts than any other theory I am aware of.21 I would further suggest **that**
the availability of a sophisticated psychological theory elaborated along the **lines** indicated above would be a useful guide for the study of the brain processes that **underlie** the psychological transformations referred to in the Buddhist **texts.** By way of conclusion, I like to emphasize that I am not a Buddhist. I do not **"believe"** in the texts we have been discussing, and I would not protest if someone were to **show**
(which no one has done so far) that the contents of the early Buddhist texts are **just** a bunch of more or less incoherent ideas, invented perhaps by some dreamers who **lost** touch with reality. The one thing I "believe" in (if this is the term to use) is **that** philologists should take their texts seriously. They should, to the extent possible, **avoid** approaching them with the conviction that they already know what is in them. The **point** of my presentation is that, if one seriously attempts to read the early Buddhist **texts** without projecting one's own prior convictions onto them, one may end up **with** questions and challenges of the kind I have presented to **you.**
There is another consequence of taking the texts seriously. Countless **scholars**
have edited, translated and studied the numerous passages that state that a **transition** to a state free from suffering is possible. To the best of my knowledge, none of them **have** ever taken position with regard to this claim. I do not remember having read a **single**
scholar stating that he does not believe this claim. And yet, it seems clear that **many**
scholars, including probably most Western scholars, do indeed not believe this **claim.** They somehow assume that their readers, too, will reject this claim without further **ado.** I think this is patronizing, and leaves the door wide open for the cultural prejudices of the scholar. Everyone is free to believe, or not believe, what he wishes, and I have no **dispute** with people who reject the early Buddhist claim, with or without arguments. I do **have** a disagreement with those who sneakily introduce their prejudices, preferably **without** mentioning them, for example by ignoring as not worthy of serious attention a claim **that,** if true, might shake our understanding of human nature in its **foundations.** References:
