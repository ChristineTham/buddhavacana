## About Hamburg Buddhist Studies

Ever since the birth of Buddhist Studies in Germany more than 100 years ago, Buddhism has enjoyed a prominent place in the study of Asian religions. 

The University of Hamburg continues this tradition by focusing research capacities on the religious dimensions of South, Central, and East Asia and making Buddhism a core subject for students of the Asien-Afrika-Institut.

Today, Buddhist Studies as an academic discipline has diversified into a broad spectrum of approaches and methods. Its lines of inquiry cover contemporary issues as much as they delve into the historical aspects of Buddhism. Similarly, the questions shaping the field of Buddhist Studies have broadened. Understanding present-day Buddhist phenomena ‒ and how such phenomena are rooted in and informed by a distant past ‒ is not at all an idle scholarly exercise. Rather, it has become clear that fostering the understanding of one of the world's major religious traditions is a crucial obligation for modern multicultural societies in a globalized world.

Accordingly, *Hamburg Buddhist Studies* addresses Buddhism as one of the great humanistic traditions of philosophical thought, religious praxis, and social life. Its discussions are of interest to scholars of religious studies and specialists of Buddhism, but also aim at confronting Buddhism's rich heritage with questions the answers to which might not easily be deduced by the exclusive use of historical and philological research methods. Such issues require the penetrating insight of scholars who approach Buddhism from a range of disciplines, building upon and yet going beyond the solid study of texts and historical evidence.

We are convinced that *Hamburg Buddhist Studies* will contribute to opening up the field to those who may have no training in the classical source languages of the Buddhist traditions but approach the topic against the background of their own disciplinary interests. With this book series, we encourage a wider audience to take an interest in the academic study of the Buddhist traditions.

## About This Volume

We are proud to welcome Carola Roloff's monograph on the ordination of nuns in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition to the Hamburg Buddhist Studies series. Her contribution is remarkable in at least two regards. Firstly, her critical edition introduces the Tibetan texts and their English translations of two important chapters in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya: the Chapter on Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī (*Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu) and the Manual for Buddhist Nuns' Ordination (*Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti). Secondly, based on the presented materials, the author discusses ways in which the nuns' ordination in the Tibetan tradition—from which full ordination for women has been absent for centuries—may be legitimately reinstated. This is a concern Carola Roloff has been supporting for more than two decades. 

Her edition and exegesis of the Tibetan texts and their Sanskrit parallels constitute a solid foundation for discussing why the Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī lineage should be re-established and how concrete steps in that direction may look like. 

The topic has elicited controversial debate, and has often been criticized; in that to advocate full ordination of nuns would mean to rely only on the arguments of interpreters of later centuries, i.e. on secondary authorities and not on the canon itself. The present study, in contrast, evidences that the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya itself contains chapters of utmost relevance to this issue. These important parts of the Vinaya have been edited and translated in this volume and should be fully taken into account in future exchanges. The publication of these new and momentous insights will contribute to the advancement of these important discussions and serve to promote a view which is, on the one hand, based on solid evidence of the monastic code of the early times, while on the other hand, also addresses central issues of the modern world such as the equality of gender in society and religions.

## 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives And Initial Questions

This publication presents results of a research project funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), entitled "The Buddhist nuns' ordination in the Tibetan canon."
1 Conducted from January 2010 to July 2017, the aim of the project was to examine the rituals and regulations for the full ordination of Buddhist nuns (Tib. *dge slong ma*, Skt. *bhikṣu*ṇī)
2according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda Buddhist monastic code. This is the code that was followed in India in a school of the same name, and that today regulates monastic life in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions. As such, the possibility of granting (or denying) full ordination to women in Tibetan Buddhism hinges on the interpretation of this monastic code. 

The Buddhist tradition holds that the Buddha himself introduced highest ordination or full ordination (Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa*, Skt. upasa*ṃpadā*) for women. From India, the order of fully ordained nuns expanded to several other countries where various versions of the monastic code, or Vinaya, were used to regulate monastic life. In Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam, the nuns' order followed the Dharmaguptaka school and its monastic code. In India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, the nuns' order died out in the 11th/12th century, whereas in some other Buddhist countries, such as Thailand and Tibet, there are no clear records indicating that the nuns' order had arrived there from the Indian subcontinent in the first place. 

In more recent times, efforts have been made among Buddhists worldwide to reintroduce full ordination for women in the Tibetan and the Theravāda tradition, not least because this is expected to enhance the role of women in society, and improve human rights for much of Asia. These efforts have met with decidedly mixed response, and full ordination for women is currently still denied to women in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition that is followed by Tibetan Buddhist monasticism. In July 2007, at the prompting of the Dalai Lama, an international congress on the role of Buddhist women in the Saṅgha was convened at the University of Hamburg to discuss the question of granting full ordination to women according to the *Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya*. 

During that conference it became clear that there are substantial differences among the surviving Vinaya schools that need to be considered when the prospect of reviving the Theravāda and Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda bhik*ṣuṇī* lineages is examined.

Compared to Theravāda Buddhism, the revival of nuns' ordination in Tibetan Buddhism is made more complicated by the fact that the tradition seldom refers directly to the original Vinaya texts found in the Tibetan canon of texts sourced to the Buddha, or "Kanjur." Instead, in recent centuries, Tibetan monk scholars have come to rely mainly on Vinaya commentaries by Tibetan authors, which rely in turn on the exegetical texts by Guṇaprabha and other Indian authors. These exegetical texts are located in the Tanjur, a collection of Tibetan translations of Indian commentaries that are understood not to have come from the Buddha, but are nevertheless also held as authoritative by Tibetans. Furthermore, Tibetan interpretations of the Vinaya draw heavily on non-vinaya theory, to wit: Vasubandhu's Abhidharmak*ośabhāṣ*ya. 

There is a saying in Tibetan monasteries that one cannot understand the Vinaya without having studied the Abhidharma.

Arguments on issues of monastic code are far more likely to quote an Abhidharma text, comments by the Indian scholar Guṇaprabha or a native Tibetan text than they are to quote the Buddha himself. As a result, the interpretation of Vinaya rules by Tibetan scholars considering the question of full ordination for women is mediated by multiple layers of textual authorities. Such texts are granted their authority through historical processes that inevitably reflect hermeneutical preferences and social biases, which seldom worked in favor of opportunities for women. The loss of full contact with the original Vinaya texts, and the tendency to repeat instead the tiny subset of passages from them favored by later interpreters, has resulted in a narrowing of view that has left many options out of consideration.

As one example, at the time that research for this present project began, numerous contemporary Tibetan Vinaya scholars, including the abbot of an important monastery in India, were unaware that a manual for conferring full ordination on women exists in the Kanjur canon itself - that is to say, they were unaware of the existence of the manual edited and translated in this present book. As we shall see, this manual lays out the procedural requirements for ordaining women and as such stands to resolve a great deal of the current lack of clarity surrounding the issue. In the absence of awareness of this important primary source, discussions of women's ordination generally have drawn on commentaries of earlier commentaries in which only a few selected passages from this original text are cited. The publication of the women's ordination manual in this present volume (see Chapter 3), as well as the account of the first *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination (see Chapter 2), may serve to 1) facilitate access to this important original source, 2) allow us to read oft-cited passages in their original context, and thus 3) serve as a balance against the heavy reliance on decontextualized citations and multiple layers of intervening interpretations.

From the outset, major questions animating the research project included: 
To what extent do the later exegeses by Tibetan commentators coincide with the Indian sources from which they draw their authority, specifically those of Guṇaprabha? How do the positions taken in both Indian and Tibetan commentaries compare with the treatment of nuns' ordination in the *Bhikṣu*ṇīvastu*,
3found in the Kṣ*udrakavastu* within the Tibetan Kanjur? 

What new perspectives might come to light when we examine the procedures and precedents regarding *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination in their original context, rather than viewing them as decontextualized passages or refracted through the multiple layers of later interpretation?

It soon became clear that we lacked the needed textual basis for such an analysis and that any serious study must first create that base. To that end, this monograph consists of the critical edition of the Tibetan and its annotated English translation of the so-called Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā*,
4or more precisely, the Chapter on Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī (*Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu*)
5(chapter 2) and the Manual for Buddhist Nuns' Ordination (*Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti)* 6(chapter 3) which are both found in the Kṣudrakavastu (*Phran tshegs kyi gzhi*, lit. "Section on Minor Matters") of the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya (*Gzhi thams cad yod par smra ba'i 'dul ba*).

The critical annotation of the Tibetan text draws attention to points of divergence with the Sanskrit and Chinese versions of the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* (where these are available), while noting major variation from the handling of similar points in the Pāli Vinaya. The English translation is aimed at encouraging further research by other scholars and at the same time supporting ongoing dialogues within the broader Buddhist communities regarding possibilities of offering full ordination to women in Tibetan Buddhism.

With the textual material established, this study will explore the impact that the aforementioned processes of selective exegesis have had on female Buddhists aspiring to live a monastic life. It will argue that because such textual practices have clearly complicated efforts to revive the Buddhist nuns' ordination, both the texts in question and their uses by the Tibetan tradition must be taken into consideration in order to adequately address the issue of the feasibility of full ordination for women, as will be discussed in chapter 4 below. That chapter will demonstrate that there are at least two, and possibly three, ways to revive the nuns' ordination in Tibetan Buddhism that could be considered valid according to the texts analyzed in this publication. As historical background, the most important developments concerning the revival of the Buddhist nuns' order during the last thirty years will also be presented. As will become clear, while the Tibetan consensus on issues related to nuns has evolved in recent years, what has remained constant is the reliance on authoritative textual sources as the touchstone for decisionmaking - and the fact that the primary authorities are commentators subsequent to the Buddha.

In general, the application of the Vinaya to evolving socio-historical conditions is, by definition, a matter of interpretation. Over the centuries, changing social contexts prompted many new questions, which Tibetan Vinaya scholars tried to answer systematically, in the spirit of good scholasticism. In the process, later authors wove passages from earlier authors into an ever-tightening net of arguments, which - being now part of the tradition ‒ cannot be escaped. Today, efforts to address the new questions raised by a completely different socio-political and cultural context, in which gender equality is taken for granted, cannot simply ignore textual authorities but must examine them from a fresh hermeneutic perspective. This is achieved by recovering the original texts, as we do here. Once available, we can evaluate in their original context the passages so often cited by later commentators, query the uses made of them by their interpreters, and compare how other Vinaya traditions have handled similar points.

## 1.2 Primary Sources

1.2.1 The Tibetan Translation of the Kṣudrakavastu, and the Vinaya 

## Terminology Utilized

Among the different Vinaya renditions, the *Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya* (MSV) is considered to be youngest, "probably compiled in the first or second century C.E. in northwest India" (Schopen 2004: 573; Schopen 2014: 416, 434), but we do not know when this Vinaya was closed. Lamotte (1958: 196) 
states: "As for the *Mūlasarv. Vin*. which devotes two Skandakas to a full and coherent biography of the Buddha, it did not originate from an old Buddhist community established in Mathurā from the first century of Buddhism - as E. Frauwallner claims (p. 37) - but from an immense compendium of discipline which was closed very much later and was probably compiled in Kasmīr in order to complete the *Sarvāstivādin Vinaya*." That notwithstanding, according to Gregory Schopen, the Sanskrit MSV contains very early material. Furthermore, it is the only Vinaya for which we have significant amounts of actual manuscript material from perhaps the sixth or seventh centuries (Dutt 1939: 42; Schopen 1997: 25; Langenberg 2013: 45–47, Kieffer-Pülz 2014: 50–52).

The Tibetan translation of the Kṣ*udrakavastu* comprises two volumes of the Kanjur.

7 The translation work was divided among numerous translators. 

Those bearing the primary responsibility were the Indian *upadhyāya*s Vidyākaraprabha and Dharmaśrīprabha and the Tibetan Lo tsā ba bande dPal 'byor. 

Hence dPal 'byor, the chief translator of the Kṣ*udraka,* was a contemporary of both.8 Vidyākaraprabha also revised the first translation of the *Vinayavastu,* together with dPal brtsegs. Unlike the *Vinayavastu,* the Kṣ*udrakavastu*, 
which forms separate volumes of the Kanjur, was not revised subsequently. This raises the intriguing possibility that the terminology used therein may reflect an earlier draft, so to speak, of Tibetan Vinaya understanding. 

According to Herrmann-Pfandt (2008: xxii) dPal brtsegs was one of the first seven Tibetan men *(sad mi bdun)*, to receive upasa*ṃpadā* from the Bengali abbot of Nālandā University, Śāntarakṣita, in the year 779 in bSam yas.9dPal brtsegs also co-authored the *Mahāvyutpatti* (Mvy) in the year 814, along with 'Khon Klu'i dbang po. According to Nyingma history 'Khon Klu'i dbang po was also one of the seven to receive upasa*ṃpadā* from Śāntarakṣita. 

Curiously, given the fact that dPal brtsegs worked on both texts, the Vinaya terminology found in the Kanjur is not always in agreement with the Vinaya entries in the Mvy, as Hu-von-Hinüber has shown (1994: 57; 1997: 
343). Instead the compilers of the Mvy apparently used Guṇaprahba's Vinaya*sūtra* and its Tibetan translation as the basis for their translations of Vinaya terminology.

10 In the Kṣ*udraka* in particular, in several cases the vocabulary differs from the standards laid down in the Mvy.

11 Such discrepancies are indicated below, in the critical apparatus to the English translation.

The tradition presumes that the transmission of the MSV explanation *('dul* ba'i bshad rgyun) and the transmission of the MSV *prātimokṣ*a vows *(so thar* sdom rgyun) were both introduced to Tibet by Śāntarakṣita (725-788 CE), who was the first abbot (*upādhyāya*) of bSam yas, the main Tibetan monastery at that time. He went from Nepal to Tibet for the first time in about 763, and again resided there from about 775 to the time of his death (Seyfort Ruegg 1981: 88). Thus, at a first glance, it seems possible that the texts in the Kanjur Vinaya were already translated in the 8th century.

## 1.2.2 Principal Texts Considered

A Sanskrit parallel is extant for significant portions of the Tibetan translation of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā* and is catalogued as a fragment (Sanskrit ms. c.25(R) of the Bodleian Library Oxford. This 25–folio Sanskrit text (six folios are missing) was edited by Ridding and la Vallée Poussin in 1920, and re-edited by Schmidt (1993) for the *Sanskrit-Wörterbuch der buddhistischen* Texte aus den Turfan-Funden (SWTF). This text was originally identified as belonging to the Sarvāstivāda school but was later determined to belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school. Thus, it was only considered in the beginning for that dictionary project but later excluded.12 The manuscript was initially obtained in India by August Hoernle at the end of the 19th century. It seems to stem from Nepal and may be dated as early as the 11th century.13 This supports Skilling's suggestion that the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage was present in the Kathmandu Valley up to that time.

14 A partially abbreviated translation of this Sanskrit Bhikṣuṇīkarma-*vācanā* has been published by Frances Wilson in Diana Paul's Women in Buddhism (1985: 77–105). That translation is not entirely free of inconsistencies.

The present study of the evolution of the first *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination is based on collating 13 different Kanjur editions of the Tibetan translation of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā* section in the Vinayakṣudrakavastu ('*Dul ba phran* tshegs kyi gzhi), that largely corresponds to the Sanskrit fragment of the Bhikṣuṇīkarma*vācanā*, as it has been preserved in ms. c.25(R) of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford and with the corresponding section in the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya*, to the degree that it is preserved in Chinese translation. All Sanskrit and Chinese parallel fragments are identified as part of the critical apparatus to the text edition. (See 1.2.3 Introduction to the Tibetan text edition for greater details on the criteria used in preparing the text edition.)
Along with a critical edition of the Tibetan, this present publication includes an annotated English translation of the Tibetan Bhikṣuṇīkarma-*vācanā* or more precisely the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu* and the Manual for Buddhist Nuns' Ordination (*Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*) as found in the Kṣudrakavastu (Phran tshegs kyi gzhi) of the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya (Gzhi thams cad yod par smra ba'i '*dul ba)*. The translation into English is based on critical editions of both parts of the Tibetan text at the beginning of the
*Bhikṣuṇīvastu (see Appendix for tabular overview). On many occasions, a comparison of passages in the Manual for Buddhist Nuns' *Ordination*
(*Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñ*apti*) with the *Manual for Buddhist Monks*'
Ordination (Bhikṣūpasaṃpadājñapti) in the MSV yielded interesting insights, which are noted in the critical apparatus. In the process of preparing the English translation, especially for those passages in which no Sanskrit equivalent was extant, it proved useful to consult Tibetan translations of Indian Vinaya commentaries. Later commentaries often cite the Abhidharmakośa or Indian Vinaya commentaries, as mentioned above, and these texts were also investigated where relevant.

Among those Indian commentarial sources considered, the comparison of the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti with the corresponding Tibetan translation of Guṇaprabha's Ekottarakarma*śataka* (Tib. *Las brgya rtsa gcig pa*) was indispensable. In fact, however, the latter is not a commentary *per se*, but rather a paraphrased reproduction of the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñ*apti* in which one finds that many of the Vinaya terms are rendered with different Tibetan terminology than are found in the actual *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñ*apti* itself. The Sanskrit parallel of the Ekottara*karmaśataka* is considered to be lost. However, because Guṇaprabha is held by Tibetans to be the most authoritative Indian Vinaya commentator, his text is an important touchstone for any discussion of this issue. Thus, it cannot be ascertained whether the underlying Sanskrit terminology differed between the two texts or whether the Tibetan translations favored a different terminology for the same Sanskrit Vinaya terms. Intriguingly, numerous Vinaya terms employed in the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñ*apti* differ from both the Bhikṣūpasaṃpadājñ*apti* and the *Mahāvyutpatti*. In any case, the variant rendering of important Vinaya terms proved informative where a conclusive understanding of the underlying terms had not been reached.

As useful a resource as it would be, a reliable translation of Guṇaprabha's Ekottarakarma*śataka* section on the bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination would require not only a critical edition of the respective *Tanjur* editions of the Tibetan text, but also a comparison with the presumed Chinese parallel, as so far we have no corresponding Sanskrit parallel. It should be noted that the Chinese text that contemporary Chinese/Taiwanese *Dharmaguptakavinaya* nun scholars consider to be the canonical Mūlasarvāstivāda version of the **Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti* may well turn out to be instead a Chinese translation of the respective parallel in the Sanskrit Ekottarakarma*śataka*, which only the Tibetan tradition attributes to Guṇaprabha. No author is named in this Chinese text, but its translator was Vinaya master I-tsing (635–713 A.D.) in 710 A.D. A comparison of these two texts would be a valuable contribution but remains to be a desideratum. 

The Chinese translation of the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu* is found in T. 1451[24] 350b8–351c1015 while the respective parallel to the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* in the Ekottarakarma*śataka* in its Chinese translation is to be found in T. 1453.

16 The śrāmaṇerikā-, śik*ṣamāṇā*- and *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination rites are missing from the Bhikṣuṇīkarmav*ācanā* in Chinese T. 1451[24].

Although most of the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* thus has no equivalent in the Chinese MSV, according to Chung, there is a correspondence (in content) 
to the Chinese *Ekottarakarmaśataka* in T 1453[24] 459c13–465a19. Bhikṣuṇī Wei-chun has produced an English text based on this and other Chinese translations of the MSV (2007: 1).

## 1.2.3 Introduction To The Tibetan Text Edition

This project started in January 2010 with an extensive collection of Kanjur material and the compilation of concordances in table form. This was followed by an analysis of the *Bhikṣu*ṇīvastu* (especially Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā*) including a survey of the literature on the critical edition of Vinaya texts in the Kanjur and on the *Vinayakṣudrakavastu (Tib. 'Dul ba phran tshegs kyi gzhi). Subsequent to that, new material constantly became available for consideration, such as the Tokyo manuscript (Ms.) of the Toyo Bunko Oriental Library, the Shey manuscript from Ladakh by Prof. Dr. 

Helmut Tauscher, the Kangxi Kanjur, the Jang sa tham edition, and two "new" manuscripts (Mss.) ‒ Bka' 'gyur rgyal rtse'i them spang ma and Bka'
'gyur pe cin par ma tshal pa (both published by Koyama, Shinagawa ku, Tokyo, Japan: Digital Preservation Society (DPS) and kindly provided during a visit in the Library of the Columbia University in New York City).

Finally, a decision was made to sample-collate thirteen Kanjur editions 
(LRTNHSZFQKJBD) for the first five folios of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā* (see Table 1 with Sigla Annex, Appendix 1). A list of the thirteen Kanjur editions is included below on p. 12–14. The collation was based on an unpublished text edition that had been drafted by Jin-il Chung, based on five Kanjur editions. This draft was compared word-by-word with the originals, and partly corrected. New Kanjur editions were collated subsquent to that, for a total of thirteen. In a later phase of the project, in consultation with Prof. 

Dr. Johannes Schneider (Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften Munich), 
the apparatus, which had originally been a negative apparatus, was reconfigured as a positive apparatus with the kind help of Christof Spitz 
(Hamburg), so that all textual witnesses and their stemmatical relationship were clearly recognizable, and no textual witness was overlooked.

The decision to include further Kanjur editions proved to be welladvised,17 because it allowed new and lesser-known editions to be classified more precisely. Christof Spitz entered the readings of these editions into a database and compared them with the Kanjur stemma proposed by Helmut Eimer (1992, xviii–xix). The results were evaluated in talks with Prof. Dr. 

Johannes Schneider (Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften Munich) and Prof. Dr. Dorji Wangchuk (Professor for Tibetology, University of Hamburg). On this basis, a final determination was made in 2016 as to which editions should be favored in the critical edition of the Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*. Seven Kanjur editions (RLSJKQD) were selected, and these included not only the oldest tangible text witnesses of the two main lines of tradition Them spangs ma (Western group/ branches) and *Tshal pa* (Eastern group/ 
branches) in the stemma, but also the two later editions *Stog* (S) and Peking 1737 (Q), which were suitable for the clarification of certain passages. In the course of the work, Mr. Eimer's stemma proved to be correct, so that the preparation of a different stemma was not necessary.

The criteria for producing the text edition presented in this volume include content, language, and textual criticism. This edition takes into account not only the Tibetan sources, but also the preserved parts of the critical edition of the corresponding Sanskrit manuscript (Schmidt 1993). 

The primary aim was to reproduce the text as faithfully as possible and in a legible form. This edition will be published separately in Tibetan script together with the Sanskrit text in Devanāgarī script, to make the results of the present research more accessible to Tibetan native scholars. The current grammatical and orthographical standards of the Tibetan language were applied for this purpose, since the religious-historical, Buddhist studies, and partly also "reflexive praxis" question are major concerns of this project, rather than solely seeking to reconstruct a presumed Tibetan original text (archetype), preserving its orthography as faithfully as possible. For this reason, this edition takes readings from both main traditions of the Tibetan canon, and the contaminated Derge edition of 1733 (D) has also been retained, as it is an important testimony to a Tibetan process based on the Tshal pa tradition, but often emended after readings of the Thems spang ma editions.

We found excessive divergence among Kanjur editions, and against the Sanskrit, in the section concerning obstructive conditions (Tib. bar chad kyi chos rnams, Skt. *āntarāyikā dharmāḥ*) for the ordination. Thus, in Appendix 1 (Table 2) we provide a concordance table of the different versions of the list of questions regarding obstructive conditions in the Tibetan editions, in the Sanskrit manuscript, and in the edition of the *Handbuch für Mönche*
(Manual for Monks) published by Chung. Based on this a consolidated version of the list of questions was produced and appears as the English translation.

The 13 Kanjur editions of the Tibetan Bhikṣuṇīkarmavācanā (*Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu* and *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti) in the Kṣ*udrakavastu* are as follows:18

For the purposes of this publication, our text will be handled in two parts. Part One comprises the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* and appears as chapter 2. Part Two comprises the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* and appears as chapter 3. The Buddha was addressing his remarks to Ānanda up to the conclusion of the text *Mahāprajāpatīgaut*amīvastu*, at which point the granting of ordination of Mahāprajāpatī is complete. This forms Part One of our present text. At the opening of Part Two, the Buddha's interlocutor changes to Upāli, who queries the Buddha as to the procedure for ordaining the remaining women.

We may note here that the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* is often referred to as the "foundation history of the nuns' order" (cf. Anālayo 2016), based on a sentence that appears at the conclusion of the Chinese text but that is missing from the Tibetan. No Sanskrit is extant for this passage, unfortunately. However, it is important to note that in the Tibetan text, by the end of the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* only Mahāprajāpatī has become a bhikṣuṇī, while the numerous Śākyan aspirants accompanying her apparently remain un-ordained. Thus, as far as the Tibetan version of the MSV is concerned, strictly speaking, since a sole *bhikṣu*ṇī does not constitute a saṃgha, it would be incorrect to refer to this text as the foundation history of the bhikṣuṇī saṃ*gha.* Rather, the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* is most precisely described as an account of the first bhikṣuṇī ordination. As we shall see from the text that follows the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu*, in the MSV 
it is only in connection with this subsequent text − *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* − that a bhikṣuṇī saṃgha, i.e., a community of at least four *bhikṣu*ṇīṣ, comes into being. Therefore, the rites regarding full ordination for women can best be understood in the context of both the *Mahāprajāpatī-*gautamīvastu* and *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*. This will be explored in further detail in the critical apparatus and in chapter 4. 

The **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* is found in the following sections of the Kanjur editions. Note that the forward slash below indicates the end of Part One and the end of the opening section of Part Two, in which Upāli appears and the Buddha explains that subsequent ordinations should proceed in stages, as outlined in the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*.

## 1.3 Acknowledgements

The research was carried out and fully funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). The help of this esteemed organization is gratefully acknowledged. My special thanks for their contributions to the results of the project go especially to my partners and colleagues at home and abroad, Dr. 

Damchö Diana Finnegan, Prof. Dr. Tashi Tsering, Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup, Prof. Dr. Ann Heirman, and Dr. Petra Kieffer-Pülz.

Particular thanks go to my colleague and dear friend Dr. Damchö Diana Finnegan (University of Wisconsin-Madison) whose doctoral dissertation 
(2009) focused on narratives from the MSV in Sanskrit and Tibetan. During her extended visits as a guest scholar in Hamburg, we compared the Tibetan line-by-line with Schmidt's Sanskrit edition (1993). Along with her editing of the English text, this publication was enriched by the many hours spent together in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2019, discussing difficult points both the translation and of ordination procedure.

Prof. Dr. Ann Heirman (University of Ghent) kindly offered her time and expertise during visits in 2010 and 2011 to compare the Tibetan translation of the Bhikṣuṇīkarmavācanā (*Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu* and *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*) with the Chinese parallel passages.

From the very beginning, in 2009, Prof. Dr. Michael Zimmermann played a key role in initially offering me a Research Fellow Position at the Numata Center for Buddhist Studies, and convincing me to apply for a DFG grant. He has remained supportive through the end.

Thanks to an invitation by the Vice Chancellor of the Central University for Tibetan Studies (CUTS), Professor Geshe Ngawang Samten, and Professor Lobsang Norbu Shastri, I was able to participate in the International Vinaya Conference at CUTS Sarnath, Varanasi, from January 17–
19, 2011, together with Ven. Bhikkhunī Dhammanandā (former Prof. Dr. 

Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, Thammasat University Bangkok) and Ven. Prof. em. Dr. Heng-ching shih, National Taiwan University Taipei). During this visit I also laid the groundwork for my subsequent research stay in India from September 2011 to February 2012. From October to January, as I had done while conducting research for my PhD thesis at the CUTS, I met daily with the Tibetan monk scholar Prof. Dr. Ācārya Tashi Tsering to clarify questions on Tibetan Kanjur and Tanjur texts on *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination, to read Tibetan commentaries on the same issue, and to compare the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣuṇīk*armavācanā* manuscript with my text edition of the Kanjur parallel. I truly enjoyed these regular meetings and our exchange. Toward the end of my stay Prof. Tsering encouraged me to also meet with Prof. Yeshe Thabkhey and Prof. K.N. Mishra on several days. My research stay in Sarnath was most kindly facilitated by the former CUTS librarian Ācārya Jampa Dhadak. Dr. Thea Mohr (Frankfurt), with whom I was preparing the International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Saṃgha at the University of Hamburg 2007, introduced us to each other in Dharamsala (India) in 2006. To all of them, including those not mentioned here by name, I express my deep thanks. I am very grateful for the time I was able to spend with each of them.

A Karl H. Ditze Foundation advancement award enabled me to hold two highly fruitful colloquia during my research period in India with a total of 24 monk scholars from all six colleges of the three major Gelugpa monastic universities ‒ Sera, Drepung, and Ganden ‒ in southern India. These colloquia were held in close cooperation with the Abbot of Sera Je Monastery in South India, the late Geshe Lobsang Palden, and the Vinaya expert Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup, and with the logistical assistance of the Jangchub Choeling Nunnery, Tibetan Colony, Mundgod, Karnataka State, India.

In October 2012, I was kindly invited by the Department of Religion and Culture of the Central Tibetan Administration to present my research results to a committee of Tibetan monk scholars at the Sarah Institute, in Himachal Pradesh, India. My three-hour lecture in Tibetan was followed by an intensive exchange with the monk scholars lasting several days. This occasion, along with the countless meetings with Tibetan monk scholars during the previous research trips, provided many important opportunities to debate my own interpretations of difficult points and to deepen my understanding of Tibetan Vinaya hermeneutic strategies.

In 2013, when I shifted from the Numata Center for Buddhist Studies to the Academy of World Religions, both of Hamburg University, Prof. Dr. 

Wolfram Weiße provided the ongoing encouragement that has allowed me to bring the project to its conclusion. 

The same year, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) generously provided additional material funding that permitted Christof Spitz to devote 80 hours per month for 18 months to work on the critical edition of the Tibetan. His participation greatly enriched the project, making possible the inclusion of the *Berlin manuscript* edition of the Peking-Kanjur in the collation of the aforementioned editions of the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu*, and to convert the format of the original critical apparatus into a positive apparatus. The guidance of Prof. Dr. Johannes Schneider, professor for Indology at the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Wörterbuch der Tibetischen Schriftsprache) was most valuable in determining the most effective approach to creating the ciritical edition.

The kind support and participation of Birte Plutat, M.A., Research Assistant at the Library of the Asien-Afrika-Institut of the University of Hamburg, was indispensable in the creation of a bibliographic database. The online bibliography on the subject "The Buddhist Nuns' Ordination in the Tibetan Canon" has now been made available to interested researchers, scholars, and the general public.

22 Additional thanks are due as well to my project assistants, Ise Gaiza and Sarah Höhner, who worked on this project for several years.

This project has benefitted from countless contributions of numerous scholars, who have improved this project in ways ranging from sharing rare reference material to discussing terminology to advising on text variants. A 
warm thanks to Prof. Dr. Jens-Uwe Hartmann, Dr. Petra Kieffer-Pülz, Dr. 

Jin-il Chung, E. Gene Smith, Prof. Dr. Paul Harrison, Dr. Helmut Eimer, Prof. Dr. Helmut Tauscher, Prof. Dr. Shayne Clarke, Dr. Ralf Kramer, Dr. 

Alexander Schiller, Prof. Dr. Cristina Scherrer-Schaub, Prof. Dr. Jay L. 

Garfield, Prof. Dr. Petra Maurer, Prof. Dr. Dorji Wangchuk, Prof. Dr. 

Harunaga Isaacson, Dr. G. Paul Hackett, Dr. Peter Gäng, and Geshe Michael Roach. Among the many gestures of support and kindness that have contributed to this present volume - too numerous to detail here - I might single out Prof. Dr. Ulrike Roesler (University of Oxford) for individually scanning in color the folios of the Sanskrit manuscript at the Bodleian library, Dr. Kazuo Kano (Kōyasan University Japan), for providing me with a microfilm of the relevant passage in the Toyo Bunko Kanjur, as well as Bruno Lainé (University of Vienna), who kindly provided facsimiles of the relevant volumes of the Jang sa tham during my research stay in India 2011/12, a time when the scans were not yet available online and were quite difficult to attain.

## 2 The First Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

This chapter studies the narrative of the first ordination of a woman and other events related to the presence of ordained women within the Buddhist community, as recounted in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya.* This presentation is compared with the Sanskrit and Chinese Mūlasarvāstivāda parallels.

1

## 2.1 The First Bhikṣuṇī Saṃgha And The Evolution Of The Manual For Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

The history of the *bhikṣu*ṇī order begins with an account of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's requesting and finally receiving permission to become a nun. It then describes the way in which she became a *bhikṣu*ṇī by accepting the eight gurudharmas. While the different Vinayas agree in broad terms with this initial presentation, they show some differences in their description of ensuing events regarding the manner in which the women accompanying her became ordained, at which point an order of bhik*ṣuṇī*s came into being.

2 In what follows, at first, the Mūlasarvāstivāda version of these events is taken up, based on a critical edition of the Tibetan3and Schmidt's re-edition of the Sanskrit manuscript (1993) that was initially edited by Ridding and de La Vallée Poussin (1920). This is followed by chap. 2.1.2, which comprises an English translation of the Tibetan texts that includes an annotated analysis and discussion of the significance of this narrative.

For a response on this matter, see Anālayo (2008). However, for the present study, this question is not pivotal, since all traditions discussing the possibility of the revival of *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination nowadays (Theravāda and Tibetan traditions) take their respective accounts in the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition to be canonical, that is, they take their accounts to present the words of the Buddha (*buddhavacana*) 
and thus cannot simply dismiss any of its contents on a philological, historical or any other basis.

'ba' zhig (pa la) corresponds to Skt. *kevalaṃ*. The addition of pa la in I.1.3 and I.1.5 seems plausible as a locative particle, in the sense of "in this [way of life] as a lay woman alone you should perfect … the *brahmacarya*". But here 'ba' zhig seems to be understood as an adverb to the verb spyod pa, in the sense of "to practice purely."

## I.1 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Request For Admission To The Order I.1.1 Gautamī'S Encounter With The Buddha In Kapilavastu

The Buddha,6the Bhagavān,7 was staying in Kapilavastu in the Nyagrodha8 grove. Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, accompanied by 500 women of the Śākya clan, then went to where the Bhagavān was, bowed with her head at the feet of the Bhagavān and sat down to one side. While she was seated off to one side, 9the Bhagavān advised Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī in the right way10 [by means of] a dharma talk,11 he instructed her in the right way, encouraged12 her in the right way, and delighted her in the right way.

## I.1.2 Gautamī'S Request For Admission Into The Order

Having correctly advised her in various ways by means of a dharma talk, instructed her in the right way, encouraged her in the right way, and delighted her in the right way, he fell silent.13 Mahāprajāpatī arose from her seat, placed her palms together toward the Bhagavān, and made obeisance to the Bhagavān. Then she said the following to the Bhagavān: "Venerable, 14 then, if it is the case that it is possible for a woman to attain the four fruits of a *śramaṇa*,
15 please allow women to go forth and fully ordain in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya,16 and then practice bhikṣuṇīhood and lead the way of pure life (*brahmacarya*) in the presence of the Bhagavān" Thus she spoke.

## I.1.3 The Buddha'S Rejection

Then the Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī: "Gautamī, 17 wear the white clothes of a housewife,18 and practice only19 in that way, as long as you live, the pure way of life, fully perfected, pure, perfectly purified.20 This will be conducive to your long-term objectives, benefit, and happiness."

## I.1.4 Gautamī'S Repeated Request

Again Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī asked the Bhagavān thus a second and third time: "Venerable, then, if it is the case that it is possible for a woman to attain the four fruits of a *śramaṇa*, please allow women to go forth and fully ordain in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, and then practice bhikṣuṇīhood and lead the way of pure life in the presence of the Bhagavān." Thus she spoke.21

## I.1.5 The Buddha'S Repeated Rejection

Again a second and a third time, the Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī: "Gautamī, wear the white clothes of a housewife, and practice only in that way, as long as you live, the pure way of life, fully perfected, pure, perfectly purified. This will be conducive to your long-term objectives, benefit, and happiness." Thus he spoke, and when the Bhagavān had not consented even a third time, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī bowed with her head at the feet of the Bhagavān and departed from his presence.22

# I.2 Gautamī'S Second Request For Admission Into The Order

## I.2.1 Gautamī'S Encounter With The Buddha In Nādikā

Then, having stayed at Kapilavastu for as long as he liked, the Bhagavān took up his alms bowl and his robes (Tib. *chos gos,* Skt. *cīvarāḥ*)
23 and set out on tour to the region of Nādikā.

24 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī heard that the Bhagavān, having stayed at Kapilavastu for as long as he liked, had taken up his alms bowl and his robes and set out on tour to the region of Nādikā.

25 Having heard this, [she and] the 500 women of the Śākya clan accompanying 
[her]26 shaved their heads by themselves27 and put on robes (Tib. *chos gos,* 
Skt. *cīvarāḥ*). Having their heads shaved and wearing a patched garment
(Tib. *sbyar ma*, Skt. *sa*ṃghāṭī*),
28 they followed the tracks of the Bhagavān to where he had stopped overnight and went there.

29 Thus, the Bhagavān wandered through the Vṛji 30 territory and went to Nādikā. In Nādikā he stayed in the place [called] Guji.31 Then too Mahāprajāpatī, physically [fully] exhausted, tired, weary, her body covered with dust, went to where the Bhagavān was,32 bowed with her head at the feet of the Bhagavān, and sat down to one side. While she sat off to one side, the Bhagavān correctly advised Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī by means of a dharma talk, instructed her in the right way, encouraged her in the right way, and delighted her in the right way. Once he had correctly advised her in various ways by means of a dharma talk, instructed her in the right way, encouraged her in the right way, delighted her in the right way, he fell silent.

## I.2.2 Gautamī'S Request For Ordination

Then Mahāprajāpatī arose from her seat. She placed her palms together toward the Buddha and made obeisance to the Bhagavān. She then said the following to the Bhagavān: "Venerable, then, if it is the case that it is possible for women 33 to attain the four fruits of a *śramaṇ*a, please allow women to go forth and fully ordain in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, and then practice bhikṣuṇīhood and lead the way of pure life in the presence of the Bhagavān."
Thus she spoke.34

## I.2.3 The Buddha'S Rejection

The Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī: "Gautamī, practice only in that way, as long as you live, with your head shaved and wearing a patched garment (Tib. *sbyar ma*, Skt. *saṃghāṭī*),
35 the pure way of life, fully perfected, pure, perfectly purified. This will be conducive to your long-term objectives, benefit, and happiness." 36

## I.2.4 Gautamī'S Repeated Request

Once again, a second and third time, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī said the following to the Bhagavān: "Venerable, if it is the case that it is possible for women to attain the four fruits of a *śramaṇa*, please allow women to go forth and fully ordain in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, and then practice bhikṣuṇīhood and lead the way of pure life in the presence of the Bhagavān" Thus she spoke.37

## I.2.5 The Buddha'S Repeated Rejection

Again a second and third time, the Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī: "Gautamī, practice only in this way, as long as you live, with your head shaved and wearing a patched garment, the pure way of life, fully perfected, pure, perfectly purified. This will be conducive to your long-term objectives, benefit, and happiness."38

## I.3 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī And Ānanda I.3.1 Ānanda Learns Of The Buddha'S Rejection I.3.1.1 Gautamī'S Grief

Then, after Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī had been denied permission by the Bhagavān a second and a third time, 39 [Skt. she bowed with her head at his two feet and walked away from the vicinity of the Bhagavān.]40 She then remained outside, beside the entrance way, 41 weeping and shedding tears.42

## I.3.1.2 Ānanda Asks For The Reason

Then the Venerable Ānanda saw Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī outside, beside the gate, weeping and shedding tears. Seeing this he asked43 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, "Gautamī, why are you staying outside, beside the entrance way, weeping and shedding tears?"

## I.3.1.3 Gautamī'S Response

She spoke thus: "It is as follows, Venerable Ānanda: women 44 are not permitted to go forth (*pravrajyā*) in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, attain full ordination, and bhikṣuṇīhood."
45

## I.3.1.4 Ānanda Offers His Help

"Gautamī, in that case, stay here, while I ask the Bhagavān."

## I.3.2 Ānanda As Mediator I.3.2.1 Ānanda'S Request For Ordination On Behalf Of Gautamī

Then the Venerable Ānanda went to where the Bhagavān was, bowed with his head at the feet of the Bhagavān and sat down to one side. Sitting off to one side, Venerable46 Ānanda asked the Bhagavān: "Venerable, if it is the case that it is possible for women to obtain the four fruits of a *śramaṇa*, please allow women to go forth and fully ordain in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, and then practice bhikṣuṇīhood and lead the way of pure life in the presence of the Bhagavān."47

## I.3.2.2 The Buddha'S Rejection And His Reason For It

[The Bhagavān answered:] "Ānanda, do not ask that women go forth in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, attain full ordination and become *bhikṣuṇī*s.

Why do I say this? Ānanda, if women go forth in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, the Dharmavinaya will not last long. 48

# I.3.2.3 Three Similes For The Reason Of His Rejection

## I.3.2.3.1 Simile Of A Household With Many Women And A Few Men

"Ānanda, it is as follows. For example,49 a household in which there are many women and few men50 is easily attacked and overwhelmed by robbers and kidnappers.

51 Likewise, Ānanda, if women go forth into the Dharmavinaya, it will not last long.

52

## I.3.2.3.2 Simile Of The Destruction Of A Rice Field

(This paragraph is missing in Phu brag and all Tshal pa editions FQKJB)
women are allowed to go forth, the Buddha's teaching will not last long.'" 
(Anālayo 2016: 211) But then, from here, the MSV differs in sequence from the Pāli Vin II 256, Cv X.1.6, in that the Buddha makes this prediction not before he gives the eight *gurudharma*s, but after he has given them and thus ordained Mahāpajāpatī. See Horner (1938‒1966: v. 356), and in comparison, the Theravāda Aṅguttara-nikāya version in Anālayo (2016: 132, 233–234).

49 Lit. Ānanda. It is (Tib. de) like this (Tib.*'di lta ste*), for instance (Tib. *dper na*). 

Sanskrit lacks "for example", having only "tadyathā" = *'di lta ste*.

50 Unlike the Sanskrit and Tibetan, the Chinese version mentions men first and then women.

51 Cf. Finnegan (2009: 314n601): "*bandhusteyānām*; Tibetan: *mi la rku ba rnams*. 

The Tibetan seems to take this not as families who are thieves ‒ 'robber bands' as Frances Wilson renders it in her translation in Paul (1985: 84) ‒ but those who steal away family members, or kidnappers." Chin.: "the house will be broken in by evil thieves." The simile of robbers and abductors who attack and overwhelm a household with many women and few men could conceivably anticipate the possibility of a social backlash if there is a substantial increase in the number of women choosing to join the order, thus opting out of the few other social roles open to them at the time of the Buddha. On discussion of such backlash, see Finnegan (2009: 326).

52 Chin.: "The going forth of the women will destroy the right teaching just like that." For a detailed comparative study of the Chinese versions of these similes or predictions, see Heirman (2001: 281–284).

Ānanda, it is as follows. For example, if a fierce53 hailstorm falls on a field with fully grown *śāli* rice, the *śāli* rice will be ruined, thoroughly ruined.54 Due to ill luck, it will become destroyed. Likewise, Ānanda, if women go forth into the Dharmavinaya, it will not last long.

55

## I.3.2.3.3 Simile Of The Ruin Of Sugarcane

"Ānanda, it is as follows. If a fully grown field of sugarcane of a farmer is affected by a plague of mildew, the sugarcane fieldswill be ruined. They will become spoiled. Likewise, Ānanda, if women go forth into the Dharmavinaya, it will not last long."
56

## I.3.3 Approval Of The Buddha

The Chinese (T. 1451[24] 350c19–21; c21–25) has here the following two passages (I.3.3.1–2), which have no parallel in Sanskrit or Tibetan, but do have a parallel in the Pāli Vin II 253–254, Cv X.1.2–3, Horner 1938‒1966, v.354. See also Anālayo (2016: 212).

# I.3.3.1 Ānanda'S Reminder Of Gautamī'S Kindness To The Buddha57

## I.3.3.2 Debt To The Mother58 I.3.3.3 Purpose Of The Eight Gurudharmas

"However, Ānanda, I have established59 eight *gurudharma*s for women, which should be observed by women for their whole life, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds].

60 57 Chinese here reads: "The venerable Ānanda further said to the Buddha: 'Mahāprajāpatī has truly done a great kindness in relation to the Blessed One. When the Buddha's mother had passed away, [Mahāprajāpatī] raised him with her milk until he grew up. Will the Blessed One not accept her out of compassion?'" (Anālayo 2016: 212).

58 Chinese here reads: "The Buddha said to Ānanda: 'This matter is true. [Yet] I 
have already recompensed her completely for the great kindness she has done toward me. Because of me, she has come to know the three jewels, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community. She has taken the five precepts. 

In regard to the nature of the four truths, she will never again have doubt or perplexity, she has attained the fruit of stream-entry and will eradicate duḥkha on realizing freedom from [future] births. Kindness like this is even more difficult to requite; [gifts] of robes, food, and so on cannot compare with that.'" (Anālayo 2016: 212). Cf. Ohnuma (2006) for an argument that this debt owed to the mother for her care was one of the main reasons why the Buddha agreed to the ordination of Mahāprajāpatī. However, in this version of the account, it is clear from the Buddha's response that he considered that debt to have been discharged already.

59 Sanskrit has the present tense: I establish. 60 'Containment' here translates the Tibetan verb *dgag pa,* which in turns translates the Sanskrit *āvaraṇa*, while 'preventing the exceeding [of bounds]' translates mi 'da' bar bya ba, literally, non-exceeding or non-transgressing, which in turn translates *anatikramaṇa*. The coming simile indicates the function of keeping water in the place one wishes it to be. The phrase 'in order to contain and prevent the exceeding [of bounds]' does not appear in the Chinese translation. This is confirmed by Ānalayo's translation (2016: 213).

## I.3.3.4 Comparison Of The Eight Gurudharmas With A Dam

"For example, Ānanda, when the rainy season has ended, in the autumn, a farmer61 will dam the river or channel.

62 Because the water is contained, it will not exceed [bounds].

63 Accordingly, Ānanda, I will establish64 eight gurudharmas in order to contain women's faults65 and prevent the exceeding 
[of bounds]. Let women keep them for life.

## I.3.4 The Eight Gurudharmas I.3.4.1 First Gurudharma

"What are the eight?66 61 Literally, a farming householder - Tib. *khyim bdag zhing pa*. Skt. kārṣaka gṛhapati.

62 Tib. *chu bo'am yur ba*; Skt.: *nadīmukhe vā kulyāmukhe vā* ‒ at the mouth of the river or channel. The term *mukhe* does not appear in the Tibetan.

63 Chin. *add.*: "Their being laid down by me is like a solid dyke made by a farmer at the end of the summer period and the beginning of autumn, not allowing the water to flow beyond the rivers and canals, so that it will be sufficient for irrigating the seedlings everywhere in the field." (Anālayo 2016: 213).

64 In Sanskrit as above present tense: I establish. 65 The Tibetan is alone in inserting the term "faults"; Tib. *nyes pa*, which does not appear in the Sanskrit MSV. Nor does it occur in the Chinese MSV, nor the Pāli Vinaya. The Sanskrit MSV here reads: "It is as follows, Ānanda. When the rainy season has ended, during the autumn season, a farmer should build a dam at the mouth of a river or at the mouth of a channel. Just as this is for the sake of blocking 
(containing) the water and so that there is no overflowing (exceeding of bounds), so too, Ānanda, for the sake of containment and so that there is no exceeding [of bounds], I prescribe eight *gurudharma*s for women, which women should observe for their whole lives." Sch 244 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 4 b3–4. As a point of comparison, the Mahāsaṃghika-*Lokottaravādin Vinaya* makes no mention either, of faults of women, but compares the *gurudharmas* to a dyke that holds back water, and likens the way in which the *gurudharma*s perform this containment to how the shore contains the ocean (Roth 1970: 16 § 12). For a fuller discussion and translations of this passage from all the exant Vinaya traditions, see Anālayo 2016: 91–94.

66 Note that the order of the *gurudharma*s is different in the Pāli Vinaya. For a detailed study, see Jin-il Chung (1999). Of special importance is the difference between the first *gurudharma* here and the sixth *gurudhamma* in the Pāli Vin II 
"Ānanda, after women have received the going forth (p*ravrajyā*) and the higher ordination (upasa*ṃpadā*) from *bhikṣu*s, they should understand well67 that they [attained] bhikṣuṇī*hood*. Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the first *gurudharma* in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

The Tibetan differs here from the Sanskrit, which reads:
[Skt.: "Which eight? "Ānanda, the going forth, higher ordination, and bhikṣuṇīhood should be expected68 by a woman from bhikṣus. Ānanda, accordingly, I establish the first *gurudharma* for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding 
[of bounds]. Women should observe it for life."]
255.19, Cv X.1.4, Horner 1938‒1966: v.355): "When, as a probationer, she has trained in the six rules for two years, she should seek ordination from both Orders 
(*dve vassāni chasu dhammesu sikkhitasikkhāya sikkhamānāya ubhatosaṅghe* upasam*padā pariyesitabbā*)." Cf. Tsedroen & Anālayo (2013: 747).

67 Tib. *rab tu rtogs par bya ba'o*.

68 Skt. *pratikāṃkṣitavya*. The Tibetan *rab tu rtogs pa* does not appear to be a translation of this term, or we can say, at a minimum, that it does not seem to draw on the usual understanding of its meaning. Cf. Mvy 6382 *pratikāṃkṣitavyaḥ*, Tib. 

re bar bya ba 'am 'dod par bya ba 'am shes par bya ba, whereas the attested Sanskrit that *rab tu rtogs par bya ba* translates elsewhere *is pratīyate*, according to Negi. Skt. *kāṃkṣ* "to wish for, to desire" has the same meaning as *icchati* or eṣ as appearing in the corresponding Pāli Vinaya term *pariyesitabbā*, whereas the Tib. *rtogs pa* means to understand or to realize. See for example Mvy 998 saṃkalpa - yang dag p*a'i rtogs pa* - MW: *saṃkalpa* - m. (ifc. f.) conception or idea or notion formed in the mind or heart, (esp.) will, volition, desire, purpose, definite intention or determination or decision or wish for (with loc., dat., or ifc.). 

## I.3.4.2 Second Gurudharma

"Ānanda, *bhikṣuṇī*s should seek the teacher's instruction69 from the *bhikṣu*s 70 every half month.71 Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the second *gurudharma* in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.72

## I.3.4.3 Third Gurudharma

"Ānanda, *bhikṣuṇī*s 73 should not enter the rainy-season retreat in a residence 
(Tib. *gnas*, Skt. *āvāsa*74) where there are no *bhikṣu*s.

75 Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the third *gurudharma* for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.76

## I.3.4.4 Fourth Gurudharma

"Ānanda, when *bhikṣuṇī*s are concluding their stay in the rainy-season retreat, they should perform the *pravāraṇā* 77 in both *saṃgha*s, with regard to three points (*sthāna*):78 what they have seen, heard, or suspected. Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the fourth *gurudharma* for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.79

## I.3.4.5 Fifth Gurudharma

"Ānanda, when a *bhikṣu* has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle, a *bhikṣuṇī* should not reproach80 him or remind him [of that].

81 Bhikṣuṇīs are not permitted to reproach or remind a *bhikṣu* who has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle. However, it is not prohibited for *bhikṣu*s to reproach or remind *bhikṣuṇī*s who have failings in their discipline, failings in their view, failings in their behavior, or failings in their lifestyle. Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the fifth *gurudharma* for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding 
[of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.82

## I.3.4.6 Sixth Gurudharma

"Ānanda, a *bhikṣuṇī* should not revile83 a *bhikṣu*. She should not antagonize84 him. She should not upbraid him. Ānanda, I do not permit a *bhikṣuṇī* to revile a *bhikṣu*, antagonize him, [or] upbraid him. Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the sixth *gurudharma* for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.85

## I.3.4.7 Seventh Gurudharma

"Ānanda, if a *bhikṣuṇī* violates86 a *gurudharma*, she should show respect87 to both *saṃgha*s for half a month. Accordingly, Ānanda, I have established the seventh *gurudharma*88 for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.89

## I.3.4.8 Eighth Gurudharma

"Ānanda, a *bhikṣuṇī* who has been fully ordained for a hundred years 90 should salute91 to a *bhikṣu* who has been fully ordained that very day, praise him, stand up, place her palms together, and show him respect.92 Ānanda, accordingly, I have established the eighth *gurudharma* for women, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.93

## I.3.5 The Eight Gurudharmas As Means Of Ordination

"Ānanda, if Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepts94 and keeps these eight *gurudharma*s assiduously, in that case, that itself will be her going-forth 
(*pravrajyā*), that itself will be her full ordination (upasaṃpadā), that itself will be her bhikṣuṇīhood." Thus he spoke.95

## I.3.6 Ānanda'S Report Of Admission Conditions To Mahāprajāpatī I.3.6.1 Ānanda'S Encounter With Mahāprajāpatī

Then the Venerable Ānanda was delighted and rejoiced in what the Buddha had said. Rejoicing, he bowed with his head at the feet of the Bhagavān and departed from his presence. He went to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, and said to Mahāprajāpatī:

## I.3.6.2 Communicating Of The Consent Of The Buddha

"Gautamī, permission has been granted for women to go forth and obtain full ordination, and bhikṣuṇīhood in the well-proclaimed Dharmavinaya. Nevertheless, the Bhagavān has established eight *gurudharma*s in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe them for life. They should be applied assidiuously."
[Gautamī replied:] "I will listen to what the Venerable Ānanda says. Please speak."
96

## I.3.7 Ānanda'S Repetition Of The Eight Gurudharmas I.3.7.1 First Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān said the following: 'Ānanda, after women have received the going forth and the higher ordination from *bhikṣu*s, they should understand well that they [attained] bhikṣuṇī*hood*.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this first *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.2 Second Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, *bhikṣuṇī*s should seek the teacher's instruction from the *bhikṣu*s every half month.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this second *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life.

97

## I.3.7.3 Third Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, *bhikṣuṇī*s should not enter the rainy-season retreat in a residence where there are no bhikṣus.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this third *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.4 Fourth Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, when *bhikṣuṇī*s are concluding their stay in the rainy-season retreat, they should perform the pravāraṇā in both *saṃgha*s, with regard to three points: 98 what they have seen, heard, or suspected.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this fourth *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.5 Fifth Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, when a *bhikṣu* has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle, a *bhikṣuṇī* should not reproach him or remind him [of that]. Bhikṣuṇīs are not permitted to reproach or remind a *bhikṣu* who has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle. However, it is not prohibited for *bhikṣu*s to reproach or remind *bhikṣuṇī*s, who have failings in their discipline, failings in their view, failings in their behavior, or failings in their lifestyle.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], 
the Bhagavān has established this fifth *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.6 Sixth Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, a *bhikṣu*ṇī should not revile a *bhikṣu*. She should not antagonize him. She should not upbraid him. It is not permitted for *bhikṣu*ṇīs to revile, antagonize, or upbraid a *bhikṣu*. Ānanda, I do not permit a *bhikṣuṇī* to revile a *bhikṣu*, antagonize him, [or] upbraid him.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this sixth gurudharma. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.7 Seventh Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, if a *bhikṣuṇī* violates a *gurudharma*, she should show respect to both *saṃgha*s for half a month.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bhagavān has established this seventh gurudharma. Women should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.8 Eighth Gurudharma

"Gautamī, the Bhagavān further said the following: 'Ānanda, a *bhikṣuṇī* who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should salute a *bhikṣu* who has been fully ordained that very day, praise him, stand up, place her palms together, and show him respect.' Gautamī, in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], the Bha99gavān has established this eighth *gurudharma*. Women should observe it for life. "The Bhagavān further said: 'Ānanda, if Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepts and keeps these eight *gurudharma*s assiduously, in that case, that itself will be her going-forth (*pravrajyā*), that itself will be her full ordination (upasaṃpadā that itself will be her bhikṣuṇīhood.' Thus he spoke."

## I.3.8 Mahāprajāpatī'S Acquiescence I.3.8.1 Joyful Acceptance Of The Eight Gurudharmas

[Thereupon Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī replied:] "Venerable Ānanda, the Bhagavān has established these eight *gurudharma*s in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe them for life. I accept them with my speech, with my mind, and even with the crown of my head."
100

## I.3.8.2 Metaphor Of A Flower Garland

"It is as follows: Ānanda: Any girl (*kanyā*)
101 from the royal caste (*kṣatriya*), 
a brahmin girl, a girl from the merchant caste (*vaiśa*), or a girl from the commoners' caste (*śūdra*), when she has thoroughly washed, fully anointed, cut her hair and nails, put on white clothes, and if she is given an *utpala* flower garland by someone, a garland [made of the] flowers of the *campaka* tree, a *pāriśaka* garland, or a lemon-tree flower (*atimukta*) garland,102 she would take it with both hands, well-pleased and delighted, and put it on the highest limb of her body, the head. Venerable Ānanda, likewise with regard to these eight *gurudharma*s established by the Bhagavān in order to contain women's faults and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds], which should be observed by women for their whole life, I accept them with my speech, with my mind, and even with the crown of my head."
103

## I.4 The Buddha'S Consent To Mahāprajāpatī'S Higher Ordination

Since Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepted the *gurudharma*s, the Bhagavān gave her permission104 to go forth and become a fully ordained *bhikṣuṇī*.

105 103 For the shorter Pāli parallel, see Vin II 255–256, Cv X.1.5, Horner (1938‒1966: 
v.355).

104 Cf. subtitle of this passage in the Pāli Vinaya: *bhikkhunīupasampadānujānanaṃ*, 
i. e., permission for *bhikkhunī* ordination. 

105 Unlike the Tibetan, the Chinese MSV adds: "When Mahāprajāpatī accepted the principles to be respected, then she and the five hundred Śākyan women went forth, received the higher ordination, and became nuns" (Anālayo 2016: 216). It is not possible to ascertain whether the Sanskrit makes mention of the remaining five hundred aspirants to ordination here, because the Sanskrit manuscript is missing an entire folio (folio 8), and only resumes in section II.i.1.3, which appears in the present publication in Chapter 3. The missing folio can be expected to have contained the end of Ānanda's report to Mahāprajāpatī (end of the eighth gurudharma I.3.7.8), Mahāprajāpatī's acquiescence (I.3.8), her joyful acceptance of the eight *gurudharma*s (I.4), as well as the beginning of the Manual for Bhikṣuṇī Ordination. After 1.2.1 of the present Chapter, from the moment when they had arrived at the village in Nādikā after following the Buddha there, up to this point, no further mention is made in the Sanskrit, Tibetan, or Chinese of the other women seeking ordination along with Mahāprajāpatī. Thus, at this point, according to the Tibetan version, the foundation of the nuns' order has yet to take place. 

In the Tibetan, the text then abruptly switches interlocutors, with Upāli replacing Ānanda, a shift attested in both the Chinese and Tibetan MSV, with the Sanskrit text there missing, but not attested in the Pāli Vinaya. In this new section, Upāli repeats the previous comment of the Buddha regarding Mahāprajāpatī's ordination by accepting the *gurudharma*s, and asks about the 500 women accompanying her. Ānanda is no longer mentioned from this point onward in the Tibetan. 

The Pāli parallel, Vin II 256, differs here in that Ānanda reports back to the Buddha that Mahāpajāpatī has accepted the eight *garudhamma*s (Horner 1938‒ 1966: v.355). As mentioned above (I.3.2.2), unlike the MSV, in the Pāli Vin II 256, Cv X.1.6, at this point the Buddha comments that if "women had not obtained going forth from the home into homelessness in the *dhamma* and discipline" the dhamma would have endured for a thousand years, but now will only last for five hundred years, and then only do we find in the Pāli Vinaya a parallel to the four similes, above at 1.3.2.3.1–3, and 1.3.3.3.

## 3 Manual For Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

Whereas the Manual for Bhikṣu Ordination (Bhikṣūpasaṃpadā*jñapti*) 
appears in the very first chapter in the Tibetan Vinaya, the Pravraj*yāvastu*
(Rab tu 'byung ba'i *gzhi*),1the Manual for Bhikṣuṇī Ordination (*Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*) is to be found some ten volumes later in the Tibetan canon, in one of the last volumes of the vinaya, in the section on 'minor matters' or Kṣudrakavastu (*Phran tshegs kyi gzhi*). According to Clarke 
(2015: 63), the "Kṣudra*kavastu* (Chapter on Miscellanea) contains material that is found in multiple sections in other Vinayas including the following four (Pali titles): *Vattakkhandhaka* (Chapter on Deportment); Bhikkhunī*kkhandhaka* (Chapter on Nuns); *Pañcasatikakkhandhaka* (Chapter on the First Council of 500 Arhats); and *Sattasatikakkhandhaka* (Chapter on the Second Council of 700 Arhats)." This text is only extant in Tibetan and Chinese translation and it is considered to be particularly important for the studies of *bhikṣuṇī*s in India.

2 The *Manual for Bhikṣuṇī Ordination*, edited and translated in this chapter, corresponds to the respective passages partly preserved in the Sanskrit fragments, ms. c.25(R) of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, on folio pages 9 forward. This comprises the second part of the so-called Bhikṣuṇīkarma*vācanā*, as described above in the Introduction.

3 Details on these primary sources can be found in the Introduction above at 1.2.2. Information as to the Tibetan text edition are also provided in the Introduction, at 1.2.3.

## 3.1 The Main Parts Of The Manual For Bhikṣuṇī Ordination In The Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya

The Mūlasarvāstivāda *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*4contains all stages of a woman's ordination up to full ordination. For ease of navigation, a brief outline of the main parts of the ritual for conferring such ordination is provided here.

## Ii.I–Ii.Ii

The provision for going forth (Tib. *rab tu 'byung ba*, Skt. *pravrajyā*), which starts with going to the triple refuge (Tib. *skyabs gsum du 'gro ba*, Skt. *trīṇ*i śaraṇa*gamanāni*) and acceptance of the five precepts of a lay woman (Tib. dge bsnyen ma'i bslab pa'i gzhi lnga, Skt. *pañca upāsikāśikṣāpadāni*)

## Ii.Iii

The provision for *śrāmaṇerikā* precepts (Tib. dge tshul ma'i bslab pa'*i gzhi*, 
Skt. śrāmaṇeri*kāśikṣāpadāni*)

## Ii.Iv

The provision for a probationer (Tib. *dge slob ma*, Skt. *śikṣamāṇā*, Mvy 8721),
5i.e., provision for the the six precepts and the six subordinate precepts 
(Tib. chos drug 6dang rjes su 'brang ba'i chos drug 7*gi bslab pa*, Skt. 

ṣaḍdharmāḥ ṣaḍanudharmāḥ *śikṣāḥ*)
8

## Iii

The provision for full ordination (Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa*, Skt. upasaṃpadā)

## Iii.I

Granting of consent by the *bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha* to the *śikṣamāṇā* to practice as a celibate, i.e., to proceed for full ordination (Tib. tshangs par spyod pa la rim gror bya ba'i sdom pa, Skt. brahmacaryopasthāna*saṃvṛti*)
9

## Iii.Ii

Full ordination by both kinds of saṃgha (Tib. *dge 'dun sde gnyis ka las* bsnyen par rdzogs pa, Skt. ubhayasa*ṃghād upasaṃpadā*)
It bears mention that the actual full ordination of a bhik*ṣuṇī* is performed by both *saṃgha*s, i.e., by a *saṃgha* of at least ten *bhikṣu*s and a saṃgha of at least twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs by means of a legal act (Tib. las, Skt. *karman*) consisting of one motion (Tib. *gsol ba*, Skt. *jñapti*), a proclamation (Tib. 

brjod pa, Skt. *anuśrāv*aṇā)
10 put three times, and the result formulated as a resolution. This is called a [legal] act with the decision as the fourth [after]
the motion (Tib. *gsol ba dang bzhi'i las*, Skt. *jñapticaturthakarman*).11

## Iii.Iii

This means that although all the first stages of ordination are carried out by bhik*ṣuṇī*s alone, the actual full ordination requires the presence of a *saṃgha* of ten *bhikṣu*s. Although mention is made of a female preceptor or upādhyāyikā (Tib. *mkhan mo*), she does not play an active role after the bhikṣ*u saṃgha* has joined the saṃ*gha* of twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs. However, no mention is made of a bhik*ṣu upādhyāya*. After the *bhik*ṣus have joined the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha, 12 the female presiding offical (Skt. *karmakārikā bhikṣuṇī*;
Tib. *las byed pa'i dge slong ma*), no longer guides the candidate through the rites nor is it her task to declare the *karmavācanā*s. Instead, it is a male
 
presiding official (Skt. karmakāraka*-bhik*ṣu; Tib. *las byed pa'i dge slong* pha) who performs this function.

13 At the end of the act of full ordination, i.e., after measuring the shade, ascertaining the season and the time of the day or night, the male ritual master announces the four kinds of guidelines14 that the newly ordained *bhikṣu*ṇīs must observe thereafter. These are:
13 See Guṇaprabha in his auto-commentary to the *Vinayasūtra* D 4119 ('dul ba), zhu, 48a1–7. In the English translation from the Sanskrit, Jyväsjärvi quotes first Guṇaprabha's *Vinayasūtra* to state: "In [the section on] full ordination, in the requesting for that etc., ['a nun' is understood] for those other than the presiding officer." She translates his commentary to that passage as follows: "In the requesting for full ordination etc., a nun [is understood] in place of any monk other than the presiding officer (*karmakartṛ*). Beginning with requesting for full ordination, the presiding officer can only be a monk, not a nun ‒ this is stated. Earlier, a nun [can act] as the female presiding officer in requesting for full ordination: in the midst of the order of the nuns alone, it is she who grants the permission regarding the foundation of celibacy." Returning to the *Vinayasūtra*, 
her translation reads, "In this context, the assembled community." This is followed by his auto-commentary, as follows, "Here, in the requesting for full ordination etc., the entire community of the monks is to be understood [to be present]. It means that motions such as the petition are to be carried out when both communities [of monks and nuns] have assembled." (Jyväsjärvi 2011: 514). For the Tibetan parallel, see D 4119 ('dul ba), zhu, 48a4–7: *bsnyen par rdzogs pa la* ni de gsol pa la sogs pa'i las byed pa las gzhan pa'i'o zhes bya ba ni bsnyen par rdzogs pa la dge slong thams cad kyi gnas su dge slong ma blta bar bya ba ma yin te/ 'on kyang bsnyen par rdzogs pa la ni de gsol ba la sogs pa'i las byed pa po las gzhan pa'i dge slong gi gnas su dge slong ma'i bsnyen par rdzogs par gsol ba nas brtsams te 'dir las byed pa po'i dge slong nyid de dge slong ma ni ma yin zhes bya ba ni brjod par 'gyur ro/ / bsnyen par rdzogs pa gsol ba las snga *rol du dge slong* ma las byed pa po ste gang zhig 'dir dge slong ma'i dge 'dun 'ga' zhig gi dbus su tshangs par spyod pa la nye bar gnas pa'i sdom pa sbyin pa zhes bya ba'i don to/ / 'dir dge 'dun gyis bsnan par bya'o zhes bya ba ni bsnyen par rdzogs par g*sol ba* la sogs pa la dge slong gi dge 'dun slob dpon du gyur pa rtogs par bya'o/ / gnyis ka'i dge 'dun tshogs la gsol ba nas brtsams te las byed pa po ni *dang po zhes bya* ba'i don to.

14 The Theravāda tradition seems to have only the first two of these four kinds of guidelines. See, for example, the manual for higher ordination provided by the Samasata Lanka Sasanaloka Bhikkhuni Association (2002: 7–10).

1. The Three Supports of Life (Tib. *gnas gsum*, Skt. t*rayo niśrayāḥ*).

2. The Eight Infractions Leading to Exclusion from the Saṃgha (Tib. 

phas pham pa brgyad, Skt. a*ṣṭau patanīyā dharmāḥ* respectively **aṣṭau pārājikā dharmāḥ*, cf. Mvy 8358).

3. The Eight Principles to be Observed for Life (Tib. b*la ma'i chos* brgyad, Skt. a*ṣṭau gurudharmāḥ*).

4. The Four Qualities that make a Recluse (Tib. *dge sbyong du byed* pa'i *chos bzhi*, Skt. catvāraḥ śramaṇakāraka*–dharmāḥ*).

15 Finally, it follows a concluding instruction.

into the Bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha II.i.1 Upāli's Question on the Procedure **for the Admission of** Other Women

## Ii.I.1.1 Upāli'S Question

Venerable Upāli1asked the Buddha, the Bhagavān: "Venerable, [you,] the Bhagavān, said, 'If Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepts and keeps the eight *gurudharma*s assiduously, in this case, that itself will be her going-forth
(*pravrajyā*), that itself will be her full ordination (upasa*ṃpadā*), [and] that itself will be her bhikṣuṇīhood.' However, Venerable, how do other women go forth, become fully ordained, [and] obtain bhikṣuṇīhood?"
2

## Ii.I.1.2 The Buddha'S Reply

The Bhagavān said, "Upāli, other women should receive going forth and be fully ordained in stages."
3

## Ii.I.1.3 The Buddha On The Bhikṣus' Question On The Procedure For The Admission Of Other Women

When the Bhagavān said, 'Other women should receive going forth and be fully ordained in stages,' the *bhik*ṣus did not know how to proceed in stages.

4 When the *bhik*ṣus asked the Bhagavān about this, the Bhagavān replied:

## Ii.I.2 Differentiation Between The Early And The Later Procedure Of Full Ordination

"Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī5and the five hundred Śākya women6 went forth and then were fully ordained and attained bhikṣuṇīhood by accepting the gurudharmas. Other women should proceed in stages."
7

## Ii.Ii Introductory Steps, Refuge And Upāsikā Precepts

II.ii.1 Introductory Steps **for the Acceptance of a Woman into the** Bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha

## Ii.Ii.1.1 Whom And How To Approach

[A woman] who wishes to go forth8should approach any *bhikṣu*ṇī. That
[*bhikṣu*ṇī] should interrogate her regarding obstructive conditions [for ordination]9and accept her. Having accepted her, she should give her the triple refuge10 and the five precepts (*śikṣāpada*)
11 of a lay woman.

12 What are the three refuges? Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha.13

## Ii.Ii.1.2 List Of The Five Upāsikā Precepts

What are the five precepts? Fully refraining from killing living beings, 14 and fully refraining from stealing, 15 engaging in sexual misconduct, 16 lying, 17

## Ii.Ii.2 Taking Threefold Refuge And Acceptance As Upāsikā Ii.Ii.2.1 Beginning Of The Actual Rite

Therefore, refuge and the precepts should be given.21 [Skt. After she has made three circumbulations,] first let her bow to the Teacher, 22 [i.e., the Buddha]. Next, let her bow to the *bhikṣu*ṇī who will give her refuge and the precepts, and let her join the palms of her hands in reverence. Then she should say the following:

## Ii.Ii.2.2 Taking Threefold Refuge And Request For Acceptance As Upāsikā

'Noble One, 23 may I please24 have your attention. [Skt. From today onward,] 
for as long as I live, 25 I, by the name of so-and-so take refuge in the Buddha, 
[Skt. the Bhagavān], the foremost26 among human beings.

27 I take refuge in the holy Dharma, 28 the supreme among [those teachings] freeing from desire. 

I take refuge in the Saṃgha, the supreme among the many [communities].29 I request the Noble One to accept30 me as an *upāsikā* for as long as I live.'
This should be [repeated] a second and third time. Then the *ācāryikā*31 says, 
'This is the method,' and the *upāsikā* replies, 'It is excellent.'

## Ii.Ii.3 Bestowing The Five Upāsikā Precepts Ii.Ii.3.1 First Precept

Then give the five precepts. [The candidate should say], 'Noble One, may I please have your attention. Just as the noble *arhat*s 32 refrained, fully refrained, from killing living beings for as long as they lived, so too, from today onward for as long as I live, will I, by the name of so-and-so refrain, fully refrain from killing living beings. And by means of this first precept, 33 just as the arhats trained, so too will I train, practice, and act accordingly.

## Ii.Ii.3.2 Further Precepts And Completion Of The Rite

'Furthermore, just as for as long as they lived the [Skt. noble] *arhat*s, have refrained, fully refrained, from stealing, engaging in sexual misconduct out of desire, lying and intoxication from beer, wine, or liquor, which is a state of carelessness, so too will I, by the name of so-and-so refrain from stealing engaging in sexual misconduct out of desire, lying and intoxication from beer, wine, or liquor, which is a state of carelessness, from today onward for as long as I live. I will turn away from intoxication from beer, wine, or liquor, which is a state of carelessness. 'I too will train according to these five precepts by which the *arhat*s trained.'
This should be [repeated] for a second and third time.

Then the *ācāryikā* says, 'This is the method,' and the *upāsikā* replies, 'It is excellent.'
34 II.iii Going Forth (Pravrajyā) and Acceptance as **Śrāmaṇerikā**

## Ii.Iii.1 Preparation Ii.Iii.1.1 Appointment Of The Announcer Bhikṣuṇī

After that, appoint35 an announcer (*ārocikā) *bhikṣu*ṇī 36 from among the saṃgha. The one who was appointed should ask the *bhikṣu*ṇī [who admitted the candidate],
37'Did you interrogate her on the obstructive conditions?' If
 
she makes the announcement without having asked [this], she will be guilty of a transgression.

38

## Ii.Iii.1.2 Announcement (*Ārocana)

After that, the [*ārocikā] *bhikṣu*ṇī should summon the *saṃgha*,
39 or it would also be appropriate to announce the following in their individual quarters:
40
'Noble female saṃgha members, please listen. This [person] by the name of so-and-so seeks to go forth under the female preceptor (*upādhyāyikā*)
41 so-
 
and-so. This female householder, 42 [dressed in] white 43 with her hair unshaven, requests to go forth in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, receive full ordination, and bhikṣuṇīhood. This [person] by the name of so-and-so, after having shaved her hair and donned the saffron-colored robes, 44 out of right45 faith wants to go forth from home to homelessness 46 under the female preceptor47 so-and-so.48 Should she [be allowed to] go forth?'

## Ii.Iii.1.3 Assent By The Saṃgha

All should say, 'Yes, if she is pure.' If they say this, that is good. But if [they do] not, they will be guilty of a transgression.

## Ii.Iii.1.4 Request For A Female Preceptor

After that, she should ask for a female preceptor.

49 [Skt. She should ask again in this way. After paying homage, squatting in front of her and placing her palms together, she should say:] 'Noble Teacher (*ācāryikā*),
50 may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so request the *ācāryikā* to be the female preceptor. Ācāryikā, please become my female preceptor. I request going forth (*pravrajyā*) from the *ācāryikā* as female preceptor. Recite this a second and a third time. [When repeating] the words for the third time, the female preceptor should be addressed as female preceptor (Tib. mkhan mo, Skt. **upādhyāyikā*) [instead of *ācāryikā*]. 51 The female preceptor says, 'This is the method,' and the one who has gone forth (*pravrajitā*)
52 replies, 'It is excellent'.

53

## Ii.Iii.1.5 The Tonsure

Then the female preceptor should ask the haircutting *bhikṣu*ṇī to cut the hair. 

That [bhik*ṣuṇī*] for her part should ask, 'Younger sister, 54 may I cut your hair?' If she says, 'I want to have it cut', cut it. If on the other hand, she says, 
'No,' the [haircutting *bhikṣu*ṇī] should say: 'Please leave.'

## Ii.Iii.1.6 Taking A Bath

"Bhikṣus, 55 I have instructed56 that the haircutting bhik*ṣuṇī* [proceed] in accordance with the necessary activities.

57 The haircutting *bhikṣu*ṇī should bathe her with warm water, if it is cold [weather]. But if it is hot, she should bathe her with cool water."
58

## Ii.Iii.1.7 Confirming Sex And Providing With Robes And Alms Bowl59

"Then, just at the moment when the water on her body has dried, the undergarment60 should be put on. When putting on the undergarment, the 55 The Tib. instrumental does not correspond to the Skt. vocative plural. The first person singular pronoun and verb form make it clear that in this passage the Buddha is addressing the monks, presumably together with Upāli, on what he has laid down as to how the ordination of women should be conducted. The English translation here follows the Skt.

56 The Tibetan text does not here provide a clear indication where the quote closes, therefore it might be argued that the quote continues into the next section and concludes with the words "conjoined genitals". Sanskrit here employs the present tense, first person singular, as would be expected since the Buddha is replying to a request from Upāli on procedural instructions for ordaining women. 

But the Tibetan employs the past tense. Skt. *aham ... prajñāpayāmi* (I instruct); 
Tib. *bdag gis ... bcas te*. Jä: *bcas pa* - originally pf. of *'cha' ba*, little used.

57 Tib. *mngon du spyad pa'i chos*, Skt. *āsamudācārikān dharmān*. BHSD: 
āsamudācārika adj., with dharma, (rule) applying to customary behavior. Lokesh Chandra 2007: āsamudācārika - kun tu spyod pa; *āsamudācārikān dharmān –*
kun tu spyod pa'i chos dag.

58 At this point the Skt. has the following sentence, which appears in the Tibetan at the end of II.iii.1.7: "If the haircutting *bhikṣu*ṇī does not perform the necessary activities as they have been laid down, she will be guilty of a transgression." 
59 Although the ordination ritual for men includes this step of being bathed prior to being given robes, with warm water in cold weather and cool water in warm weather, there is no examination of genitals. See Uj II.ii.1.8.

60 Tib. *sham thabs*, Skt. *nivāsana*. Mvy 8938 sham thabs (*nivāsana*). One of the thirteen requisites of life for *bhikṣu*s (*'tsho ba'i yo byad bcu gsum*; Mvy 8932 yo byad bu gsum). *Nivāsana* refers to the "inner" or lower robe, acc. to Edgerton an 
"undergarment". Acc. to Härtel (1956: 69 note 2) in northern regions the antar-*vāsa* (Tib. *mthang gos*), which reaches from the navel down to the knees, was also referred to as niv*āsana*. In contemporary Tibetan monasteries, misleadingly, the *antarvāsa* is commonly referered to as *sham thabs*, while in the Vinaya characteristics indicating female sex should be examined61 by asking: 'Do you lack genitals?62 Do you have both [male and female] genitals?

63 Do you have conjoined genitals?'
64
[Skt. They were embarrassed when they were examined naked. The Bhagavān said, "They should not be examined naked. They should be examined instead while they are dressing, without their knowledge."
context it is known as *mthang gos*. Beneath the *antarvāsa* (also when sleeping and taking a shower) an undergarment is worn. This undergarment reaches from the navel down to the knees, while the *antarvāsa* reaches to the ankle. The undergarment is commonly known as *smad g.yogs* (also: *smad gos*). The Mvy list of the *yo byad bu gsum* (8932) distinguishes between 8935 antarvāsa (*mthang* gos), which is one of the three robes of a *bhik*ṣu, respectively one of the five robes of a *bhikṣu*ṇī (see below III.i.1.1.3), and 8938 nivāsana (*sham thabs*). 

Therefore, here *sham thabs* clearly refers to an undergarment, most likely to what today is the *smad g.yogs*, and not to the *antarvāsa* as perhaps wrongly assumed by Härtel.

61 Cf. the Chin. *Ekottarakarmaśataka* parallel in Wei-Chun (2006: 21–22): "(The bhikṣuṇī) has to inspect whether (the applicant) is without the female organ, or with both (male and female) organs, or with deformed organ. ... While putting on the lower robe for (the applicant), (the *bhikṣu*ṇī) can look it over secretly, without letting the applicant be aware of it" (T. 1453[24] 460ab).

62 Tib. *mtshan ma med pa*, Skt. *avyañjanā*. Different, probably wrong spelling below in Sch 253.16 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 16 a5 (see III.i.1.3.2): avya*ṃñjanā*.

63 Tib. *mtshan gnyis pa*, Skt. *ubhayavyañjanā*. Biol., med.: hermaphrodite, i.e., 
having the marks of both sexes.

64 Tib. *gle 'dams pa*, Skt. *sambhinnavyañjanā*. Cf. Mvy 8927 in a list of terms from the Pravrajyāvastu: gle 'dams pa, sle gdams pa (sa*ṃbhinnavyañjanā*); Mvy 9514 in a list of diseases: gle 'thams pa, gle gdams pa (saṃ*bhinnavyañjanam*). Cf. DM sle 'dams pa - O.T. = *mtshan ma chad pa*. Blan 304.6–305. Tib. *gle 'dams pa* acc. to ZHD sm. to *sle 'dams pa ‒ mtshan ma chad pa'i skyes pa* (a man with the sex organ cut off). For women see also ZHD sle 'dam can ‒ mtshan ma dang bshang lam 'dres pa'i nad na mkhan bud med (a woman diseased with anus and vagina joined). Similarly, the *Lung phran tshegs kyi rnam par bshad pa* D 4115, p. 149b explains: 'bud med kyi mtshan dang bshang ba'i lam dang bcas pa gcig tu gyur pa gang la yod pa de ni 'dir gle 'dams pa yin no." For the three sexual anomalies, see also Gyatso (2003 notes 11, 70). For the related story from the Kṣ*udrakavastu*, see Cabezón: "The woman with conjoined organs 
(saṃbhinnavyañjanā, *gle 'dams*), a woman whose anus and vagina are con-joined" (2017: 434–435).

Then, if they are pure, they should be given saffron robes (*kāṣāya vastra*)
65 by the female preceptor, and then given *pravrajyā* starting from going for refuge.]66 If the haircutting *bhikṣu*ṇī does not correctly implement the prescribed necessary activities, she will be guilty of a transgression.

67 II.iii.2 The Actual Process of Going Forth (Pravrajyā) and Acceptance as **Śrāmaṇerikā**

## Ii.Iii.2.1 Refuge And Intent To Become A Renunciate

Then 68 comes the actual process of going forth.

69 First have her make prostrations to the teacher, [that is, to the Buddha]. After that, have her prostrate to the female preceptor. 

Have her squat in front of [the female preceptor] with her palms together, and then say the following:70'Female preceptor, may I please have your attention. For as long as I live, I, by the name of so-and-so take refuge in the Buddha, [Skt. the Bhagavān], the foremost among human beings. I take refuge in the holy Dharma, the supreme among [those teachings] freeing from desire. I take refuge in the Saṃgha, the supreme among the many 
[communities]. The Bhagavān, 71 the Tathāgata, 72 the Arhat, 73 the Samyaksaṃbuddha74 Śākyamuni,75 the Śākya lion,76 the Principle King77 of the Śākyas78‒ following him, who has gone forth, I [too] will go forth, giving up the signs of a householder.

79 I take up the signs of a renunciate. [Skt. 

Having taken them up, I will keep them.] This should be repeated a second and third time. 

Then the female preceptor says, 'This is the method,' and the renunciate80 replies, 'It is excellent.'
81

## Ii.Iii.2.2 Appointment Of A Śrāmaṇerikā Preceptor And Request For Śrāmaṇerikā Ordination

The female preceptor should appoint a *bhikṣu*ṇī to bestow the *śrāmaṇerikā*82 precepts [Skt. That *bhikṣu*ṇī should ask her, 'Have you been asked about the obstructive conditions?'
83 If she accepts her without asking, she will be guilty of a transgression.]
Then the appointed [*bhikṣu*ṇī] has [the candidate] make prostrations to the teacher [i.e., the Buddha].

84[She then says,] 'Squat in front of [me].' Have her join her palms together, and give her refuge and *śrāmaṇerikā* precepts [as follows]: 
'Noble One, 85 may I please have your attention. For as long as I live, I, by the name of so-and-so take refuge in the Buddha, the foremost among human beings. I take refuge in the holy Dharma, the supreme among [those teachings] freeing from desire.86 I take refuge in the Saṃgha, the supreme among the many [communities]. For as long as I live may the noble one accept me as a *śrāmaṇerikā*.' This should be repeated a second and third time. [When repeating] the words for the third time, [the *bhikṣu*ṇī bestowing the precepts] should be addressed as '*ācāryikā*'. The *ācāryikā* says, 'This is the method,' and the *śrāmaṇerikā* replies, 'It is excellent.'
II.iii.2.3 Assessment of the Time of the Day and the Season of the Year Then a *bhikṣu*ṇī should measure the shadow. The 'person' (**puruṣa*),
87 the formula (**pada*),
88 the time of day, 89 and also the season should be announced.90 87 Tib. *skyes bu* (human being). Roach & Lindsey (2009: 65): dge 'dun pa dag thur ma ring po dag gis 'jal bar byed pa na/ de ltar yang ha cang thogs nas bcom ldan 
'das kyis bka' stal pa/ thur ma sor bzhi tsam gyis gzhal bar bya zhing thur ma ji tsam yod pa de tsam la skyes bu zhes brjod par bya'o// (Even then it took too long, so the Conqueror commanded them to make the measurement with a stick which was just four fingerwidths in length, and a stick which is just that specific length came to be called a "little person"). Cf. Wilson (1989) Part 5, Table 2 
(Measures of Length): Skt. aṅ*guli*, Tib. sor (mo), fingerwidth, 0.75 in, 19 mm. See also Takakusu (1896: 100–101): "(Note by I-tsing): Purusha is man; the reason why the shadow that measures four finger-breadths is called 'one man' (Eka-purusha) is that, when the shadow of the perpendicular stick which itself measures four finger-breadths is also four finger-breadths in length on the horizontal stick, a man's shadow falling on the ground is the same length as the real height of that man." 
88 Tib. *rtsa ba*. Measuring the shadow etc. comes also below, cf. section III.iii.1, but there is no mention of "*rtsa ba.*" EKŚ(D) 120 a4–5 does not help here either. 

It similarly just reads: *de'i 'og tu slob dpon ma yin pa dge slong ma gzhan gang* yang rung ba zhig gis grib tshod gzhal bar bya zhing, skyes bu dang, rtsa ba dang, nyin mtshan gyi cha dang, dus tshod kyang brjod par bya'o. Cf. Pāli Vin I 95.36, Mv I.77, Horner 1938‒1966: iv.123: "The shadow must be measured at once, the length of the season should be explained, the portion of the day should be explained, the formula should be explained" (*tāvad eva chāyā metabbā,* 
utupamāṇaṃ ācikkhitabba*ṃ, divasabhāgo ācikkhitabbo, saṃgīti ācikkhitabbā*). Horner (123 note 1) comments on the phrase "the shadow must be measured" that "[t]his must mean the shadow of the candidate, cast by the sun", and that it should be measured with the words, "It is the length of one man or two men, ekaporisā, *dveporisā*". On "the formula" Horner (124n1) notes "*sangīti*, chanting together". Thus "*rtsa ba*" may mean "*tshig rkang*" (Skt. *pada*), i.e., one line in the verse of a stanza, or a formula.

89 Each 24–hour daily cycle is divided into several portions. For details, see below III.iii.3 Ascertaining the Time of Day.

90 This passage 2.3 is not to be found in Härtel (1956: 71). In Sanskrit, as mentioned above, folios 12 through 14 are missing here (cf. Sch 251n123). The Tibetan text in Uj is similar to our text here but has no equivalent in Skt. and Chin. A (Chung 2011: 86): II.ii.2.3. For more details, see below III.iii.1–3.

## Ii.Iii.2.4 Bestowal Of The Ten Śrāmaṇerikā Precepts

Then give the ten precepts: 'Noble One, may I please have your attention. Just as the noble *arhat*s for as long as they lived gave up killing and refrained from [1] killing, so too will I, by the name of so-and-so, from today onward for as long as I live, give up killing and refrain from killing. And by means of this first precept, just as the *arhat*s trained, in this way I too will train, practice, and act accordingly. Furthermore, just as the noble *arhat*s for as long as they lived gave up [2] stealing, [3] unchaste behavior, 91 [4] lying and 
[5] intoxication from beer, wine or liquor, which is a state of carelessness, 
[6] singing, 92 dancing, 93 and beating [drums],
94 [7] [wearing] garlands, 95 perfume, 96 lotion, 97 and makeup, 98 [8] [using] high and large beds, 99 [9] 
eating at improper times, 100 and [10] accepting gold and silver, 101 and refrain from accepting gold and silver, so too will I, by the name of so-and-so, from today onward for as long as I live, give up [2] stealing, [3] unchaste behavior, [4] lying, and [5] intoxication from beer, wine or liquor, which is a state of carelessness, [6] singing, dancing, and beating [drums], [7] [wearing]
garlands, perfume, ointment, and makeup, [8] [using] high and large beds, 
[9] eating at improper times, and [10] accepting gold and silver, and refrain from accepting gold and silver. 

Thus will I, by means of these ten precepts according to which the arhats have trained, train, practice and act accordingly.' The ācāryikā should say, 'This is the method', and the *śrāmaṇerikā* should reply, 'It is excellent'.

## Ii.Iv The Process Of Acceptance As Śikṣamāṇā Ii.Iv.1 Preparation

When giving the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s 102, either to someone who has reached the age of ten years living in a household (Tib. *khyim na gnas pa*; Skt. gṛ*hoṣi*ṭā 103) or to an unmarried woman (Tib. *gzhon nu ma*; Skt. *kumārikā*)
104 who has reached the age of eighteen years,105 they should be given as follows: Convene a bhik*ṣuṇī* saṃgha and ask [its members] to sit down. Have the [*śrāmaṇerikā*] make prostrations to the gathered assembly106 of at least twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs, and tell her to squat in front of the senior107 bhik*ṣuṇī* and ask for a female preceptor. 

Have her make prostrations to the female preceptor and squat, placing her palms together.

out, Guṇaprabha also uses the term *kumārikā*, in his *Vinayasūtra* 53, and in addition cites '*kumārikābhūtā*" from the Bhik*ṣuṇīvibhaṅ*ga of the Mūlasarvāsti-vādin. Kieffer-Pülz notes that it is possible that *'kumārikā'* is a later development of kumāri*kābhūtā* (2005: 234 note 113).

105 Sch 253 18a3 gṛho*ṣitā dvādaśavarṣā* and kumārikā paripūrṇaviṃśativarṣā. 

Lamotte, vol. II (1944-1981/2001: 665) understands the twelve years of a gṛho*ṣitā* not as years of age, but as years of being married: "There are two kinds of *śikṣamāṇā*: i) those who take the six rules when they are young girls of eighteen years of age (*paripūrṇāṣṭadaśa kumārikā*); ii) those who take the six rules when they are women having ten years of married life (gṛhoṣitā daśavarśā)." Kieffer-Pülz (2005), discusses this question in detail and points out that although in general both translations are conceivable, in ancient India, during the period of the composition of the Vinaya, the common marriage age of girls was close to or after the onset of menstruation (2005: 214), i.e., at the age of ten to twelve. If a g*ṛhoṣitā* had to be married for twelve years first, before she could enter the biennial training as a *śikṣamāṇā*, it would require a minimum age of 22‒24 years (2005: 226).

106 Tib. *'khor*, Skt. pāriṣada. 

107 Tib. *rgan pa*, Skt. missing (gap in the ms). Mvy 2434 rgan pa (*jyeṣṭha*), i.e., 
senior/ longest-serving. SWTF *jyeṣṭha* mfn. vorzüglichste(r), obenan stehend, älteste(r).

II.iv.2 The Actual Process of Acceptance as **Śikṣamāṇā**
II.iv.2.1 Choosing a Female Preceptor (*upādhyāyikā*)

## Ii.Iv.2.1.1 Request For The Upādhyāyikā To Become The Female Preceptor

If [the person being addressed] is the female preceptor (*upādhyāyikā*),
108 [the candidate] should make a request of her as follows: 'Female Preceptor, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so request [you,] Female Preceptor, to be female preceptor. Female Preceptor, please be my female preceptor. I am requesting to receive109 the permission to train110 from you, Female Preceptor.'

## Ii.Iv.2.1.2 Request For An Ācāryikā To Become The Female Preceptor

In the event, that [the person being addressed] is an *ācāryikā*, [the candidate] should make the request as follows: 'Ācāryikā, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so request [you], Ācāryikā, to be female preceptor (*upādhyāyikā*). Ācāryikā, please become my female preceptor. I 
am requesting to assume the training precepts from [you], Ācāryikā, as female preceptor. [Repeat] this a second and third time. The third time, she should address her as 'female preceptor'. The female preceptor says, 'This is the method,' and the female disciple111 replies, 'It is excellent.'

## Ii.Iv.2.2 Request For Śikṣamāṇā Precepts By The Śrāmaṇerikā

Then the precepts for training should be requested: 'Members of the noble female *saṃgha*, please listen. I, by the name of so-and-so seek full ordination112 under [the one whose name] I utter for the purpose [of correctly identifying her, namely:]113 Female Preceptor so-and-so. I, by the name of so-and-so, under the female preceptor by the name of so-and-so, request of the noble female *saṃgha* two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s. Having reached the age of ten living in a household, or as an unmarried woman who has reached the age of eighteen, I request of the noble female *saṃgha* two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s. I request [the] compassionate, for the sake of compassion, to grant me [the precepts].' This should be done a second and third time.

## Ii.Iv.2.3 Authorization By A Bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha Ii.Iv.2.3.1 Motion For Bestowal Of Śikṣamāṇā Precepts By The Karmakārikā

After that, have one *bhikṣu*ṇī make the motion and institute the act:
114'Please listen. Noble female *saṃgha* members, 115 this [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-and-so has reached the age of ten years living in a household or the age of eighteen as an unmarried woman. She requests from the noble female saṃgha the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate dharmas, under the female preceptor named so-and-so. If the moment is right and the noble female *saṃgha* agrees to it, may the noble female saṃgha members grant [their] permission and may the noble female saṃgha members grant the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and six subordinate *dharma*s under the female preceptor named so-and-so, from the bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha to this [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-and-so, who has reached the age of ten years living in a household or the age of eighteen as an unmarried woman.' This is the motion.

## Ii.Iv.2.3.2 Proclamation By The Karmakārikā Of The Actual Act (Karmavācanā)

The [*saṃgha*] act (Tib. las, Skt. **karman*116) should be instituted as follows: 
'Please listen. Noble female *saṃgha* members, this [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-and-so, has reached the age of ten years living in a household or the age of eighteen as an unmarried woman. She requests from the noble female *saṃgha* the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s, under the female preceptor named so-and-so. For her sake, noble female *saṃgha*, since this [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-andso, who has reached the age of ten years living in a household or the age of eighteen as an unmarried woman, is requesting from the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s, under the female preceptor named so-and-so, those female *saṃgha* members who agree that this [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-and-so, who has reached the age of ten years living in a household or as an unmarried woman who has reached the age of eighteen, be granted the six *dharma*s and six subordinate dharmas by the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*, under the female preceptor named so-andso, do not say anything. Those who disagree, please speak.'

## Ii.Iv.2.3.3 Announcement Of The Final Resolution

'This [*śrāmaṇerikā*] by the name of so-and-so, who has reached the age of ten years living in a household or the age of eighteen as an unmarried woman has been given the training in the six *dharma*s and six subordinate *dharma*s by the noble female saṃgha members. The noble female *saṃgha* members have agreed and granted permission, by remaining silent.

117 Therefore, it is accepted accordingly.' Then the six *dharma*s and six subordinate *dharma*s are to be taught in detail.

## Ii.Iv.2.4 Teaching Of The Six Dharmas And Subordinate Dharmas Ii.Iv.2.4.1 The Six Dharmas 118

What are the six? [1] Not to go into a village119 alone. [2] Not to swim across a river.120 [3] Not to touch male persons. [4] Not to stay121 alone with a male, either. [5] Not to act as a go-between. [6] Not to conceal a censurable deed.

122 The Tathāgata has proclaimed these six *dharma*s in his discourses.

123

## Ii.Iv.2.4.2 The Six Subordinate Dharmas 124

What are the six subordinate *dharma*s? [1] Not to hold gold and the like. [2] Not to shave the hair on private parts. [3] Not to dig the soil, 125 and [4] not to cut green126 grass. [5] Not to eat food that was not offered and received. [6] 
Not to eat stored [food]. These six subordinate *dharma*s were not permitted by the Tathāgata.

122 Tib. *kha na ma tho mi bcab bo*, Skt. missing (gap in the ms.). Lit. censurable / 
blameworthy [action]. See also BHSD: *avadya*- confirmed by Tib. kha na ma mtho ba. Mvy 7237 kha na ma mtho ba *dang bcas* (pa) (*sāvadya*). In the case of a *bhikṣu*ṇī, this refers to the concealing of a *pārājika* offense committed by another *bhikṣu*ṇī, which has the consequence of expulsion from the order (see below IV.ii.2.7.1 Patanīya-Dharma, i.e., Tibetan BhīPrā *pārājika* no. 7, and Tsomo (1996: 82).

123 Tib. *gsung rab*, Skt. missing (gap in the ms.). Mvy 1433 gsung rab (*pravacana*).

124 Cf. VinSūV, p. 52: ṣaḍ anudharmāḥ katame | jātarūpaṃ na gṛhṇīyāt | na guhye roma śātayet | | na khanet pṛthivīṃ cāpi | na cchindyāt haritaṃ *tṛṇam | |* nāpratigrāhitaṃ svādet | svādet saṃnihitaṃ *na ca* | (English: What are the six anudharmas? She should not hold gold. She should not share the hair of her private parts, nor should she not dig in the earth. She should not cut green grass. 

She should not eat food that was not offered and she should not eat food that had been stored. From the *'Phags pa thams cad yod par smra ba'i rtza ba'i dge slong* ma'i so sor thar pa'i mdo'i 'grel pa (*Āryasarvāstivādimūlabhikṣuṇīprātimokṣasūtravṛtti*), D 4112, Tanjur (*'dul ba*), tsu, 133b4–5: *rjes su mthun pa'i chos drug* ni gser dngul la reg par mi bya ba dang, gsang ba'i spu mi breg pa dang, sa mi brko ba dang, rtswa sngon mo mi gcad pa dang, byin len [read: mi?] *bya ba dang,* sp*angs pa'i kha zas mi bza' ba'o*.

125 Cf. Tibetan BhīPrā *pātayantika* offense no. 56 (Tsomo 1996: 106).

126 The Tibetan term is rendered in several different ways (glen pas, sen mos, sems mo) in the various editions, likely reflecting the difficulty in construing the Sanskrit. Nevertheless, it has no counterpart in either the *Vinayasūtra* or the Bhikṣuṇīprātimokṣasūtravṛtti, both of which indicate that the reference is to green grass (Skt. haritaṃ *tṛṇam*, Tib. *rtswa sngon mo*).

III Full Ordination (Upasa**ṃpadā)**
III.i The Process of Granting the Consent to Practice as a Celibate 
(brahmacaryopasthāna*samv*ṛti)

## Iii.I.1 Preparation

III.i.1.1 Outfitting the Candidate (Upasaṃpatprekṣiṇī)
127 and Appointment of a Private Instructor (Raho'nuśāsikā) and Presiding Official (**Karmakārikā**)

## Iii.I.1.1.1 General Remarks

When [the *śikṣamāṇā*] has trained for two years in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s, she should be given the *brahmacaryopasthāna*saṃvṛti.*128 First the female preceptor should prepare the five robes and the alms bowl and appoint a private instructor129 and a presiding official.

130 pa bar ma'i tshul khrims so (a vow given before the actual *bhikṣu*ṇī vow is taken; an intermediate discipline, which is considered to be of the same kind of substance as the *śikṣamāṇā* vow). In the Pāli Vinaya this term does not occur. Instead "one who has been ordained on one side" (*ekatoupasampannā*) is mentioned. This term is introduced after women to be fully ordained were ashamed when *bhikkhu*s questioned them about twenty-four things (*catuvīsati* antarāyike dhamme) which are fully listed at that time (see Pāli Vin II Cv 271.21‒30, Cv X.17, cf. Horner 1938‒1966: v.375). The Buddha said: "I allow, bhikkhus, ordination in the *bhikkhusaṃgha* after she has been ordained on one side (*ekatoupasampannā*) and having cleared herself (in regard to the hindrances) in the bhikkhunīsaṃgha ("anujānāmi, bhikkhave ekatoupasam-pannāya bhikkhunīsaṃghe visuddhāya bhik*khusaṃghe upasampadan* ti" Pāli Vin II 271.34‒35, Cv X.17, cf. Horner 1938‒1966: v.375). On another occasion, the bhikkhunīs had not been instructed how to do this, and the Buddha ruled: "I allow them, *bhikkhus*, having been instructed first, afterwards to ask the things which are hindrances." ("anujānāmi bhikkhave paṭhamaṃ *anusāsitvā pacchā* antarāyike dhamme pucchitum." Pāli Vin II 272.2‒4, Cv X.17, cf. Horner 1938‒
1966: v.375). In yet another incident, the *bhikkhunīs* had been asking the candidates in the midst of the saṃgha, and then the Buddha said: "I allow them, bhikkhus, having them instructed aside, to ask the things which are hindrances in the midst of the saṃgha." ("anujānāmi bhikkhave ekamantaṃ *anusāsitvā* saṃghamajjhe antarā*yike dhamme pucchitu*ṃ" Pāli Vin II 272.6‒8, Cv X.17, cf. 

Horner 1938‒1966: v.376). In any case, brahmacaryopasthā*nasaṃv*ṛti is not equivalent to ordination in the order of the nuns.

129 Tib. *gsang ba ston pa*; Skt. missing (gap in the ms). But the term occurs again further down: III.i.1.2.3 *raho'nuśāsikā* (15b3) - female private instructor. This refers to the interviewer who inquires whether the candidate fulfills all the conditions for full ordination. Some of the questions are very intimate as we will see below. Cf. Mvy 8730 gsang ste ston pa (*raho'nuśāsaka*). Likewise, Negi. BHSD *raho'nuśāsaka*, f. °ikā - instructor in private. Cf. III.i.1.2.1, Sch 252 note 136 and MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 15b1 rahasy*anuśāsikā* (BHSD derivation from rahasya - adj. secret; n. secret (doctrine) + *anuśāsana* n. instruction? = *rahasya* anuśāsikā). The word would be more likely analyzed as follows: rahasi (*rahas*, 
locative singular and ind. "privately, in secret") + *anuśāsikā* (cf. Schmidt's note 136). If the first half was *rahasya*, the compound would be *rahasyānuśāsikā*.

130 Tib. *las byed pa'i dge slong ma* Skt. missing (gap in the ms). But the term occurs again further down. Cf. III.i.1.2.1, Sch 252 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 15b3 karmma-*kārikayā*. Cf. Mvy 3832, 8729 las byed pa (karmakara, karma*kāraka*). BHSD: 
"*karmakāraka*, m., or °ikā, f., the presiding officer at an assembly of monks or nuns before which a *jñapti*, q.v., is presented; he or she presents the *jñāpti*, and the following karma*vācanā*." Negi: las byed pa - karmakāraka; *las byed pa mo*
- *karmakārikā*. In the contemporary tradition, this is also known as las kyi slob dpon ma (**karmācāryikā*), but Negi gives neither a reference for las kyi slob dpon 

## Iii.I.1.1.2 Choosing A Female Preceptor (Upādhyāyikā) Iii.I.1.1.2.1 Gathering Of The Bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha

After that, the members of the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha assemble and take their seats. 

[The *śikṣamāṇā*] then makes three prostrations to a gathered community of at least twelve bhikṣuṇīs, and then she should request the following of the female preceptor:

## Iii.I.1.1.2.2 Request By The Śikṣamāṇā For A Female Preceptor

If [the *bhikṣu*ṇī addressed] is the female preceptor 131 (*upādhyāyikā*), [the śikṣamāṇā] should make the request of her in the following manner: 'Female Preceptor, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so am requesting the female preceptor to be the female preceptor. Female Preceptor, please be my female preceptor. I request to be fully ordained132 by the female preceptor.'
133 132 Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa*, Skt. missing (gap in the ms). Mvy 8715 bsnyen par rdzogs pa (*upasaṃpanna*). Negi: Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs p*a: 1. Skt. upasaṃ-*pādanam*; 2. Skt. *upasampat* - Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa'i cho ga*, Skt. 

upasampadvidhi. BHSD: *upasaṃpad*, and °*padā*, f. 2. ordination (as monk or nun) four kinds (svāma-upasa*ṃpadā* - self ordination, ehibhikṣukāyaupasaṃpadā - '*bhik*ṣu, come here' ordination, daśavargena-upasa*ṃpadā* ‒ 
ordination by a group of ten, pañcavargena-upasa*ṃpadā* - ordination by a group of five); *upasaṃpanna*, adj. ordained (as a monk). This list of four is of the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravādins. The Mūlasarvāstivādins have a more extended list, which consists of ten. For instance, the *Vinayottaragrantha*, Kanjur D 6 ('dul ba), pa, 234 b7-235 a3; see also Tsering (2010: 163–164) and Pruden (1991: 
592). For the Pāli parallel, see Pāli Vin II 272.8‒9, Cv X.17, cf. Horner (1938‒ 1966: v.376): "Paṭhamaṃ upajjhaṃ *gāhāpetabbā* (First she should be invited to choose a woman preceptor (*upajjhā*)". From two unpublished ordination rites used during recent *bhikkhunī* ordinations, it is clear that the actual *bhikkhunī* kammavācās used today are much more elaborate on this point. These two manuals are: 1.) "Higher Ordination Ceremony. Tapodhanaramaya Temple, Mount Lavinia, March 3–4–2002, edited by the Samasta Lanka Sasanaloka Bhikkhuni Association, Newgala Bhikkhuni Hermitage, Galigamuwa Town, Kegalle," and 2.) Bhikkhunī Vuṭṭhāpana at Aranya Bodhi 29 August 2010. While both Pāli texts read: "*Pavattinī me, ayye, hohi*" (May you be my Pavattinī, Ayyā), the first translates into English, "Oh Venerable One, may you be my Upajjhāya therī," while the second translates, "May you be my preceptor, Venerable." 
Kieffer-Pülz (2005: 232) emphasizes that, to her knowledge, *kammavācā* collections of formularies for the Theravādin order of nuns have not been handed down, which is most likely connected with the extinction of the Theravādin order of nuns in the 10th century. The countless preserved *kammavācā* collections of the Theravadin were all assigned to the monks' order. From this we can conclude that the *kammavācā* formularies used for *bhikkhunī* ordination today, have been drawn up by today's Vinaya scholars involved in those ordinations based on the authoritative Vinaya texts and most probably using formularies assigned to the monks as a pattern.

133 In EKŚ(D) in case of an upādhyāyikā (*mkhan mo*) and ācāryikā (*slob dpon ma*) 
the *karmavācanā*s are shortened and in case of another senior nun (Tib. *'phags* ma, Skt. *āryikā*) the *karmavācanā* appears in its full form: EKŚ(D) 123 a5–
123b1: 'di ltar gsol ba bya ste | mkhan mo la phyag 'tshal du bcug nas | *mdun du* stan nang tshangs can la sogs pa'i steng du ci bder 'dug tu bcug ste | thal mo sbyar du bcug nas | gal te mkhan mo yin na mkhan mo zhes brjod par bya | *slob* dpon yin na slob dpon zhes brjod par bya | *'phags ma yin na 'phags ma zhes ci* rigs par brjod par bya'o zhes bstan nas | des 'di skad ces brjod par bya ste | *'phags* ma dgongs su gsol | bdag ming 'di zhes bgyi ba 'phags ma la mkhan mor gsol gyis

## Iii.I.1.1.2.3 Request For An Ācāryikā To Become The Female Preceptor

If [the bhik*ṣuṇī* addressed] is an *ācāryikā*, [the *śikṣamāṇā*] should request her as follows: 'Ācāryikā, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of soand-so request the *ācāryikā* to be my female preceptor. Ācāryikā, please be my female preceptor. I request to be fully ordained134 by the *ācāryikā* as female preceptor.' This [is to be repeated] a second and third time.

## Iii.I.1.1.3 Sanctioning135 The Five Robes

Then the robes should be sanctioned:136'Female Preceptor, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so am going to sanction this outer | 'phags ma bdag gi mkhan mo mdzad du gsol | 'phags ma mkhan mos bsnyen par rdzogs par bgyi'o | | de bzhin du lan gnyis lan gsum du bzlas | tshig gsum pa la mkhan mo zhes brjod par bya'o | | *mkhan mos thabs yin no zhes brjod par bya'o* | | slob mas *legs so zhes brjod par bya'o* | | *de ni mkhan mor gsol ba'o.* See also Uj II.iii.1.1.2.2. 

134 At this point, one might expect an expression of assent by the female preceptor, as on other occasions. For example, compare above when *śikṣamāṇā* training is requested. There the *upādhyāyikā* accepts by saying, 'This is the method,' and the disciple replys, 'It is excellent.'
135 R/VP 124 translates "Benediction" of the cloth and the bowl (15a). SWTF: 
adhi*ṣṭhā* 1 ‒ in Besitz nehmen, in Gebrauch nehmen, behalten (to take in possession, to take in use, to keep); Mvy 4264 byin brlabs pa (adhi*ṣṭhāna*). Cf. Härtel (1956: 74 § 32); BHSD: adhi*ṣṭhāna*. Bhīk 15a1 *aham ... ādhiṣṭhāmi* I take 
(formal) possession. Acc. to Geshe Thubten Ngawang (personal communication, 1996), *byin gyis brlab pa* means also: to convert, to transfer, to change into. In the Tibetan Vinaya context '*byin gyis brlabs pa*' is understood to entail a process of authorizing, whereby something that had been unsuitable to use, own or do is rendered into something suitable to use, own or do. In the case of an action, for example, although it is normally forbidden to go beyond the boundary of the rainy-season retreat, under certain circumstances it can become permissible to leave the retreat for up to seven days, through the process of authorizing the act by '*byin gyis brlabs*.' In the case of authorizing articles for use by monastics, we have opted to translate the term as 'consecrate'. For actions that are made permissible, we use the translation 'authorize'.

136 Uj II.iii.1.1.3.1a reads here: *de'i 'og tu mkhan po rang gis de la chos gos gsum* byin gyis brlab par bya'o. This should be understood to mean that the male preceptor authorizes the use of the three robes by the candidate who can then take them into his formal possession. 

upper robe137. The sewing of this robe is complete, and it is fit for use.

138' 139
[She should state this] similarly a second and third time. 'I am likewise going to sanction the inner upper robe, 140 the lower robe, 141 the breast covering, 142 and the sweat cloth143.

144'

## Iii.I.1.1.4 Verification Of The Alms Bowl

Next the alms bowl145 is to be shown to the bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha [Skt. saying: 
'Venerables, may I please have your attention. This alms bowl is not too small for the Venerable so-and-so, nor is it too big or too pale.

146' 147 All] the bhikṣuṇīs should say: 'The alms bowl is good.'

## Iii.I.1.1.5 Sanctioning The Alms Bowl148

Then the alms bowl (Tib. *lhung bzed*, Skt. pātra) should be sanctioned. Taking the alms bowl in the left hand and covering it with the right, she should say:]149'Female Preceptor, may I please have your attention. I, by the name of so-and-so sanction this sage's bowl150 for use as a begging bowl.

151 It is fit for use for food.' This should [be stated] a second and third time. 

III.i.1.2 Appointment of the Private Instructor by the Bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha

## Iii.I.1.2.1 Preparation For Interrogation Within Sight But Out Of Earshot

Following that, she should be placed in a spot apart from the assembly, within sight but out of earshot, [Skt. incline physically,] and place her palms together.

152 Then the *bhikṣu*ṇī who is the *karmācāryikā* should say: 'What is the name of the person who should be asked to be private instructor? Please speak.' The person who has been appointed, for her part, should reply, 'I, by the name of so-and-so.'

## Iii.I.1.2.2 Confirmation Of Willingness Of The Private Instructor

Then the karmakārikā *bhikṣu*ṇī should ensure willingness.

153'Do you, by the name of so-and-so, wish to do the private instruction of so-and-so under the female preceptor by the name of so-and-so?' If she wishes to do so, she should say: 'I wish to.'

## Iii.I.1.2.3 Installation In Office Through Sole Motion (Muktikājñapti)

Then the karmakārikā *bhikṣu*ṇī should file a sole motion:
154'Members of the noble female *saṃgha*, please listen. The female preceptor is so-and-so; since so-and-so is willing to be the private instructor of so-and-so, and since the noble female saṃgha considers the moment to be right, may the members of the noble female saṃgha grant their permission. She will privately instruct 
[the *śikṣamāṇā*] so-and-so with so-and-so as female preceptor.' This is the motion.

III.i.1.3 Interrogation of the Candidate **within Sight but out of** Earshot

## Iii.I.1.3.1 Exhortation To Honesty By The Private Instructor155

156Then the private instructor should have [the *śikṣamāṇā*] squat in front of her and join her palms, and then she should say to her: 'Please listen, so-andso. This is your time to tell the truth. This is the right time.

157 I will ask you just a few questions, and you, without hesitation, should say without mistake: "It is," when it is the case, and "It is not," when it is not the case.'
158 III.i.1.3.2 Interrogation Concerning the Obstructive Conditions 
(āntar*āyika dharma*s)159 1. 'Are you a woman (*strī*)?' 'I am a woman.'
160 2. 'Have you reached the age of twelve, in the case of someone living in a household (gṛho*ṣiṭā*) or the age of twenty, as an unmarried woman (*kumārikā*)?' 'I have reached it.'
3. 'Do you have the five robes and alms bowl?' 'I have them.'
4. 'Are your father161 and mother [Skt. or]162 your husband163 alive?'
164 5. 'Do you have permission from your father and mother or your husband?'
165 6. 'You are not a slave, are you?' [Skt.: She should say, 'No, I am not.'] 
7. 'You are not someone who has been abducted (*āhṛtikā*)
166, are you?'
8. 'You are not someone who has been sold (*vikrītikā*),167 are you?'
161 Note that the Tibetan changes the order. The Skt. lists first the mother, then the father. 

162 Although the Tibetan reads *dang* (and), the Skt. is interested in either a) the parents or b) the husband, presumably because when a woman marries she is considered to be transferred from the former to the latter, so that only one set of 
'guardians' has authority over her at any given stage of life, depending on whether she is married or not. 

163 The Sanskrit has the mother and father paired together as one term in the dual and asks whether they are alive, using a verb in the dual, and then asks whether the husband in the singular is alive using a verb in the singular. jīvatas mātāpitarau svāmi vā jīvati. Thus, the sense is: Are your parents alive or is your husband alive?

164 RLS add.: They are alive.

165 RSJKQD add.: I have permission.

166 Tib. phrogs pa */ brkus pa*. The Tibetan editions RLS read *brkus pa ma yin nam*, 
while JKQD read *phrogs pa ma yin nam*, both having *āhṛtikā* as their equivalent. The clearest Tibetan gloss on the term comes in the Kalyāṇamitra (Dge legs bshes gynen), Vinayavastuṭīkā ('Dul ba *gzhi rgya cher 'grel pa*), Tanjur D 4113 
('dul ba), tsu, 249b3 *brkus pa zhes bya ba ni gzhan gyi rgyal srid las gya tshom* du mthus bkug pa'o. See Schopen (2010) for a fuller exploration of the terms relating to servitude and slavery in this passage. Schopen similarly argues that āhṛtikā (āhṛ*taka*) indicates an unfree laborer, based, in large part, on this Vinayavastu*ṭīkā* gloss. As Schopen also notes, there is some contention as to which Tibetan term is rendering which Sanskrit term, and one sees that this problem is further compounded when taking into consideration the numerous inconsistencies in the order of the questions among the Tibetan editions, which Schopen does not consider. Edgerton in his BHSD rather tentatively suggests 'hired servant (of some particular kind).' We must disagree with Härtel (1956: 78 no. 

8): "Du hast nichts gestohlen?" (You have not stolen anything, have you?). 

167 Tib. btsongs pa.

9. 'You are not a pawn (*prāptikā*),
168 are you?'
10. 'You are not someone who has offered herself as a servant in lieu of payment of a loan (*vaktavyikā*),
169 are you?'
11. 'You are not desired by anyone, are you?'
170 12. 'You are not a magical apparition, are you?'
171 13. 'You are not in service to the king, are you?'
172 14. 'You do not bear a grudge against the king, do you?'
173 15. 'You are not someone who acts to harm the king, are you?'
174 168 Tib. *rnyed btson*. Sch 253 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 16 a4 continues with *mā vikrītikā* | mā prāptikā | m*ā vaktavyikā*. The Tibetan editions vary, appearing either as rnyed pa ma yin nam/ btsongs pa ma yin nam/ rtsod pa med dam (JKQD), or btsongs pa ma yin nam/ rnyed btson ma yin nam/ rtsod pa me dam (RLS). Meanwhile, Uj II.iii.1.3.2 reads for the Tibetan in yet a different order: rnyed btson ma yin nam/ 
rtsod pa can ma yin nam/ btsongs pa ma yin nam, while the Sanskrit for Uj has another order, i.e., mā prāptako, mā vaktavyako, mā āhṛtako, *mā vikrītako*. The Tibetan RLS editions omit the question "*rnyed pa ma yin nam*" and read (correctly, in our view) *rnyed btson ma yin nam* instead of "rnyed pa ma yin nam." BHSD: *prāptikā* (f. to *prāptaka*). 

169 Tib. *rtsod pa med dam*. We base our translation of this term on the gloss given in the Vinayavastuṭīkā (*'Dul ba gzhi rgya cher 'grel pa*), Tanjur D 4113 (*'dul* ba), tsu, 249b3–4: *rtsod pa can zhes bya ba ni skyin po la sogs pa blangs nas* phyis 'tsho ba ma lus pa na bran nyid du bsgos pa'o. JKQD add here (b)rkus pa ma yin nam. See antarāyika*-dharma* 9 (alternative RLS reading to *phrogs pa*).

170 No Skt. equivalent, and not appearing in the Uj list. Among the Tibetan editions only R reads this question together with the one before as one question: *rtsod pa* dam gzhan gyi chags pa med dam.

171 Tib. *sprul pa*, Skt. *nirmitikā*. RLSD add here "You are not an animal, are you?" 
which is neither attested in the Sanskrit nor in any Tshal pa edition. Against this, Uj reads "*sprul pa ma yin nam/ dud 'gro ma yin nam*", while Härtel (1956: 79–
80) has: 31. *mā nāgaḥ* (You are not a nāga?), 32. *mā paśuḥ* (You are not an animal?). 

172 Tib. *rgyal po la gtses pa ma yin nam*. The BhīKaVā continues with four questions related to the king: mā rājabhaṭī | mā rājakilviṣakāriṇī | mā rājāpathyakarmmakāriṇī | mā tvayā rājāpathyaṃ karmma k*ṛtam vā kāritam vā*. Similarly, Härtel (1956: 79 no. 12–15). Meanwhile, Uj reads: rgyal pos bkrabs pa ma yin nam.

173 Tib. *rgyal po dang 'khon pa ma yin nam*. But Uj reads: *rgyal po la bsdigs pa ma* yin nam.

174 Tib. rgyal po la gnod pa'i las byed pa ma yin nam.

16. 'You are not someone who has acted to harm the king or instigated others to do so, are you?'
175 17. 'You are not vicious, are you?'
176 18. 'You are not overcome with grief, are you?'
177 19. 'You are not pregnant, are you?'
20. 'You do not lack genitals, do you?'
178 21. 'You do not have both [male and female] genitals (ubhaya-*vyañjanā*),
179 do you?'
22. 'You do not have conjoined genitals, do you?'
23. 'You do not menstruate continually, do you?' 24. 'You do not suffer from amenorrhea, do you?'
180 25. 'You do not have ambiguous sexual characteristics, do you?'
181 26. 'You have not seduced a *bhikṣu*, have you?' 27. 'You have not killed your father, have you?'
182 175 Tib. khyod kyis rgyal p*o la gnod pa'i las byas sam byed du bcug pa ma yin nam*.

176 Tib. *mi srun pa ma yin nam*. Skt ca*ṇḍā.* 177 Tib. *mya ngan gyis gdungs pa ma yin nam*. Skt. *śokahatā*. Frances Wilson remarks with reference to this question that "an initiate is not supposed to be, among other things, grief-stricken (*śokhata*). Yet grief at the death of relatives is often associated with joining the order. Society forced women to sever their familiy ties before joining the order, yet they were not supposed to be griefstricken to enter the order" (Paul 1979: 82).

178 Tib. *mtshan med pa*. Different from above II.iii.1.7 the Skt. ms. has here avya*ṃñjanā*, which is not attested elsewhere, also not in NWS. Härtel (1956: 79 no. 17) has instead "śaṇṭ*haka*ḥ" (misspelled ṣaṇḍha) which he translates as impotent. Here asexual or lacking genitals by birth seems to be meant. No Mvy entry for *avyañjanā.* PW: avyañjana Adj. (f. ā) "bartlos, ohne Pubes Spr. 765" (beardless, without pubic hair). Uj reads: *za ma ma yin nam*. Mvy 8774 has za ma (ṣaṇḍha). PW: ṣaṇḍha Adj. (f. ī.) zeugungsunfähig; m. Eunuch und Zweiter GAUT. VASIṢṬHA 14,2. *yoni* f. die vulva eines Weibes, das weder Regeln noch Brüste hat (infertile; m. Eunuch and Second GAUT. VASIṢṬHA 14,2. *yoni* f. 

the vulva of a woman who has neither rules nor breasts).

179 Tib. *mtshan gnyis pa*. Mvy 8775 has the masculine form: *mtshan gnyis pa*
(*ubhayavyañjana*ḥ). Härtel (1956: 79 no. 18) has instead "paṇḍakaḥ" which he translates as eunuch, but in the case of a woman, this hardly makes sense. Uj reads: ma ning ma yin nam. Cf. Mvy 8768 ma ning (*paṇḍaka*). PW: Eunuch, ein Impotenter (eunuch, an impotent).

180 Cf. BHSD: *alohinī* - a woman who does not menstruate Mvy 8929.

181 Mvy 8930. Cf. BHSD *naimittikī*.

182 In Sanskrit the mother comes first, then the father.

28. 'You have not killed your mother, have you?'
29. 'You have not killed an *arhat*, have you?' 30. 'You have not shed the blood of a *tathāgata* with malicious intent, have you?'
31. 'You are not an adherent of a non-Buddhist sect (*tīrthikā*183), are you?'
32. 'You have not gone over to the *tīrthikā*s, have you?'184 33. 'You are not a notorious bandit, are185 you?' 34. 'You are not one who lives by theft, are you?'186 35. 'You are not someone who one who lives apart (*nānāsaṃvāsikā*), 
are you?'187 36. 'You are not someone who is not entitled to live [with the order]
(asa*ṃvāsikā*), are you?'
188 183 Tib. *mu stegs can*, Skt. *tīrthikā*. 184 Cf. BHSD *avakrāntaka*, also °ika, f. °ikā. Mvy 8759, Bhīk 16b2.

185 Härtel (1956: 79, no. 16). Although in Skt this appears as if it were two separate questions (mā caurī || *mā dhvajabaddhikā*) - a fact that vexed Edgerton in his reading - Guṇaprabha in his autocommentary treats the two as one. *Vinayasūtra* 149 (na cauraṁ dhvajabaddhakaṁ pravrājayeyuḥ upasa*ṁpādayeyurvā*). See also Mvy 8799 chom rkun por grags pa (*cauro dhvaja-baddhaka*).

186 Tib. rkun *gnas pa ma yin nam*] JKQD : rku thabs su *gnas pa ma yin nam* RLS. 

Skt. *mā steyasamvāsikā* Sch 253 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 16 b2. Härtel (1956: 79, no. 

21): "Du bist keiner, der heimlich (im Orden) weilt (ohne ordiniert zu sein)?", 
i.e., you are not one who tries to associate himself with a Buddhist monastic community without a right to it? BSHD steya-sa*ṃvāsika*, f. °kā lit. a thief(-like) 
inhabitant. Literally "one who belongs to a communion by theft."
187 Skt. *nānāsaṃvāsika*/~kā, Tib. *so sor gnas pa*. Cf. Tsedroen (2016, 202-203 note 69 and 218). Härtel (1956: 79, no. 22, 79 note 6). One who is suspended from the order due to a sa*ṃghāvaśeṣ*a and undergoes "*mānatrā".* As far as I know mānatrā is not attested in Sanskrit and assume Härtel means *mānatva* (Tib. mgu bar bya ba Mvy 8652 *mānāpya*, °tvā) or respectively *parivāsa* (Tib. *spo ba* Mvy 8649; for concealment of a sa*ṃghāvaśeṣ*a). This refers either to a person temporarily suspended from the order or to persons who have voluntarily chosen to distance themselves from their legal community. See below p. 304 note 63, to become nānāsa*ṃvāsika/~kā* by disciplinary measures incurred to them, is only one of three possibilities to become nānāsa*ṃvāsika/~kā*.

188 Tib. *mi gnas pa*. Härtel (1956: 79, no. 23, 79 note 7). BSHD: being denied the right of living with the order. Cf. Tsedroen (2016: 202–203n69): asa*ṃvāsika* (Tib. mi gnas pa/ *gnas par mi bya ba*, Mvy 8758).

## Iii.I.1.3.3 Interrogation Concerning Additional Matters189

37. 'Had you gone forth previously?'
190 If she replies to that, 'Yes, I had gone forth [previously],' then say, 'In that case, you may leave.' But if she replies, 'I had not gone forth [previously],'
191 then ask: 
38. 'Have you now gone forth and practiced chastity well?'
192'I have.'
39. 'Have you requested the two years' training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s from the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*?' 'I have requested it.'
40. 'Have you trained for two years in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s?' 'I have trained.'
193 41. 'You do not owe any debts to anyone, whether much or little, do you?'
194 42. 'What is your name?' 'What is the name of your female preceptor?'
She should reply, 'My name is so-and-so. I will utter her name for 189 Cf. Uj II.iii.1.3.3. 190 This seems to indicate that in ancient times, *pravrajyā* and upasa*ṃpadā* were the same and that the practice of ordaining in stages, with *śrāmaṇerikā* and śikṣamāṇā coming between *pravrajyā* and upasa*ṃpadā*, developed only later. Otherwise, everybody would need to reply, 'I have left home previously.' Accordingly, this formula would have different text layers, with the original version having been modified later. Cf. Jin-il Chung (2011: 7–12).

191 See also Uj II.iii.1.3.3. 192 Härtel (1956: 80, no. 38) (Skt. same): "Du bist den rechten Keuschheitswandel gewandelt?"
193 The following questions are not found in Sanskrit and are omitted in S and Q.

They are included in all the remaining editions considered: 'Did the bhik*ṣuṇī* saṃgha bestow on you the *brahmacaryopasthānasaṃvṛ*ti?' 'They bestowed it.' 
'Have the required preliminary acts been done by the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*?' 'They have been done.' 'Have you behaved respectfuly toward the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*?' 'I have behaved respectfully.' '[Are you] completely free of the obstructive conditions?' 'I am completely free.' The first question in particular is anomalous, as the *tshangs par spyad pa skyed pa'i sdom* pa has not yet been bestowed at this point in the ritual.

194 Cf. Härtel (1956: 80 no. 33). Skt. lit. 'You do not owe anyone anything, whether much or little, do you?' In the repetition of this list when the candidate is being interrogated by the karmakārak*a bhikṣu* at III.ii.3.3 below, this appears as number 45 in the list.

## Iii.I.1.3.4 Interrogation Concerning Diseases

'You by the name of so-and-so, please listen. A woman's body can be harmed by diseases such as the following:196 1. leprosy (mdze, *kuṣṭha*)
197 2. goiter ('bras, *gaṇḍa*)
198 3. exanthema (shu ba, kiṭ*ibha*)
199 4. leukoderma (phol mig, *kilāsa*)
200 5. ringworm (tshad pa, *dadr*ū)

203 8. carbuncle (klog pa/glog pa, *rajata*)
204 9. psoriasis (rab tu g.ya' ba, *vicarcikā*)
205 10. labored breathing (skyigs bu, *hikkā*)
206 11. vomiting, nausea (skyugs pa, *charddi*)
12. hemorrhoids (gzhang 'brum, *arśāṃ*si)
207 13. infection or epidemic (rims, *jvara*)
208 14. pulmonary consumption (zad pa, kṣaya)
209 15. insanity (*myos pa*)
210 16. fatigue (ngal ba, *klama*)
211 204 Tib. *klog pa*. Different spelling or misspelling of *glog pa*. Cf. Uj II.iii.1.3.4 which in Skt. reads like our BhīKaVā ms. and has *rajata* for the Tib. *glog pa*. Acc. to Jä = *lhog pa* ‒ carbuncle.

205 Tib. *rab tu g.ya' ba* (variant reading *rab tu g.yan pa* only here, but below only rab tu g.ya' ba). LCh *g.yan pa*: 1. *kacchū*, 2. kaṇḍū, 3. *pāmā*. Härtel (1956: 81) 
vicarcikā: Nässende Flechte (*psoriasis*).

206 Härtel (1956: 81, no. 11): "Schlucken." The order of this and the following two items is different in the later iteration of this list at III.ii.3.5. In that later list, vomiting is followed by hemorrhoids and only then is labored breathing mentioned. 

207 BSHD: *arśāṅ*gi, refers to Mvy 9518 and Bhīk 17a1. Cf. Mvy 9518 *arśāṅ*gi; arśāṅgikuṣṭam: gzhang 'grum; *zhang 'brum*. Härtel (1956: 81 no. 25) *arśaṃ*si Hämorrhoiden. Not in Wille (1990: 150–151).

208 Härtel (1956: 81, no. 12): "Fieber." The Skt. is definitely fever but the Tibetan term *rims* means an infectious disease passing from one person to the other, whereas fever is *tsha ba*. 

209 In Skt. no. 15 as stated in the comparative concordance in Wille 1990: 150).

228 Not in this formulation of the Skt. list but it does appear as *prajvara* in the subsequent at III.ii.3.5. Mvy 9530 rim drag po (*prajvara*). BSHD: virulent contagious disease, doubtless a fever. Cf. Uj II.iii.1.3.4: "jvaraḥ *prajvara*ḥ ekāhiko dvitīyakaḥ tṛtīyakaś caturthakaḥ sāṃnipātikaḥ *satatajvaro* viṣamajvaraḥ."

## Iii.I.1.3.5 Instruction By The Private Instructor To Come For Interrogation In The Midst Of The Saṃgha238

difficulty, and even if cured it leaves behind some permanent defect." Like Āyurveda with its three doṣas (vāyu, pitta, *kapha*), Tibetan medicine speaks of wind or movement energy (*lung*), bile or hot energy (*khris pa*), and cold energy or phlegm (*bad kan*). 

235 Härtel (1956: 81, no. 33): *nityajvara* "Ununterbrochenes Fieber." MW: one not intermitting. Mvy 9535 rtag pa'i rims (*nityajvara*). Note that in the later list of health conditions, the order of this and the next is inverted, with intermittent chronic fever appearing before constant fever. Not in Wille 1990 (150–151).

She declared herself to be completely free [of such conditions]. May she come?'

## Iii.I.2.1.2 Approval By The Saṃgha241

All the *bhikṣu*ṇīs should say: 'If she is free [of obstructive conditions], let her come.' If they say this, that is excellent. If not, they will be guilty of a transgression.

## Iii.I.2.1.3 Actual Request For Brahmacaryopasthānasamvṛti By The Śikṣamāṇā

Then the *karmakārikā* should have the [*śikṣamāṇā*] sit in front of her and request the brahmacaryopasthāna*samvṛti* (consent to practice as a celibate):
'Members of the noble female *saṃgha*, please listen. I, by the name of soand-so seek full ordination under [Skt: the female preceptor] so-and-so. Since I, by the name of so-and-so am requesting the brahmacaryo*pasthānasamvṛ*ti from the noble female saṃgha members, I will utter her name for the purpose 
[of correctly identifying her:] female preceptor so-and-so. I, by the name of so-and-so request the brahmacaryo*pasthānasamvṛ*ti from the noble female saṃgha. May the compassionate for the sake of compassion [grant242 it].'
This should be done a second and third time.

III.i.2.2 Interrogation Concerning the Obstructive Conditions in the Midst of the Saṃgha III.i.2.2.1 Motion by the Karmakārikā **for Interrogation Concerning the Obstructive Conditions in the Midst of the Saṃgha**
Next, the karmakārikā-*bhikṣu*ṇī should make the [following] motion, and then institute the act: 'Members of the noble female saṃgha, please listen. This [person] by the name of so-and-so is seeking full ordination (upasa*ṃpadā*) from the female preceptor so-and-so. Thus this [*śikṣamāṇā*] 
by the name of so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so, requests the brahmacaryopasthāna*samvṛti* from the noble female *saṃgha* members. If the members of the noble female *saṃgha* consider the moment to be right, may the members of the noble female saṃgha grant their permission. I, by the name of so-and-so will interrogate [her] about the obstructive conditions [for ordination] in the midst of the saṃgha [now].' This is the motion.

## Iii.I.2.2.2 Interrogation In The Midst Of The Saṃgha Concerning The Obstructive Conditions243

'You, by the name of so-and-so, listen. This is your time to tell the truth. This is the right time. I will ask you just a few questions, and you should not be embarrassed, but answer correctly, "It is," when something is the case, and "it is not", when something is not the case.'
244

## Iii.I.2.2.3 Repetition Of The Interrogation

[Here the same passage above]245 has to be applied, from 'Are you a woman?'
'I am a woman,' up to 'Do you have any such diseases or any other physical conditions?' 'I do not.'

## Iii.I.2.3 Actual Granting Of Brahmacaryopasthānasamvṛti

III.i.2.3.1 Motion by the Presiding Official for Brahmacaryopa-sthānasaṃvṛti 246 Then she should make the [following] motion. 'Noble female *saṃgha* members, please listen. This [*śikṣamāṇā*] by the name of so-and-so is seeking full ordination under the female preceptor so-and-so. She has reached the age of twelve247 in the case of someone who has been married or the age of twenty years as an unmarried woman, and she also has the five robes and alms bowl. She also says she is free of obstructive conditions. This [*śikṣamāṇā*] with the name so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so, requests the brahmacaryopasthāna*samvṛti* of the noble female *saṃgha* members. If the members of the noble female *saṃgha* consider the moment to be right, may the members of the noble female saṃgha grant the brahmacaryopasthāna*samvṛti* to [the *śikṣamāṇā*] so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so. So-andso acts as female preceptor. This is the motion.'

## Iii.I.2.3.2 Proclamation Of The Actual Act (Karmavācanā) By The Karmakārikā

The act has to be instituted as follows: 'Noble female saṃgha members, please listen. This [*śikṣamāṇā*] by the name of so-and-so is seeking full ordination under the female preceptor so-and-so. She has reached the age of twelve years in the case of someone living in a household or the age of twenty years as an unmarried woman, and she has the five robes and alms bowl as well. She also says that she is free of obstructive conditions. This [*śikṣamāṇā*] 
with the name so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so, requests the noble female *saṃgha* members to grant her consent to practice as a celibate
(brahmacaryopasthāna*samvṛti*). May the noble female saṃgha members please grant consent to practice as a celibate to this [*śikṣamāṇā*] with the name so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so. Those noble female saṃgha members who agree to grant consent to practice as a celibate to this 
[*śikṣamāṇā*] by the name of so-and-so, under the female preceptor so-and-so, remain silent. Those, who do not agree, please speak.' [Skt. This is the first karmavācanā. It should be declared a second and a third time.]248

## Iii.I.2.3.3 Announcement Of The Resolution

"The noble female saṃgha members grant their consent to practice as a celibate (brahmacaryopasthāna*samv*ṛti) to this [*śikṣamāṇā*] with the name so, under the female preceptor so-and-so. By remaining silent, the *saṃgha* of female noble ones has agreed and granted its permission. I hereby declare it so."
Tsewang Nyima (Tshe-dbang-nyi-ma 2009: 835) published in Dharamsala reflects this (mis)understanding of the requirements for conferring brahmacaryopasthānasaṃvṛti: tshangs spyod nyer gnas kyi sdom pa: *tshangs spyod nyer* gnas kyi sdom pa dge slong ma sgrub khar ma bcu gnyis kyis bar chad dris te dag pa dang/ gos lnga byin nas gsol gnyis kyi las *brjod pa nas tshangs spyod nyer* gnas pa zer ba tsam las sdom pa gsar pa thob rgyu med pas de'i rgyud kyi dge slong ma'i [read: dge slob ma'i] *sdom pa de/ tshangs spyod nyer gnas kyi sdom* pa 'di yin gyi/ de las logs su med do// [Cf. ZHD: *tshangs spyod nyer gnas kyi* sdom pa: dge slong ma'i sdom pa dgnos ma blangs sngon la 'bog pa'i sdom pa zhig ste/ dge slob ma'i sdom pa dang rdzas rigs gcig pa bar ma'i tshul khrims so] dge slob ma'i sdom pa dge tshul ma dang bsnyen rdzogs kyi bar du lo gnyis su gtso bor spyad dgos kyang/ de phan gt*ong ba min te/ rgya cher 'grel las/ de spyad* pa'i dus ni lo gnyis so// lo gnyis las lhag na yang de phyin chad nyams par mi 'gyur la/ de phyin chad mi bsrung bar bya ba'ang min no zhes gsung pa'i phyir
(Just before giving *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination, after having asked [the candidate] about the obstructions, [having determined her] to be free [of those conditions], and having given her the five robes, the so-called brahmacaryo*pasthāna* vow is given through jñapti-dvitīya-*karman* by twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs. [The candidate] is just called "celibate" without receiving a new vow (Tib. *sdom pa*), because the bhik*ṣuṇī* vow [read: *śikṣamāṇā* vow] in the continuum [of this person] is the brahmacaryopasthāna vow and not different from it. [Cf. ZHD: brahmacaryopa-*sthāna* vow: preliminary vow before taking the actual *bhikṣu*ṇī vow, an intermediate discipline which is of one substantial type with the *śikṣamāṇā* vow.] Although the *śikṣamāṇā* vow has to be mainly practiced for a period of two years between the [time as a] *śrāmaṇerikā* and the fully ordained [person], the benefit is not cast away [after this time], since in the *Rgya cher 'grel* it is said: 'The time for its practice is two years:' Even if it is [practiced] longer than two years, after that it does not degenerate, and it is also not so that after that, it is no longer to be observed." Cf. Derge Tanjur, *Las brgya rtsa gcig pa* D 4118, 120b and *Rgya* cher 'grel pa D 4120, 'u, 78a. The latter reads slightly differently from what is quoted here, i.e., the "observance/vow (Tib. *brtul gzhugs*, Skt. *vrata*)" does not degenerate: *de spyad pa'i dus ni lo gnyis so// lo gnyis las lhag na yang de phyin* chad brtul zhugs de *nyams par mi 'gyur la, de phyin chad mi bsrung bar bya* ba'ang min no. Jä Tib. *brtul gzhugs*, Skt. *vrata*. MW renders *vrata* as "observance, vow." Cf. BHSD vrata-*pada* (Pā. vata-pada).

III.ii Karma in the Presence of the Twofold Saṃgha (*ubhayasaṃgha*)
249

## Iii.Ii.1 Gathering Of The Twofold Saṃgha In Separate Boundaries

Then, after the entire *bhikṣusaṃgha*, comprised of at least ten *bhikṣu*s, has gathered and been seated within a small boundary (Tib. '*khor*, Skt. *maṇḍalaka*),
250 and the entire bhikṣuṇī*saṃgha*, comprised of at least twelve bhikṣuṇīs,251 has gathered and been seated within a small boundary, [the candidate] should be placed in front of the karmakāraka*-bhikṣu*, upon a bundle of grass (Tib. *rtsa chun po*, Skt. *viṇḍaka*) or on a hollow cushion (Tib. khong tshangs can, Skt. *masūrikā*),
252 join her palms together, and request full ordination from the twofold *saṃgha.*
253

## Iii.Ii.2 Request For Upasaṃpadā In The Presence Of The Twofold Saṃgha

'Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha.

254 I, by the name of so-and-so am an applicant seeking full ordination255 under the female preceptor whose name so-and-so I utter for the purpose [of correctly identifying her]. I, by the name of so-and-so request full ordination from the twofold *saṃgha*. Venerable members of the twofold *saṃgha*, please fully ordain me. 

Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please raise me up.

256 Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please take care of me. Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please be compassionate to me. Compassionate ones, for the sake of compassion, [Skt: please grant your acceptance].' This should be stated a second and a third time.

functions as an agent, it does so in the singular, even in sentences that include a vocative plural. This gives us the curious mingling of singular and plural in the frequent opening to an utterance: "śṛṇotu bhadantā ubhayasaṃgha" ‒ Eng. 

"Venerables (plural), may the twofold saṃgha (singular) listen (singular)." In Tibetan, the careful separation of singular collective agent from plural audience in the vocative is not maintained. This same phrase is rendered at times in Tibetan as "*gson cig btsun pa'i dge 'dun sde gnyis rnams*" and at times as "gson cig bt*sun pa'i dge 'dun gnyi ga'i rnams*." Moreover, we often find internal discrepancies among the various Tibetan editions on this point. In general, when translating singular forms of the noun *ubhayasaṃgha*, the Tibetan translates ubhayasaṃgha as both dge 'dun *sde gnyis* (two communities of the saṃgha) or dge 'dun gnyis ka (both *saṃgha*s), thus preserving the ambiguity (or furthering the confusion). Moreover, the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* also functions on its own as a saṃgha, grammatically at least, as of course does the bhikṣu *saṃgha*. We will translate ubhayasaṃgha as twofold *saṃgha, whether* the Tibetan has *dge 'dun* gnyis ka (both saṃghas) or *dge 'dun sde gnyis* (two communities of the saṃgha).

254 Skt. bhadantā ubhayasaṃgha. Tibetan here has *btsun pa'i dge 'dun gnyi ga'i* rnams or *btsun pa'i dge 'dun gnyi rnams* in variant readings. 

255 The Skt. noun *upasaṃpatprekṣi*ṇī (applicant for full ordination) is rendered in Tibetan in verbal form as *bsnyen par rdzogs par 'tshal* (ba).

256 Tib. *bdag dbyung bar gsol*, Skt. ullu*ṃpatu māṃ*. BSHD: ulluṃpati, *ulluṃpatu*. 

Cf. Pāli, Bhikkhunī Vuṭṭhāpana Bodhinyana Monastery 22nd October 2009: 6: 
Ullumpatu mam, ayye, saṅgho anukampaṃ *upādāya* "May the Saṅgha raise me up out of compassion."
III.ii.3 Interrogation Concerning the Obstructive Conditions in the Midst of the Twofold Saṃgha III.ii.3.1 Motion by the Karmakāraka-bhikṣu for Interrogation Concerning the Obstructive Conditions in the Midst of the Twofold Saṃgha After that the karmakāraka-*bhikṣu* should make the motion (*jñapti*): 'Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please listen. This [person] by the name of so-and-so requests full ordination with so-and-so as her female preceptor. Thus this [person] with the name so-and-so, with so-and-so as her female preceptor, requests full ordination from the twofold *saṃgha*. If the moment is right and the twofold *saṃgha* agrees to it, may the twofold saṃgha grant its permission. I, by the name of so-and-so will interrogate [her] about the obstructive conditions in the midst of the twofold saṃgha.' This is the motion.

## Iii.Ii.3.2 Exhortation To Honesty By The Private Instructor Bhikṣu

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. This is your time to tell the truth. This is the right time. I will ask you just a few questions, and you should not be embarrassed, but answer correctly, 'it is,' when something is the case, and 'it is not,' when something is not the case.'

## Iii.Ii.4 Actual Act Of Full Ordination Before The Twofold Saṃgha 275Iii.Ii.4.1 Motion Before The Twofold Saṃgha For Full Ordination

Next, the *bhikṣu* who files the motions (Tib. *gsol ba byed pa'i dge slong*, Skt. jñaptikāraka) should make the [following] motion, and then institute the act:
'Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please listen. This [person] by the name of so-and-so with so-and-so as female preceptor, is seeking full ordination from the twofold *saṃgha*. This [candidate] by the name of so-andso, with so-and-so as female preceptor, requests full ordination from the twofold *saṃgha*. She is a woman, has a female organ, and has reached the age of twelve years in the case of someone living in a household or the age of twenty years as an unmarried woman. She has the five robes and alms bowl.276 The bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* has granted her the two years of training in the six dharmas and the six subordinate *dharma*s, and she has trained for two years in the training of the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s. The bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* has given her the brahmacaryopasthāna*saṃvṛti* by means of the three *dharma*s:
277 The required preliminary acts have been done by the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*, the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* has been pleased with her, and she says that she is free of the obstructive conditions. Therefore, [this candidate] by the name of so-and-so, with so-and-so as female preceptor, requests full ordination from the twofold saṃgha. If the moment is right and the twofold saṃgha agrees to it, may the twofold *saṃgha* grant its permission. May the twofold saṃgha fully ordain [the candidate] by the name of so-and-so, with the female preceptor so-and-so.' This is the motion.

## Iii.Ii.4.2 Proclamation By The Karmakāraka Of The Actual Act (Karmavācanā)

The *karman* should be instituted as follows: 'Venerable members of the twofold saṃgha, please listen. This [person] by the name of so-and-so, with so-and-so as female preceptor, is seeking full ordination from the twofold saṃgha. She is a woman, has a female organ, and has reached the age of twelve years in the case of someone living in a household or the age of twenty years as an unmarried woman. She has the five robes and alms bowl.278 The bhikṣuṇī saṃgha has granted her the two years of training in the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s, and she has trained for two years in the training of the six *dharma*s and the six subordinate *dharma*s. The *bhikṣu*ṇī saṃgha has given her the brahmacaryopasthāna*saṃvṛti* [Skt. by means of the three *dharma*s].

279 The required preliminary acts have been done by the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha*, the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* has been pleased with her, and she also says that she is free of obstructive conditions.

Since [this candidate] by the name of so-and-so, with so-and-so as female preceptor, is requesting full ordination from the twofold saṃgha, those venerables280 who agree to fully ordain this [person] by the name of so-andso, with so-and-so as female preceptor, please remain silent. Those, who do not agree, please speak.' This is the first *karmavācanā*. It should be declared a second and a third time.

## Iii.Ii.4.3 Announcement Of The Resolution

"This [person] by the name of so-and-so, with so-and-so as female preceptor, has been fully ordained by the twofold *saṃgha*. By remaining silent, the twofold saṃgha has agreed and granted its permission. I hereby declare it so."

# Iii.Iii End Of The Act Of Full Ordination (Upasaṃpadā)

## Iii.Iii.1 Measuring The Shadow281

Then the shadow should be measured.

282 The bhik*ṣuṇī*s used a very long [Skt. 

vine283] to measure the shadow. The Bhagavān said, "Do not measure the shadow with a very long vine." When they measured with their feet, 284 the Bhagavān said: "Do not measure with your feet. Take a stick that is four fingerwidths long." This is how a stick that has this specific length came to be called a 'person.'
285

## Iii.Iii.2 Ascertaining The Season286

After that the season should be announced. These are winter, spring, rainy season, the period of shorter rains, 287 and long season. Among these, winter is four months, spring is four months, the rainy season is one month, the period of shorter rains is one day, and the long [rainy] season is three months less the one night [and day of the period of shorter rains].288

## Iii.Iii.3 Ascertaining The Time Of Day289

The time should also be announced. Early dawn, mid-dawn, end of dawn, just before sunrise, sunrise, first eighth of daylight, first quarter of daylight, just before noon, at noon, just after noon, the last quarter of daylight, the last eighth of daylight, just before sunset, at sunset, just before stars appear, starlight, [Skt. and so forth.]
16th of the 1st month to the 15th of the 5th month; 3) summer (rains) season 
(*dbyar gyi dus*, one month) consisting of the 16th day of the 5th month to the 15th day of the 6th month; 4) the so-called "short summer (rains) season" (*dbyar* thung ngu'i dus 1 day) consisting of the 16th day of the 6th month (24 hours), and 5) the "long summer (rains) season" (*dbyar ring po'i dus*, three months less the one day) consisting of the 17th day of the 6th month to the 15th day of the 9th month. See also Härtel (1956: 87), as well as Tsedroen (Monastic Rites 1996: 30), and (1996: 63n89) where in the Preparatory Rite for Agreement on the Summer (Rainy Season) Retreat (*dbyar khas len gyi sbyor ba'i cho ga*) it is announced that "tomorrow," i.e., the next day, the rainy season retreat will be initiated. Here "next day" refers to the 16th day of the 6th month, provided the saṃgha has decided to accept the commitment to engage in an early summer 
(rainy season) retreat (*dbyar snga ma*), which lasts three months. The late summer (rainy season) retreat (*dbyar phyi ma*) starts on the 16th day of the 7th month. The Preparatory Rite for Agreement to Summer Retreat takes place on the 15th day after the *poṣadha* ceremony. See also Wilson (1984–1989: 231– 234) for the Vinaya calendar according to which the MSV divides the year into six seasons. However, as this passage shows, the MSV (also) knows a division into five seasons, which is different from the division into three seasons that is followed by the Theravādins in accordance with the Vedic system. The six seasons are common in the MSV Vinaya rituals practiced in contemporary Tibetan Buddhism.

IV The Four Kinds of Principle Guidelines **to be Observed by** 
Bhikṣuṇīs290

## Iv.I The Three Supports Of Life (Trayo Niśrayāh) 291 Iv.I.1 Introduction

Then the three supports should be announced. 'You, by the name of so-andso, please listen. The Bhagavān, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha, who knows and sees, has taught the following three supports for bhik*ṣuṇī*s who have gone forth and fully ordained. If *bhikṣu*ṇīs rely on these, this is their going forth, full ordination, and bhikṣuṇīhood292 in the wellspoken Dharmavinaya. What are the three?'

## Iv.I.2.1 Niśraya 1293

'Among robes,294 those from a heap of rags are appropriate and easy to obtain. If *bhikṣu*ṇīs rely on these, that would be their bhikṣuṇīhood, going forth, and full ordination in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya. Will you, Venerable, by the name of so-and-so, from today onward for as long as you live, be contented with robes from a rag heap?' She should reply, 'Yes, I will be contented with them.' 'If a surplus is obtained, you may also accept silk, cotton, *prāvāra* cloth, 295 thin or fine cotton, 296 cloth made from hempen plant, 297 raw silk, 298 *āmilā*299 cloth, *somilā* cloth, 300 cloth of dark maroon silk, 301 fine Kāśi 302 cloth, fine linen, 303 fine *dukūla* cloth,304 fine koṭ*ambaka* cloth, 305 and any other appropriate cloth obtained from the saṃgha or from an individual in moderate measure]. Do you fully commit 306 to such a state307?' To this she should reply: 'I fully commit.'

## Iv.I.2.2 Niśraya 2308

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. Among [types of] food, alms food (piṇḍa*pāta*) is appropriate and easy to obtain. If *bhikṣu*ṇīs rely on that, this becomes their bhikṣuṇīhood, going forth, and full ordination in the wellspoken Dharmavinaya. Will you, Venerable, by the name of so-and-so, from today onward for as long as you live, be contented with alms food?' She should reply, 'Yes, I will be contented with it.' 'If a surplus is obtained, you may accept boiled rice, 309 pap, 310 gruel, 311 regularly offered [food],
312 food given away on the feast of the eighth lunar day, 313 food of the fourteenth lunar day, 314 and food of the fifteenth lunar day, (i.e., full moon),
315 and any other appropriate alms food obtained by the saṃgha or by an individual, in moderate measure. Do you fully commit to such a state?' To this she should reply: 'I fully commit.'

## Iv.I.2.3 Niśraya 3316

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. Herbal decoction 317 is appropriate and easy to obtain. If *bhikṣu*ṇīs rely on that, this becomes their bhikṣuṇīhood, going forth, and full ordination in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya.

In India, on the fifth days of certain months in the lunar calendar, such as the *nāga pāñcami*, the custom is to make ritual food offerings, called piṇḍa. The piṇḍa offering is made of dough that is pressed inside one hand and thus has the shape of the five fingers. This can also be understood from the context, because the first three in the Derge list refer to different kinds of food, no. 4–6 refer to invitations to special meals, and no. 9–
12 to special dates. So these listed between the two categories are applicable to both, i.e., to special invitation and specific time.

IV.ii The Eight Infractions Leading to Exclusion from the Saṃgha332

## Iv.Ii.1 Introduction Iv.Ii.1.1 Result Of Making Effort And Engaging In Wrong Conduct

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. The Bhagavān, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha, who knows and sees, has taught the following eight infractions (Tib. *ltung ba'i chos brgyad*, Skt. aṣṭau *patanīyā* dharmāḥ)
333 for *bhikṣu*ṇīs who have gone forth and fully ordained. If a bhik*ṣuṇī* makes effort and engages334 in any of these335 activities, 336 immediately upon making such effort and engaging in it, she will no longer be a bhik*ṣuṇī*. She will no longer be a *śramaṇī*.

337 She will no longer be a daughter of the Śākya (*śākyaputrīyā*).

338 Her bhikṣuṇīhood will be lost. Her [status as a] *śramaṇī* will also be lost. She will be lost, 339 destroyed, 340 fallen, 341 and completely defeated.

342 It will not be possible to reinstate her as a *śramaṇī*.'

# Iv.Ii.2 List Of The Eight Infractions (Patanīyā Dharmāḥ)

## Iv.Ii.2.1 Patanīya-Dharma 1346 Iv.Ii.2.1.1 Wrong Conduct, And Benefit Of Its Abandonment347

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. What are the eight? The Bhagavān has criticized desire348 in many different ways:349 It is grasping; 350 desire is attachment, 351 desire is attraction, 352 desire is [intent on what is] 
346 See above, IV.ii.1.1, p. 244 note 332 and p. 245 note 341, and below p. 261 note 441. Sch 261 MS Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 23 b3 has *patanīyā dharmma* em. *patanīyā* dharma. The term, more common today, *pārājika*, occurs in our Sanskrit text for the first time in IV.ii.2.7 Patanīya-Dharma 7, while in Tibetan, above at IV.ii.1.1, p. 145) ltung ba'i chos brgyad (a*ṣtau patanīyādharmāḥ*) and *phas pham pa* both occur, but there *phas pham pa* translates not the Skt. term *pārājika*, but *parājita,* 
which we have rendered in English as "defeated."
347 Cf. Uj III.ii.2.1.1. 348 Tib. *'dod pa smad pa*, Skt. *kāmā vigarhitā.*
349 The handling of this list in the Tibetan translations of the Bhik*ṣuṇīkarmavācanā* and the Bhik*ṣukarmavācanā* differs in interesting ways. In the Sanskrit equivalents to both, we have a series of compounds all having *kāma* as its first term. The translators of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā* apparently construed these compounds as karma*dhāraya* compounds, that is to say, as appositional. Thus, the Tibetan has *'dod pa ni chags pa'o* | | *'dod pa ni sems pa'o* | | *'dod pa ni sdug* pa'o etc, whereas in the corresponding passage in the Bhik*ṣukarmavācanā*, the same *kāma* compounds were construed by the Tibetan translators as fourth-case tatpuruṣa. Cf. Uj III.ii.2.2.1 'dod pa la zhen pa dang | *'dod pa la 'chums pa dang* | *'dod pa la lhag par zhen pa ni*. There are also notable discrepancies in the terms that comprise the two lists. The Sanskrit of the Bhik*ṣukarmavācanā* contains a subset of those terms appearing in the Bhik*ṣuṇīkarmavācanā* and these same Sanskrit terms are translated differently into Tibetan in the Bhik*ṣukarmavācanā* as compared to the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā*. For the Skt. in the Bhikṣukarma-*vācanā,* cf. Härtel (1956: 80).

350 Tib. *'dzin pa'o*. There does not appear to be Sanskrit equivalent to this term in the list. 

351 Tib. *'dod pa ni chags pa'o*, Mvy 2123 bdag tu chags pa, bdag la chags pa (ātma-*sneha*). BSHD: desire for lust, Mvy 2123 'dod pa la 'dun pa (*kāmacchanda*). Skt. 

differs: *kāmasneha*, Mvy *sneha* 4616 *snum pa'm gsher ba*.

352 Tib. 'dod pa ni sems pa'o. 

attractive, 353 desire is abiding [with the object],
354 desire is fixation, 355 [and]
desire is extreme attachment.

356
'[The Bhagavān] has praised the giving up of desire, 357 [its] abandonment, 358
[its] extinction, 359 the freedom from desire, 360 the rising above it, 361 [its] 
thorough pacification, 362 [and its] cessation.

Therefore, from today onward, you by the name of so-and-so should not gaze at364 a man with attachment in your mind, nor even look at him with attachment, not to mention forming a couple and engaging in non-celibate conduct, that is to say, sexual intercourse.

It is debatable what Sanskrit term the Tibetan is translating here. The Tibetan does not match the order of our Sanskrit manuscript. The uncertainty faced in attempting to map the Tibetan on to the Sanskrit is compounded by the fact that there is a minor text omission in this passage. In some cases, it may be that the Tibetan here is giving a more detailed depiction of what is alluded to in the Sanskrit terms. For example, the Skt. saṃki*likilāyed* (BSHD "making happy noises together") may be glossed here with Tib. *rtse ba'i tshig rtse ba* but the *dregs pa* (below) may also be serving this function, i.e. playing hard to get. 

428 Tib. *lhan cig tu*. Skt. *sārddhaṃ*. Unlike the corresponding phrase in the 5th patanīya*-dharma*, the Sanskrit here includes *sārddhaṃ*. The Tibetan in both cases reads either lhan cig or *lhan cig tu*.

429 Tib. *rtse ba*. Skt. sa*ṃkrīḍ*et.

432 Tib. *rgyug pa*. Here too, it is unclear whether this Tibetan is translating any of the Sanskrit verbs in this list and, if so, which one. Cf. Mvy 4952 rgyug (*dhāvati*); BSHD *dhāvita* - running.

434 Tib. *stan*, Skt. *uddeśa*. Cf. Waldschmidt (1926: 77) which has *yul phyogs*.

Coming as this does in the list of three nouns governed by a single verb ‒ in uddeśaṃ nimittaṃ saṃketaṃ *kūryad* for bstan tam | *dus 'dor ram* | *mtshan ma 'dzugs pa* - it would appear that *dus 'dor* appears to correspond to Skt. *saṃketa*. Cf *'dor ba* in the sense of *rgyab pa* in Jä. However, the missing passage ends with *kṣiped* which could also correspond to *'dor* (ba).

## Iv.Iii The Eight Gurudharmas To Be Observed For Life454 Iv.Iii.1 Introduction

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. The following eight gurudharmas have been taught by the Bhagavān, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha, who knows and sees, for bhik*ṣuṇī*s who have gone forth and fully ordained, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe them for life.

## Iv.Iii.2 List Of The Eight Gurudharmas Iv.Iii.2.1 Gurudharma 1

'What are the eight? You, by the name of so-and-so, after a woman has received the going forth and higher ordination from the *bhikṣu*s, she should understand well that she has attained bhikṣuṇīhood.

455 This, so-and-so, is the first *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.2 Gurudharma 2

'Bhikṣuṇīs should seek the teacher's instruction from the *bhikṣu*s every half month. This, so-and-so, is the second *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.3 Gurudharma 3

Bhikṣuṇīs should not enter rainy-season retreat in a residence where there are no *bhikṣu*s. This, so-and-so, is the third *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.4 Gurudharma 4

When *bhikṣuṇī*s are concluding their stay in the rainy-season retreat, they should perform the *pravāraṇā* in both *saṃgha*s, with regard to three points:
what they have seen, heard, or suspected. This, so-and-so, is the fourth *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.5 Gurudharma 5

When a *bhikṣu* has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle, a *bhikṣuṇī* should not reproach or remind him [of that]. Bhikṣuṇīs are not permitted to reproach or remind a bhikṣu who has failings in his discipline, failings in his view, failings in his behavior, or failings in his lifestyle. However, it is not prohibited for *bhikṣu*s to reproach or remind *bhikṣuṇī*s, who have failings in their discipline, failings in their view, failings in their behavior or failings in their lifestyle. This, soand-so, is the fifth *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.6 Gurudharma 6

A bhik*ṣuṇī* should not revile456 a *bhik*ṣu. She should not antagonize him. She should not upbraid him. 457 It is not permitted for *bhikṣu*ṇīs to revile, antagonize or upbraid a *bhik*ṣu. This, so-and-so, is the sixth *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.

## Iv.Iii.2.7 Gurudharma 7

If a *bhikṣu*ṇī violates a *gurudharma*, she should show respect to both saṃghas for half a month. This, so-and-so, is the seventh *gurudharma* established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.458

## Iv.Iii.2.8 Gurudharma 8

A *bhikṣu*ṇī who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should formally salute a *bhikṣu* who has been fully ordained that very day, praise him, stand up, place her palms together and pay respect. This, so-and-so, is the eighth gurudharma established for women by the Bhagavān, for the sake of containment and to prevent the exceeding [of bounds]. Women should observe it for life.'
459

## Iv.Iii.3 Acceptance Of The Eight Gurudharmas As Practice (Learning Method)

'Will you observe and practice these eight *gurudharma*s?' She should reply, 'I will practice them.'

## Iv.Iv The Four Śramaṇakārakadharmas460 Iv.Iv.1 Introduction

'You by the name of so-and-so, please listen. The following four' … here the passage above (at IV.iii.1) should be inserted up to 'the Samyaksaṃbuddha, who knows and sees.'

## Iv.Iv.2 The Four Qualities That Make A Śramaṇa

'What are the four? You, by the name of so-and-so, from today onward, if someone insults you, do not insult them in return. If someone becomes angry at you, do not become angry in return. If someone beats you, do not beat them in return. If someone derides you, do not deride them in return.

## Iv.V The Concluding Instruction Iv.V.1 Aspiration To Ordain Fulfilled

'You by the name of so-and-so, please listen. Earlier you said: "May I go forth in the well-spoken Dharmavinaya, receive full ordination and bhikṣuṇīhood." You had the wish, and [now you] are fully ordained. You have a female preceptor (*upādhyāyikā*) endowed with ethical discipline,461 two teachers462 endowed with ethical discipline, the [Skt. entire] assembly of the twofold *saṃgha* has instituted the *jñapticaturthakarma*ṇ, which is irreversible and not something to set aside, 463 and thus you have gone forth and become fully ordained.'
244 note 337. Therefore, a reconstruction in Skt. as *catvāraḥ śramaṇī-kārakā dharmāḥ would be conceivable too. As Schmidt (1993: 271 note 388) points out, the supplement is uncertain. But the female form *dg*e sbyong ma du byed pa'i* chos bzhi seems not to be attested in Tibetan. Therefore, a gender-neutral reading is more likely here.

461 Note, no male preceptor (*upādhyāya*) is mentioned. That is the reason that many contemporary Tibetan Vinaya masters are under the impression that women cannot be ordained by monks. According to their studies a *bhik*ṣu upādhyāya*
(Tib. **dge slong ma'i mkhan po*) does not exist.

462 Although the Tibetan has only *slob dpon*, the use of the dual in Sanskrit (*ācāryābhyāṃ*) makes it clear that the reference is to two individuals, presumably an ācārya and an *ācāryikā*. The form leaves indeterminate the gender of the individuals. 

463 Tib. phyir bya ba med pa dang | *gzhag par bya ba med pas*, Skt. akopyena *asthāpanārhena*. The Tibetan preserves the instrumental case for this and the preceding clause, as applied in the Sanskrit, although it renders the Tibetan syntax awkward. 

## Iv.V.2 Explanation Of Equality In Religious Training

'You, by the name of so-and-so, please listen. Anyone who is fully ordained, even if she is a *bhikṣu*ṇī [fully ordained] for a hundred years, will observe the same precepts464 as one who became fully ordained today. The precepts observed by [you] who became fully ordained today, are those that are to be observed by one fully ordained for a hundred years. From today onward, you should please those who [practice] the same discipline as you, who have the same precepts as you, and who recite and read the same *Prātimokṣasūtra* as you. You should not displease them.

## Iv.V.3 Relationship With The Female Preceptor465

From today onward, you by the name of so-and-so, should consider your female preceptor as your mother. The female preceptor will also consider you to be her daughter. From today onward for as long as you live, you should attend your female preceptor [Skt. when she is ill]. As long as she lives, the female preceptor will also attend you [Skt. when you are ill].466

## Iv.V.4 Instruction On Bestowal Of Respect

From today on, you by the name of so-and-so should be reverential and respectful to your teacher (Tib. *bla ma*, Skt. **guru*)
467, your companions in the celibate life,468 your elder sisters (Tib. gnas [b]*rtan ma*, Skt. **sthavirā*),
those on a par, and your juniors. 

## Iv.V.5 Encouraging To Enthusiastic Effort

You by the name of so-and-so, from today on you should receive teachings, 469 read, 470 do recitation, 471 you should become learned in the aggregates 472, learned in the elements, 473 learned in dependent arising, 474 and learned in what is appropriate and what is inappropriate.

475 You should not give up your enthusiastic efforts to achieve what you have not achieved, to master what you have not mastered, and to realize what you have not realized.

## Iv.V.6 Advice For The Time After Ordination

As for these, I have only explained to you the major precepts for training in very broad terms. As for the rest, 476 they are taught by your ordination master, your female preceptor, those who have the same ordination master, those who have the same female preceptor as you, those with whom you can speak, those with whom you can discuss everything, those who are praised, 477 and their friends. Listen every half month to the recitation 478 of the Prātimokṣasūtra.

## Iv.V.7 Concluding Verses

Having been ordained in this way, In the dispensation of the One of Supreme Wisdom, You are now fully ordained.

In this perfect opportunity479 so difficult to attain Do not let your interest wane.

Received the going forth from one who is good, 480 Full ordination from one who is pure. 

Knowing perfectly, 481 this was taught By the Buddha, 482 whose name is the truth, You, by the name of so-and-so, are fully ordained, so practice mindfully.

# 4 Possibilities Of Reviving The Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣuṇī Lineage1

In 2012 by invitation of the Department of Religion and Culture of the Central Tibetan Administration, a "high-level scholarly committee" comprising ten monk scholars ‒ two representatives from each of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and two monk scholars representing the Tibetan Nuns' Project ‒ gathered in Dharamsala to examine the possibility of reviving the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage. 2 Named the 'Tibetan Gelongma Research Committee', this group focused on finding means to ensure that the ordination of nuns be "flawless and perfect" (Tib. nyes med phun sum tshogs pa), in order that nuns in the Tibetan tradition, like monks, will become Mūlasarvāstivādins.

During that meeting in Dharamsala I suggested two ways3to generate this flawless and perfect Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī vow, 1) an ordination by bhikṣus alone based on the first *gurudharma*, and 2) an "ecumenical" ordination by Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s and Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs.

(1) An ordination by bhikṣ*us alone based on the first gurudharma* To evaluate this option, it is important to note that from a historical-critical point of view, the authenticity of the **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu*, especially the eight important rules (Skt. *gurudharma*s, Pā. *garudhamma*s),
4is questionable for a number of reasons. They are rendered differently in the currently accessible Vinaya traditions.

5 These rules subordinate nuns to monks, 6and the acceptance of these rules in itself constitutes Mahāprajāpatī's ordination. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya*, they are pronounced at the end of full ordination (*upasaṃpad*ā) and must be observed as long as one remains a nun (Tsedroen & Anālayo 2013: 758). In the Pāli Vinaya, seven of the eight *garudhamma*s correspond to the *pācittiya* section in the Bhikkhunī*vibha*ṅga. This leads to several inconsistencies. In the Theravāda tradition, for example, the penalties for the transgression of these rules are higher than for the transgression of pā*cittiya* offenses (Hüsken 1997: 350, 356–360). The same goes for the *gurudharma*s in the Chinese *Dharmaguptakavinaya*
(Heirman 1998: 21–22). Hüsken discusses in detail why the eight garudhammas must have been formulated or arranged after the completion of the pā*timokkha* and after the founding of the nuns' order, and thus must be the product of a later historical development (1997: 356–360).

7 For the other Vinayas, Chung (2006) points out that an instruction in the eight gurudharmas at the end of the bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination is surprisingly only recorded in the Vinayas of the Mahīśāsikas and Mūlasarvāstivādins (2006: 
13). Based on this and other observations, he presents a hypothesis that nuns were initially ordained by nuns alone, which was soon prohibited, at which point the eight *gurudharma*s were formulated.8It makes sense that these rules were laid down to prevent women from escaping male dominance or to ensure the traditional protection of women by men (Hüsken 1997: 356; Sponberg 1992: 13 "institutional androcentrism"). It is important to note that Chung, however, does not rule out that a certain number of the eight gurudharmas, in a coherent form, may have indeed been part of Mahāprajāpati's ordination (2006: 14). This implication of a gradual creation process of the eight *gurudharma*s up to their "canonical fixation" as a set of eight gurudharmas could lead to the conclusion that Mahāprajāpati, if she is a historical figure at all, had not been the first, but merely the most famous or authoritative nun in the early order, due to her high status as sister of the queen and foster mother of Siddhārtha Gautama. As such she would have been well accepted by men and women of her time and deemed suitable to become the central character in the narratives establishing the nuns' order.9 O. von Hinüber (2008) takes a different avenue. Based on the Theravāda*vinaya*, he stresses that according to the narration the Buddha himself did not ordain any nun personally but delegated this act from the very beginning to the monks (2008: 5), and argues "that the introduction of the order of nuns was indeed an event at the end of the period of early Buddhism, not too long after the death of the Buddha," i.e., at a time when Mahāprajāpatī, older than the Buddha, had already passed away. He supposes that "the controversy on the admission of nuns might have been ‒ speaking in modern historical terms
‒ between two factions, whether or not to accept a group of female ascetics and their leader" (2008: 27). 

Anālayo (2008), in contrast, rejects hypostatizing the existence of nuns before Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's going forth and opposes von Hinüber's thesis "that the order of nuns appears to have been founded only after the Buddha had passed away" (2008: 110). He considers von Hinüber's approach to containing "methodological shortcomings," because he was "restricting himself to the four Pāli *Nikāya*s" and not taking into account "the range of other discourses that document the existence of the order of nuns during the Buddha's life time" (2008: 122). For a detailed list of works by scholars who have noted inconsistencies with the eight rules, see Anālayo (2011: 301).

Thus, from a historical-critical point of view, it is legitimate to ask whether it is reasonable to base the revival of the *bhikṣu*ṇī order on a text passage such as the eight *gurudharma*s whose authenticity is questionable. From a traditional point of view, however, the respective passage is canonical and considered to be the Word of the Buddha (*buddhavacana*). As such, it cannot be ignored.

The second option I suggested in order to generate a flawless and perfect Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī vow is:
(2) An "ecumenical" ordination by Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣus and Dharmaguptaka bhikṣu*ṇīs* Setting aside the differences about the legal procedures in the Vinaya traditions that were already discussed by Kieffer-Pülz (2010: 219–223) and Heirman (2008), this approach requires a pluralistic view on the Vinaya tradition: It requires us not only to concede that other Vinaya traditions are acceptable but also to give up the claim of one's superiority over the other 
(Schmidt-Leukel 2005). Here I defend such a pluralistic approach, arguing that the claim that one's own Vinaya tradition is superior or that it is the sole legitimate Vinaya is not a sustainable position. I further propose that a pluralistic attitude can be supported by certain passages in the Vinaya itself, to allow one to meet with other Vinaya traditions on an equal footing, "equal with equal," *par cum pari* (Swidler 1987: 15).

The first approach has already been discussed in Tsedroen & Anālayo
(2013), so I will briefly summarize its implications and then concentrate on the second approach, an "ecumenical" *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination by Mūla-sarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s together with Dharmagupta bhik*ṣuṇī*s.

## Tibetan Text And Relevant Sanskrit Fragments

Both approaches are based on the first *gurudharma*10 and are related to the concept of "ordination lineage" in Tibetan Buddhism. This complicates the matter, as we shall see, due to the various perspectives from which one might approach not only the first *gurudharma,* but the *eight gurudharma*s in their entirety, as well as the ordination lineages. Moreover, we need to consider the fact that the *eight gurudharma*s are not only part of the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamī*vastu* (see above chapter 2, I.3.4 and I.3.7), but also of the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* (chapter 3, IV.iii.2). 

Both approaches to ordination are based on the Tibetan translation of the second part of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā* section in the Vinayakṣ*udrakavastu*
('*Dul ba phran tshegs kyi gzhi*), i.e., the Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti,* which corresponds to the respective passages partly preserved in the Sanskrit fragments, ms. c.25(R) of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford,11 as well as on other primary and secondary sources. I rely on the complete Tibetan translation of this text included in this present publication to discuss the implications of my findings for the future of women who practice Tibetan Buddhism and who wish to become fully ordained.

## 4.1 Mūlasarvāstivāda Nuns' Ordination By Bhikṣus Alone

As mentioned in chapter 3.1, the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* contains all stages of a woman's ordination up to the full ordination. 

All the initial stages of ordination are carried out by *bhikṣu*ṇīs alone, up to the point at which the twofold saṃ*gha* is required to perform together the legal act, found at III.ii Karma in the Presence of the Twofold Saṃgha 
(*ubhayasaṃgha*). The actual full ordination requires the presence of a saṃgha of ten *bhikṣu*s. Although there is still mention of a female upādhyāyikā (Tib. *mkhan mo*), she does not play an active role after the bhikṣu saṃgha has joined the *saṃgha* of twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs. Nor is there mention of a bhik*ṣu upādhyāya*. As already discussed above in the introduction to chapter 3, after the *bhik*ṣus have joined the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha
(III.ii.1), the female presiding official (Tib. *las byed pa'i dge slong ma*; Skt. karmakārikā bhikṣuṇī), no longer guides the postulant through the ceremonial rites (III.i.1.1) nor is it her task to declare the *karmavācanā*s. 

Instead, a male presiding official (Tib. *las byed pa'i dge slong pha*; Skt. 

karmakāraka*-bhik*ṣu) takes over that task. At the end of the act of full ordination (III.iii), - that is, after measuring the shade, ascertaining the season and the time of the day or night - the male ritual master announces the four kinds of principle guidelines, which the newly ordained *bhikṣu*ṇīs are to observe henceforth (IV), i.e. the three supports of life (Tib. *gnas gsum*, Skt. tr*ayo niśrayāḥ*), the eight infractions (Tib. *phas pham pa brgyad*, Skt. a*ṣṭau patanīyā dharmāḥ* respectively *aṣṭau pārājikā *dharmāḥ*, cf. Mvy 8358), the eight important rules to be respected (Tib. b*la ma'i chos brgyad,* Skt. a*ṣṭau gurudharmāḥ*), and the four principles for a recluse (Tib. *dge* sbyong du byed pa'i *chos bzhi*, Skt. catvāraḥ śramaṇa-kāraka-*dharmāḥ*,
12 Mvy 8708).

Nevertheless, in the JBE article (Vol. 20, 2013) "The *Gurudharma* on Bhikṣuṇī Ordination in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Tradition," together with Bhikkhu Anālayo I have shown that based on the first *gurudharma,* there is clear canonical evidence that, if circumstances so require, *bhikṣu*s can give all stages of women's ordination, starting with the going forth and continuing all the way up to the full ordination. If these steps are performed by Tibetan Mūlsarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s, the newly ordained *bhikṣu*ṇīs would automatically join the Mūlasarvāstivāda lineage.

According to the Tibetan translation based on the Sanskrit Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā*, the first *gurudharma* (IV.iii.2.1) gives the advice that 
"after a woman has received the going forth and higher ordination from the bhikṣus, she should understand well that she has attained bhikṣuṇīhood" (*bud* med kyis dge slong rnams las rab tu byung zhing bsnyen par rdzogs nas dge slong ma'i dngos por 'gyur bar rab tu rtogs par bya'o), while the Sanskrit version reads that "the going forth, higher ordination and *bhikṣu*ṇīhood should be expected by a woman from the bhikṣus" (bhikṣubhyaḥ *śakāsād* evaṃnāmike mātṛgrāmeṇa pravrajyā upasaṃpat bhikṣuṇībhāvaḥ pratikāṃkṣ*itavya*).

13 Tsedroen and Anālayo (2013: 753–760) explain that in the Bhikṣuṇīkarma*vācanā* this first *gurudharma* appears in three different places.14 Here we are mainly concerned with *gurudharma* 1 as it appears in the third place, i.e., at the very end of the instructions for the procedure to be adopted in the full ordination of *bhikṣu*ṇī. Although the wording is almost the same in all three places, here however, due to the placement of the *gurudharma* at the end of the manual for the bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination rite, the legal implications are different. The wording in the Chinese translation of the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* in the first two places is almost the same: "The *bhikṣu*ṇīs should seek from the *bhikṣu*s the going forth and the full ordination, the becoming of a bhikṣuṇī." T. 1451 (24) 351a1: 諸苾芻尼當從苾芻求出家, 受近圓, 成苾芻尼 性 (repeated again at T. 1451 (24) 351b21).15

## The Dilemma: The Eight Gurudharmas

In the context of the first approach of nuns' ordination, however, we are only concerned with the third kind of principle guidelines to be observed by a bhikṣuṇī: the eight important rules to be respected, i.e., the eight gurudharmas. As explained above, the dilemma posed by that kind of guideline is that from a historical point of view the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas is highly questionable. According to the traditions, however, they are canonical and appear in all Vinayas (Chung 1999; Dhammadinnā 2016: 98). 

From a gender perspective, the question whether the eight *gurudharma*s were established to protect women or to entrench men's power over them, is irrelevant today. At present, the rules are largely experienced as discriminatory16 because they subordinate the nuns to the monks and do so 
 
for no good reason. Women unattached to a male figure are no longer considered to be in a dangerous position of vulnerability, and therefore there is no ground to justify placing them under paternalistic "protection."
In the *Dharmaguptakavinaya* tradition, however, the eight *gurudharma*s still carry weight. Even today, many Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs recite them at the end of their bimonthly confession ceremonies (Skt. *poṣadha*, Chin. 

busa, Tib. *gso sbyong*). Some contemporary Taiwanese Buddhist feminists have been the first to demand their abolition. The most dramatic attempt documented comes from the Taiwanese nun Ven. Chao Hwei. In 2001, during the opening ceremony of a conference Chao Hwei first read the eight gurudharmas out and then tore them up. As Elise DeVido (2010: 107) points out, together with her disciples, Chao Hwei supports "efforts by the government and NGOs to work toward gender equality in Taiwan."
From a Vinaya legal perspective the eight *gurudharma*s are canonical, promulgated by the Buddha himself. This implies that the Buddha ‒ as depicted in the Vinaya ‒ discriminated against women. When the bhik*ṣuṇī* saṃgha had grown in number, Mahāprajāpatī requested the Buddha to revise the *gurudharma* 8, which stipulates that even if a bhik*ṣuṇī* has been fully ordained for a hundred years, she should formally salute a *bhikṣu* who has been fully ordained that very day, praise him, stand up, place her palms together, and pay respect (see Chapter 3, IV.iii.2.8). Mahāprajāpatī requested the Buddha to replace this with the principle of seniority regardless of gender. 

The Buddha refused, explaining that adherents of non-Buddhist sects would not greet women at all.

17 From an academic theologian's point of view, this reason given by the Buddha seems to leave room for contextual interpretation. The Buddha did not reject the request of Mahāprajāpatī in principle, but referred to the social context, to the customs of his time, which did not allow monastic men to show respect to monastic women. That being the case, because today the customs are quite the opposite and mutual respect is required, the rule should therefore be interpreted accordingly to reflect the spirit in which it was first established by the Buddha. Actually, in contemporary Buddhist communities of all three main strands of Buddhism, we already find examples of change in the daily practices of local communities, with *bhikṣu*s in some cases asking senior *bhikṣu*ṇīs to go first or bowing to them in return.

In the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition the eight *gurudharma*s, however, are indispensable to revive the bhik*ṣuṇī* order. According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya*, for the sake of completeness, the *gurudharma*s must be announced at the end of the ceremonial upasa*ṃpadā* rite. From this, we can infer that as long as there were Mūlasarvāstivāda bhik*ṣuṇī*s, perhaps up to the 11th or 12th century (Skilling 1993–1994: 32–40), it was the custom that at the end of each full ordination ceremony a male karmakāraka*-bhikṣu* instructed the newly ordained bhik*ṣuṇī*s to observe the eight *gurudharma*s henceforth. In other words, the nuns were not only taught to acknowledge the principle that *bhikṣu*s is paramount but also to accept that bhik*ṣuṇī*s should receive their ordination from *bhikṣu*s (Tsedroen & Anālayo 2013: 758–759). 

Based on this, as mentioned above, if circumstances so require, *bhikṣu*s can give all stages of women's ordination. Thus, for the revival of the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī order, the first *gurudharma* is essential. It is the key to solving the problem of how to revive the bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition.

In the context of the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya*, in the first of the eight gurudharmas, neither the need of a twofold saṃgha for full ordination is mentioned nor the need to observe a probationary period. This reading appears to present a very early formulation of this *gurudharma*, when the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha had not come into existence yet. For further details, see Tsedroen & Anālayo (2013) and Jyväsjärvi (2011: 193).18 Furthermore, unlike the Pāli Vinaya, 19 the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* tells us that not only Mahāprajāpatī but also the 500 Śākya women20 attending her received the full ordination by accepting the eight *gurudharma*s (Tsering 2010: 164). From a legal perspective an ordination through accepting the eight *gurudharma*s is considered an "ancient rite," Tib. *sngon gyi cho ga,* Skt. purākalpa (cf. Mvy 9281), and such "ancient rites" cannot be employed for present-day ordination.21 But ‒ and this is very important to note ‒ the eight gurudharmas also became a part of the "current rite," Tib. *da ltar byung ba'i* cho ga, Skt. *vartamānakalpa*, which can or even must be applied for present-day ordination because it is the "law" that is currently in effect. As such, it must be observed. The eight *gurudharma*s are an integral part of the current valid gradual ordination manual and therefore *gurudharma* 1 remains a valid permission (Tib. *gnang ba*) or prescription (Tib. *sgrub pa*) for women to receive the going forth and the full ordination from *bhikṣu*s when no community of *bhikṣu*ṇīs exists. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* there is no prohibition (Tib. *dgag pa*) of ordination by *bhik*ṣus alone (cf. Tsedroen & 
Anālayo 2013: 760). This means that in accord with the four great authorities 
(Tib. *cher ston pa bzhi*, Skt. catur*mahāpadeśa*) there is space for interpretation.

22 The Buddha has not explicitly prohibited full ordination by bhikṣus, and such ordination further conforms with what is allowable, i.e., that *bhik*ṣus are allowed to give full ordination when no bhik*ṣuṇī*s are available.

## 4.2 Ecumenical Ordination By Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣus And Dharmaguptaka Bhikṣuṇīs

In turning our attention to the second approach, we can reasonably ask: Are Tibetan Buddhists in a situation in which there is no bhikṣuṇī saṃgha? If you ask that question with regard to the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda context only, the answer could be either: Yes, it is the case that a Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī saṃgha does not exist; the lineage is broken. Or it could be: No, although a Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī saṃgha does not exist right now, the lineage is not broken ‒ it exists latently, because the monk order exists ‒ and thus the Mūlasarvāstivāda *prātimokṣ*a vow lineage (Tib. *so sor thar pa'i sdom* rgyun/ sdom brgyud) is still there, and thus the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha can be revived.23 Accepting this second answer, the next question would be, how can it be revived; by *bhikṣu*s alone as per the approach summarized above, or by an ecumenical ordination, which we will consider now.

At the time of the Buddha, different Vinaya schools had not yet emerged. 

Therefore, canonical texts do not cover how to deal with a community of Buddhist *bhikṣu*ṇīs existing outside the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* tradition. 

Today there is a vibrant tradition of East Asian Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs and with their help the Theravāda bhikkhunī *saṃgha* has been revived 
(Anālayo 2013).

The Tibetan Kanjur neither uses the term "divisions between denominations" (Tib. *sde pa tha dad*, Skt. *nikāyabheda*)
24 nor the term "other schools" bu), continues with Prince Rāhula (Sras sGra gcan 'dzin), Braḥmin Rāhula (Bram ze sGra gcan 'dzin), Patron Nāgārjuna (mGon po Klu sgrub, ca. 150–250 CE), 
Bhāvaviveka (Legs ldan 'byed; 6th cent.), Śrīgupta (dPal sbas), Jñānagarbha (Ye shes snying po), Upādhyāya Śāntarakṣita (mKhan chen Zhi ba 'tsho, 725–788) 
and then continues in more detail, generation by generation with a list of Tibetan Upādhyāyas. In 1954 the 14th Dalai Lama was ordained by his teacher Kyabje Ling Rinpoche (1903-1983), who himself had been ordained in 1923 by the 13th Dalai Lama Thub bstan rgya mtsho (1976-1933). For details see: Thub bstan rgya mtsho, Dalai Lama XIII, *rGyal kun spyi gzugs yongs 'dzin chos bzhin du* spyod pa du ma'i zhal snga nas dam pa'i chos kyi dbang khrid lung sogs mdo sngags zab rgyas bdud rtsi'i rgyun khungs ldan byin rlabs kyi tshan kha ma nyams pa'i bgo skal ji snyed thob pa'i rim brgyud (gSan yig), vol. ni, 212 ff. in vol. 5 of the 7 vol. Lhasa New Zhol edition of the Collected Works (rGyal ba thub bstan rgya mtsho'i gsung 'bum), 4a7-4b7. See also Tsedroen (2008).

24 The author prefers to avoid the translation of *nikāyabheda* as "split of the nikāya", because it has the negative connotation of saṃ*ghabheda*. In general, the term *nikāya* is ambigious. Here it means group, division, school, or denomination. I follow the suggestion by Heinz Bechert to translate '*nikāya*' with 'denomination': "These groupings within the Saṅgha are named in Sanskrit and Pāli as *nikāya*, but the translation 'sect' is hardly adequate ... I rather prefer using the term 'denomination'" (2001:10). The Tibetan tradition seems to link the term "*nikāyabheda*" mainly with Bhāvaviveka's respectively Bhavya's Nikāyabhedavibhaṅga*vyākhyā*na, which provides important information on the early sectarian movement in Indian Buddhism (for more details see Nattier & 
Prebish 1977). But the term *nikāya* cannot be limited to the eighteen schools, and not all of these eighteen schools have bequeathed canonical texts including a Vinaya textual corpus. In its later development, in a Vinaya context, *nikāya* refers not only to Vinaya school but also to the various branches of the order or monastery associations in the *saṃgha* (e.g., Thailand, Sri Lanka, Tibet) due to the different ordination successions or lineages within these Vinaya schools. For 
(Tib. *sde pa gzhan dag*, Skt. *nikāyāntariyā*, Mvy 5149). According to Bechert, we also do not find the term *nikāya* in the canonical Vinayapiṭaka. Separate saṃghas "could make different decisions, but in each instance unanimously within their own *sīmā* or 'boundary'. This situation is not considered a 'split in the Order' (saṅ*ghabheda*), but a *nikāyabheda*, i.e., the formation of separate 'groups' (*nikāya*) of monks" (2001: 12).

The first split within the early Buddhist community is said to have occurred between the Sthaviras and the Mahāsaṅghikas in 116 after the death of the Buddha (Nattier & Prebish 1977: 272). The cause of the initial schism in Buddhist history pertained to matters of Vinaya. Although there is remarkable agreement in all the schools' categories of offenses listed in the basic monastic disciplinary text, that is, the *Prātimokṣasūtra*, one can find diversity in the minor pāyantika*-dharma* and śaikṣ*a-dharm*a sections which do not come under any penal section (1977: 268-269). Different source texts date the first schism by several centuries, i.e., between about one hundred years after the death of the Buddha and the mid-third century B.C.E. (Cox 2004: 502) under the auspices of King Aśoka.25 Scholars assume that the the Theravāda, especially Heinz Bechert (2001), has done intensive research on the different *nikāya*s. For the Tibetan tradition see, for example, Seyfort Ruegg 
(1985) and Heimbel (2013). In Tibetan Buddhism, in a Vinaya context, *sde* or sde pa (*nikāya*) does not refer solely to the eighteen schools (*sde pa bco brgyad*) of Indian Buddhism, but also to different Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya communities. As Heimbel (2013: 213), points out: "Among the four teaching transmissions that Śākyaśrī is acknowledged to have introduced to Tibet, it was his Vinaya tradition that became embodied by the Jo gdan tshogs sde bzhi. His monastic ordination lineage in particular was passed down through the abbots of these four communities and thereby found its way into different schools of Tibetan Buddhism." Also for Buddhism in general, Lokānanda (2016: 181) suggests 
"that there were merely, indeed, a series of *bheda*s (separation) within the Buddhist monastic system, fraternity-style splits or pupillary successions. 

Nikāyas (sects) eventually gave birth to nikāy*abheda*s (sectarianism) due to certain precursorial and prototypical activities of the monastics - a perspective that counters the *saṅghabheda* (schism) long believed in by Buddhologists."
25 For the various lists of Buddhist schools of Indian Buddhism and their subdivisions see Lamotte (1958: 590–597). The opinion of contemporary scholars, whether the Nikāyas of Śrāvakas were philosophical-dogmatic schools or rather schools or orders with a certain Vinaya tradition, goes apart. Agreement seems to exist however in the fact that a splitting up into different Nikāyas 
(*nikāyabheda*) is not to be equated with saṃ*ghabheda* (or sa*ṃgharāji*), nikāyabheda is not an offence (Seyfort Ruegg 1985: 111-112).

earliest distinct Buddhist groups emerged through differences in ordination lineages and Vinaya. Traditional sources maintain the fragmentation of the monastic community after this initial schism into eighteen schools. Chinese pilgrims reported that monks of different doctrinal persuasion resided together, unified by the same ordination lineage and Vinaya. But "relations even among schools distinguished on the basis of monastic disciplinary code were generally not hostile" (Cox 2004: 503). Lokānanda "examines how the nikāyabheda (sectarianism) begun and wherein lies the root, since there was no saṅ*ghabheda* (schism), yet many splits were recorded" (2016: 181). He comes to the conclusion that there was "a number of minor, prototypical pupillary successions under the leadership of certain prominent disciples of the Buddha, which later became sectarianism (*nikayabheda*)" (2016: 184).

As Kieffer-Pülz (2010: 218) has pointed out, "a practice of reintroducing monks' ordination from other subgroups within the same tradition is attested in the Theravāda tradition." In Southeast Asia "we meet instances where new Nikāyas originated simply from the fact that a group of monks finds itself so remote from other members of the same Nikāya that mutual supervision of the correctness of legal procedure is no longer guaranteed" (Bechert 2001: 13) Similarly, Jackson (2010) has shown that in ancient Tibet monks who already possessed full ordination "were making special efforts to preserve one or another particularly valued ordination lineage."
Full nun ordination, by contrast, does not yet commonly exist, and to revive it for the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition and to introduce it into Tibetan Buddhism one must search beyond the normal places. What these sources do show for monks in the Tibetan Vinaya tradtition, however, is the legitimacy of going to great trouble with ‒ and even purposefully manipulating ‒ the procedure of ordination for a good reason" (Jackson 2010: 214). The texts analyzed suggest "one's existing full ordination must be formally given up before engaging in a second ordination ceremony" (2010: 214). On the other hand, Martin (2013: 247 note 20; 2016: 288 note 21) points out that the Fifth Dalai Lama received a second ordination in a different Mūlasarvāstivāda lineage without having given up his earlier ordination (Tsedroen 2008: 209– 210). Based on this historical fact, one possibility would be, to follow the example of the Theravādins taking on the challenge through new approaches by applying the da*ḷhīkamma* (Skt. *dṛḍ*hakarman*), a formal act of 
"reinforcement" to permit movement between *nikāya*s (Kieffer-Pülz 2010: 223), after full ordination by Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*s and *bhikṣu*ṇīs.

But regarding the ordination of nuns, contemporary Tibetan Vinaya scholars in general seem to take it for granted that an ordination by a twofold saṃgha requires *bhikṣu*s and *bhikṣu*ṇīs from the same tradition. But since there Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇīs are not available, we need new directions, or as Noritoshi Aramaki put it during the Hamburg Congress 2007: We need to "be creative of new Buddhist cultures on our earth which are respectively unique to each of all cultural traditions" (2007: 3). He rightly asked: "Isn't it now time for us to start our concrete acts toward our contemporary universal or 'ecumenical' Buddhism for the coming ecological age?" (2007: 2–3). 

When it comes to *bhik*ṣu ordination, such an approach could be traced back to the roots, because there are historic and contemporary reports of monastic rites performed by followers of different Vinaya schools.26 So what speaks against making an exception for nuns too?

Especially in today's increasingly pluralistic societies, it is not surprising that the question arises whether Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s can ask Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs to assist in fully ordaining Tibetan Buddhist *śrāmaṇerikā*s, in the absence of Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇīs. If they agree, would the newly ordained bhik*ṣuṇī*s then belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda or to the Dharmaguptaka school? It would be a vain endeavour to look for a ready-made solution for such a modern challenge in the ancient texts, as there is no ready precedent for today's endeavor.

The question of how to revive full ordination for Buddhist nuns emerged in the 1980s. Two major nuns' orders (Theravāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda) had already ceased to exist about 800 to 1,000 years ago. Due to globalization and increasing international contact among Buddhists from all over the world, Theravāda and Tibetan Buddhists became aware that unlike their own traditions, in East Asian Buddhism the Dharmaguptaka nuns' order still existed. Those nuns, however, belong to a different Vinaya school, neither to the Theravāda nor to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school but to the school of the Dharmaguptakas.

Although all the Vinaya traditions trace their roots back to the historical Buddha, the Dharmaguptaka nuns have a different ordination lineage, a different lineage of teachings and practice of the Vinaya. For centuries Vinaya scholars have considered these differences to be significant even if the differences among the schools are minor. Now, why do we care which lineage or Vinaya school the nuns belong to? 

Lineages serve as proof of authenticity. In Tibetan Buddhism lineages are documented by drawing up chronological lists with names of certain key figures, outstanding masters, to ensure ‒ and to prove ‒ that the respective teaching reaches back to the Buddha himself, and is not newly created by Tibetans. To be authentic means to be genuine and credible. 

Dharmaguptaka nuns have existed throughout Buddhist history, but Tibetans as well as Theravādins were not familiar with their origins and history and thus questioned the authenticity of their lineage, especially in the early years of contact with them.

Belonging to a certain Vinaya school is a question of authority. Members of each school take it for granted that only those who belong to "their" school, i.e., those who have received ordination by contemporary holders of one of their Vinaya lineage (and fulfill certain other requirements) are authorized to carry out the different kinds of monastic rites.

The basic requirements to accept disciples and to officiate at monastic rites are 1) to be fully ordained (Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa*, Skt. upasaṃ*panna*) and 2) to have the three virtues of being learned, respectable, and stable (Tib. *mkhas btsun brtan gsum*). This means being learned in the Tripiṭaka, especially in the *Vinaya*, being free from a major offense (Tib. 

pham pa, Skt. *pārājika*) of the monastic code (Tib. *so sor thar pa*, Skt. 

prātimokṣa), and being stable in the practice of Vinaya after having trained with a senior monastic for at least ten/twelve years.27 This is, why although we cannot expect to find an easy solution in ancient texts, the discussion needs to be based on those ancient texts and their proper understanding using our common sense. In other words, contextual hermeneutics needs to be applied.

## 4.2.1 An Argument For The Validity Of An Ecumenical Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

In 2012 in Dharamsala, I introduced the following heuristic hypothesis to the scholars of the Tibetan Gelongma Research Committee:
The flawless and perfect Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī vow can arise when it is given by a Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣu saṃgha together with a Dharmaguptaka bhikṣuṇī saṃgha, because:
1. If two saṃghas apply the current *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination rite, only one vow (Tib. *sdom pa*; Skt. *saṃvara*)
28 arises (that is the bhikṣuṇī vow) wherein the male saṃgha is paramount; 2. Although the generation of the perfect vow depends on many conditions, a *prātimokṣ*a vow arises from its specific substantial cause (Tib. nye bar len pa'*i rgyu,* Skt. *upādānakāraṇ*a) within the continuum of the ordainee. It is not transferred from outside, from the continuum of another person; 3. The school affiliation depends only on the monastic rite (Tib. 

las kyi cho ga, Skt. *karmavidhi*) followed during ordination.

In summary, why do these three premises entail the conclusion that the flawless and perfect vow can arise in this context?

The flawless and perfect *bhikṣu*ṇī vow arises because, firstly, the Mūlasarvāstivāda male saṃgha is necessary and sufficient to make the ordination legitimate. Secondly, because the actual substantial cause of the vow does not depend on the saṃgha conferring the vow but on the person who takes the vow. The cause of the Mūlasarvāstivāda bhik*ṣuṇī* lineage (provided it exists separately from the *bhikṣu* lineage) lies in the person ordained, not in the ordainer (and his/her gender). And thirdly, in contrast to the *bhikṣu* ordination, in the case of the *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination, we can have an ordination performed by a male *saṃgha* of one tradition (e.g. Mūlasarvāstivāda) together with a female *saṃgha* of another tradition (e.g. Dharmaguptaka), 
because *bhikṣu*ṇīs play only a secondary role and are even completely dispensable, if not available. Provided the ritual is performed correctly, it leads to the women ordained becoming members of the monks' (Mūlasarvāstivāda) tradition. They will receive ordination, and the perfect and flawless vow will arise.

The cause of the *bhikṣu*ṇī vow lineage resides within the woman receiving it, and it is the Mūlasarvāstivāda ritual used during the ordination that determines the Vinaya school affiliation. Thus, all that is needed is the presence of the Mūlasarvāstivāda monks as officiants to make the ordination legitimate. Let us consider the bases and implications of these three premises:

## The First Premise

If two saṃghas apply the current *bhikṣuṇī* ordination rite, only one vow (Tib. 

sdom pa, Skt. *saṃvara*) arises (that is the *bhikṣuṇī* vow), wherein the male saṃgha is paramount.

The understanding of lineage from a philosophical point of view: At the heart of this reasoning lies the assumption that the *bhikṣu* and bhik*ṣuṇī* vow are "of a single nature" (Tib. *ngo bo gcig*) or "of a single substance" (Tib. 

rdzas gcig) and that there is only one lineage that counts, i.e., the *prātimokṣ*a vow lineage.

29 In the case of two different30 lineages, a *bhik*ṣu and a *bhikṣu*ṇī one, nuns would be holders of both lineages and obtain both vows, if ordained by two saṃghas. If, on the other hand, the *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage existed independently from the *bhik*ṣu lineage, *bhik*ṣus would not be involved in generating or validating the bhik*ṣuṇī* lineage; it would be sufficient for the ordination to be conferred by *bhikṣu*ṇīs alone.

One argument against the possibility of reviving the Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī order is that the "stream of the *bhikṣu*ṇī vow" (Tib. *dge slong ma'i* sdom rgyun), i.e., the *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination lineage, has already been broken once and for all. Consequently, women would have to wait for the next Buddha. Nuns, however, have always been dependent on *bhikṣu*s since the very beginning. Thus, a *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage is not distinct from the *bhikṣu* lineage, because bhik*ṣuṇī* ordinations never took place without *bhikṣu*s. But they did take place without *bhikṣu*ṇīs throughout Buddhist history, not only at the time of the Buddha (see Anālayo 2015: 413–415), but also when transmitted to China (Heirman 2001), in the later history of the Korean bhik*ṣuṇī*s (I. Chung 2007), and also in the history of the Taiwanese bhik*ṣuṇī*s 
(DeVido 2010: 16). Full ordinations of women are usually performed with the help of senior *bhikṣu*s who are well learned in the Vinaya. A *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination lineage consisting of *bhikṣu*ṇīs alone does not exist. The only stable factor in *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination has always been the participation of bhikṣu *saṃgha*s.

In autumn 2011, when I conducted field research in India, the nuns of Jangchub Choeling Nunnery in Mundgod and the late Ven. Geshe Lobsang Palden (1935–2016) ‒ at that time the abbot of Sera Je Monastery in Bylakuppe ‒ organized two all-day Vinaya symposia in their convents in order to give me the opportunity to discuss the bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination with leading Vinaya scholars of the three main Gelugpa monastic universities.

Over four days, Tibetan nun scholars and I met with more than 20 leading Vinaya scholars from all six colleges of the three main Tibetan Gelugpa monasteries: Sera, Drepung and Ganden.

We wanted to find out how exactly they understood the concept of a bhikṣuṇī lineage. Did Mahāprajāpatī have such a lineage? Another question discussed was the status of those women in India who for centuries were fully ordained by a twofold saṃgha of ten *bhikṣu*s and twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs. Did they obtain one or two vow lineages? Finally we inquired into the status of those first *bhikṣu*ṇīs who in ancient times were ordained by *bhikṣu*s alone ("by means of a *bhikṣu karman*" in Clarke 2010: 235). 

The Vinayottaragrantha ('*Dul ba gzhung dam pa*) states that if a śikṣamāṇā is ordained through the legal act of a *bhikṣu*, she is deemed to have been fully ordained, even though those who fully ordained her committed a minor infraction.

"Venerable, if a probationer (Tib. *dge slob ma*, Skt. *śikṣamāṇā*) is ordained through the legal act of a bhikṣu, is she deemed to have been fully ordained?"
"Upāli, [she] is deemed to have been fully ordained, but those who ordained [her] commit a minor infraction."31 Tibetan: btsun pa dge slob ma dge slong gi las kyis bsnyen par rdzogs par bgyis na bsnyen par rdzogs pa zhes bgyi '*am /* u pā li bsnyen par rdzogs pa zhes bya ste / bsnyen par rdzogs par byed pa rnams ni 'das pa dang bcas pa'*o //*
Does such a *bhikṣu*ṇī have a vow lineage? In Sera, although all scholars were sure that she has a lineage, the Vinaya scholars were in disagreement as to whether it was a *bhik*ṣu or a bhik*ṣuṇī* lineage. Finally, Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup, who had been one of the speakers at the International Congress on Buddhist Women's role in the Saṃgha in 2007, and in 2012 had represented the Tibetan Nuns in the Gelongma committee, said: "Whether the person to be fully ordained obtains the vow or the vow lineage of a bhikṣu or *bhikṣu*ṇī has to be decided from the aspect of whether at the time when the actual vow arises the person to be ordained is a man or a woman. It cannot be decided from the aspect whether the person who gives the ordination is a male or female saṃgha member."32 At the end, all geshes present agreed that this is probably correct. 

This implies that the gender of the conferring party is not the deciding factor. The main cause of the *bhikṣu*ṇī vow and the vow lineage lies in the person to be ordained not in the ordainer.

Monks have always been ordained by monks. Male ordination lineages do not list every monk ordained, and certainly not for the period that the vow was transmitted in India. Rather, the lineages consist of *upadhyāya*s, who became key figures in the transmission of Vinaya through their function as ordination masters. A crucial figure is the first Tibetan monk in each lineage and the name of the *upadhyāya* who ordained him. For India, the Tibetan bhikṣu ordination lineage starts, for example, with the Buddha or his disciple Śāriputra, whereas the Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu* ordination lineage starts with Buddha Śāykamuni or his disciple Upāli.

By contrast, what might a *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination lineage look like? It could start either with Buddha Śākyamuni, if the ordination masters are recorded or, if those who were ordained are recorded, it could start with Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the first Buddhist nun. According to the Pāli Vinaya other women were ordained by *bhikṣu*s alone. But neither the names of those *bhikṣu*s who ordained other women are transmitted nor are the names of those other women. Thus it seems anachronistic and disingenuous to ask contemporary Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs for the record of an exact bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination lineage consisting of bhik*ṣuṇī*s only and reaching back to the Buddha himself to prove the authenticity of their lineage. According to the texts that have come down to us, a full-fledged ordination by *bhikṣu*ṇīs alone never existed.

An exception is the case of Saṃghamittā, daughter of King Aśoka and founder of an order of *bhikkhunī*s in Sri Lanka around 230 B.C.E. Bhikkhunī Dhammapālā is recorded as her *uppajhāyā* and Ayupalā as her *ācāriyā*
(Lamotte 1958: 251).

Similary the Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage is documented in the Pich'*iu-ni chuan-shu,* the *Complete Records of the Biographies of Bhikṣu*ṇīs,33 with the biography of Chu Ching-chien (ca. 292–ca. 361).34 She "received the tonsure [required for all who leave the household life], cast off secular garb, and accepted the ten fundamental precepts from the instructor … Chishan from Kashmir." "There were twenty-four other women of like mind, and together they established Bamboo Grove Convent" at Lo-yang (Tsai 1994: 17–18). In 317 the Kashmiri master Chi-shan returned to Kashmir. 

Forty years later, in the year 357 C.E., Ching-chien and the others, four altogether, became Buddhist nuns by accepting, from the Assembly of monks only, the obligation to observe all the monastic rules. Ching-chien is thus the first of the Buddhist nuns in China" (1994: 19). The ordination of these first four *bhikṣu*ṇīs was given based on "a *karmavācanā* (list of procedures) and of a *prātimokṣ*a (list of rules) of the Mahāsāṃghika School," although there is no evidence of the spread of these works, "the search for disciplinary rules for the bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha (community of nuns) continued . . . An important step for the *bhikṣuṇī-saṃgha* in China was the translation of a Sarvāstivāda bhik*ṣuṇīprātimokṣ*a in 379–380 in Ch'ang-an" (Heirman 2001: 275). 

This shows that in those early times, the lines between the different Vinaya schools were often blurred. The school the ordination masters belonged to is not always clearly mentioned. The texts used for monastic rites may have come from different schools, as such texts were hard to obtain. 

Practitioners were often glad to get hold of any text at all to be able to continue with their practice and the spread of the *dharma.* Otherwise it may have taken years, and life is short.

"The question, however, whether an ordination only held before the bhikṣusaṃgha is valid, remained" (Heirman 2001: 276). There is no mention that these first nuns received the *śikṣamāṇā* precepts [from monks]. Given the context, we have to assume that the ordination procedure applied was the same as for monks, i.e., after going forth and receiving the ten precepts of a novice, which are the same for men and women, four *śrāmaṇerikā*s obtained full ordination (upasa*ṃpadā*) in front of monks alone, and thus the first Chinese bhikṣuṇīsaṃgha was founded.

However, the validity of their *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination, which had been set up by the foreign Buddhist monk T'an-mo-chieh-to 35 in 357 C.E., was challenged by the contemporary Chinese monk Shih Tao-ch'ang (Tsai 1994: 19). Some 70 years later, in 429 C.E. it was further thrown into question by 
"eight nuns from Ceylon" who came to the capital on the foreign boat of captain Nan-t'i from Sri Lanka (Tsai 1994: 53). The nuns stayed at the Luminious Blessing Convent. The doubt they had expressed regarding the validity of previous ordinations was reported to the famous central Asian missionary monk Guṇavarman (367–431) who answered: "The precepts originally arose in the big community. If the original conditions are not fulfilled, this is no hindrance for ordination, as in the case of Gautami [sic, read Gautamī]."36 Three biographies of eminent nuns ‒ Hui-kuo (no. 14; ca. 

364–433), Seng-kuo (no. 27; b. 408), and Pao-hsien (no. 34; 401–477) ‒ deal with the question of whether the first Chinese nuns were truly nuns, and whether the ritual had been carried out in the proper way.

37 The first *bhikṣu*ṇī in China listed in vol. 2 of the *Complete Records of the* Biographies of Bhikṣuṇīs is the Buddhist nun Hui-kuo (ca. 364–433).38 In the year 429, after the Sri Lankan nuns had raised their doubt about the validity of the ordination of the Chinese nuns, "Hui-kuo, Ching-yin and others of Luminious Blessings convent" consulted Guṇavarman about the situation 
(Tsai 1994: 62). One of the questions raised with him was whether "by permitting women to receive the rules from the Assembly of monks only" an offense had been committed (1994: 37). Guṇavarman replies, if they had not been trained [as a *śikṣamāṇā*] for two years, one may speak of an offense. At the same time, however, he makes clear that exceptions are possible, but "the correct view is that, if there is an established assembly present, one cannot but go along with all the requirements." Furthermore, the biography of Sengkuo, a disciple of the nun Hui-ts'ung of Kuang-ling on the north bank of the Yangtze River northeast of the capital tells us that "she herself had a few doubts" too. Therefore, she asked Guṇavarman whether it would be possible to go through the ritual a second time. Thereupon Guṇavarman replied 
"receiving the monastic obligations a second time is of greater benefit than receiving them only once" (1994: 54). 

Finally, about the years 432–434 C.E., 39 Hui-kuo, Seng-kuo, and the others were ordained in Nanking by a *bhikṣu* and a bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* headed by the *bhikṣu* Saṃghavarman, an expert on Abhidharma and Vinaya and successor of the Kashmiri master Guṇavarman and the Sri Lankan senior bhikṣuṇī Devasarā40 (Pā. Tessara 41 or Chin. T'ieh-so-lo42 ). Ann Heirman points out that among other things, Guṇavarman is known for his translation of the *Szu-fen pi-ch'iu-ni chie-mo-fa* (T. 1434), a karma*vācanā* text for nuns of the Dharmaguptaka School, and that therefore S. Lévi and É. Chavannes share the view that Guṇavarman probably advocated an ordination according to the rules of this school (Heirman 2001: 276). 

There is divergence among the accounts of the number of nuns who traveled from Sri Lanka to China. As one story has it, Devasarā had been invited to China with two other senior *bhikṣu*ṇīs, to head the quorum of eight bhikṣuṇīs who had arrived from Sri Lanka some years earlier. Those nuns had not yet attained the right age and lacked the quorum of ten persons. 

Therefore, Guṇavarman advised them to learn the local language.43 After Devasarā and the other two nuns arrived, they performed the *bhikṣu*ṇī reordination as planned by Guṇavarman, who had passed away, before he could do so. The other version reads:
[Four years later] in the tenth year (433), Nan-t'i, the ship captain, brought eleven more nuns from Sri Lanka, including one named Tessara. The first group of nuns, who by this time had become fluent in Chinese, requested Sanghavarman to preside over the ritual for bestowing the monastic rules on women at the ceremonial platform in Southern Grove Monastery. That day more than three hundred women accepted once again the full monastic obligation [this time from both the Assembly of Monks and the Assembly of Nuns]. (Tsai 1994: 54) Thus, the "double ordination" by a bhikṣu *saṃgha* and a bhikṣuṇī *saṃgha* was established in East Asia in approximately 432–434, under the guidance of the *bhikṣu* Saṃghavarman and the *bhikṣu*ṇī Devasarā. This order still exists not only in mainland China, but in Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea, and many other countries as well.

For the Tibetan tradition thus far no detailed records of a Mūlasarvāstivāda śrāmaṇerikā or bhik*ṣuṇī* lineage are known, although there exist individual accounts of *śrāmaṇerikā*s and *bhikṣu*ṇīs in Tibet. 44 Most texts simply refer either to a *mkhan brgyud*, a lineage of [male] *upādhyāya*s, or to a "stream of *prātimokṣ*a vows" (Tib. so sor thar pa'*i sdom rgyun; abbr.* so thar sdom rgyun), i.e., a *prātimokṣ*a vows lineage. Sometimes one also finds the term "bhikṣu *prātimokṣ*a vow lineage" (Tib. dge slong pha'*i so sor thar* pa'i sdom rgyun) or "*bhikṣu* ordination lineages" (Sobisch 2010: 250) but so far I have not encountered any reference to a separate vow lineage of nuns (*bhikṣu*ṇīs), probationary nuns (*śikṣamāṇā*s), novice monks (śrāmaṇ*eras*), 
novice nuns (*śrāmaṇerikā*s), lay men (*upāsaka*s), or lay women (*upāsikā*).45 If the lineage of novices or laity is separate from that of the *bhikṣu*s and was important on its own, one might have expected to find some discussion of it.

This indicates that, on the one hand, the *bhikṣu*s are the authoritative holders of *prātimokṣ*a lineages and, on the other hand, there is a special importance to *prātimokṣ*a, namely in the context of the Three Vows-Theories that is unique to Tibetan Buddhism and central to it.

46 The Three Vows are: 
the *prātimokṣ*a vow (Tib. *so sor thar pa'i sdom pa*),47 the *bodhisattva* vow 
(Tib. *byang chub sems dpa'i sdom pa*), and the mantra vow (Tib. gsang sngags kyi sdom pa). The *prātimokṣ*a vow, also referred to as individual liberation vow, consists of seven types of which the *bhikṣu* vow is considered the superior.

As a Vinaya scholar one may never expect a "separate vow lineage" of śikṣamāṇās, śrāmaṇeras, śrāmaṇerikās, *upāsaka*s, or *upāsikā*s, simply because these people may not be supposed to confer vows upon others. But this is exactly what is disputed among Tibetan scholars, at least nowadays in the living tradition. For there are several well respected and high-ranking Tibetan teachers, who are not (or no more) *bhik*ṣus, though confer all three vows, i.e., *prātimokṣ*a vows (*upāsaka* and *upāsikā* vows), *bodhisattva* vows and *mantra* vows. Furthermore, for centuries, Tibetan *bhikṣu*s confer on women not only *upāsikā*, but also *śrāmaṇerikā* vows. But because monks and nuns are not allowed to live under the same roof, convents have developed where the *śrāmaṇerikā*s are staying on their own, often headed by one monk who is referred to as abbot (*mkhan po*). Tibetan history is unclear on when and by whom the first *śrāmaṇerikā*s became ordained.

Thus, it seems that anyone who has taken at least one of the seven types of individual liberation vows is considered a holder of a *prātimokṣ*a vow but is not necessarily authorized to confer the respective *prātimokṣ*a vows. According to Gelugpa mainstream opinion you have to be a *bhikṣu* or bhikṣuṇī to study and teach the Vinaya, and to confer *prātimokṣ*a vows to others. But it seems to be controversial whether one or the other is authorized to confer all seven types of *prātimokṣ*a vows, and whether a lay person can confer the lay precepts.

If the gender of the person ordaining is not the deciding factor, and if the main cause of the bhik*ṣuṇī* vow and the vow lineage lies in the person to be ordained and not in the ordainer, the answer should be that either a *bhikṣu* or a *bhikṣu*ṇī, could give all seven vows, although this of course is not the usual procedure. Monks and nuns are not supposed to stay under the same roof, but to live separately in male and female communities where they train under two slightly different sets of *prātimokṣ*a rules.

If at some point there were no *bhikṣu*s left, but only *bhikṣu*ṇīs, the question might arise whether nuns would be authorized to ordain *bhikṣu*s in order to restore the *bhikṣu* lineage. This would be more difficult than the other way round because we have no textual evidence for such a case. However, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (Chos mngon pa'*i mdzod kyi bshad pa)* explains that in substance or in essence the vow of a *bhikṣu*ṇī does not differ from that of a *bhikṣu*.

48 This is in line with a famous quote from the *Vinayottaragrantha*, 
in which Upāli asks the Buddha:
"Venerable, if at the time of full ordination [a man] changes sex, is 
[that person] deemed to have been fully ordained?" The Buddha replies: "[That person] is deemed to be ordained. Transfer [her] in the midst of the *bhikṣuṇīs."*
Tibetan:

It is striking, however, that unlike the Pāli source (Vin. III 35, 12–24) that Kieffer-Pülz kindly provided in preparation of the Hamburg Congress 2007 (source: Background / Objectives > Material no. 5 Gender Transformation in the *Vinayapiṭaka* of the Theravadins: https://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/fileadmin/files/GenderTransfor mation3a_01.pdf <(2019–08–26), the Tibetan Kanjur version does not explicitly raise the question as to what happens when a woman changes sex. But perhaps this reverse question was not felt to be important, because from a male perspective when a woman becomes a man, everything is as usual. Kieffer-Pülz (2015–16: 6, note 19) notes (with reference to Hüsken 1997: 66, Kieffer-Pülz 2015: 228 f. and Sujato 2012: 127 note 39) that she is leaving "the sex change rules aside here." For our discussion, however, it is important to note that the 
'Dul ba gzhung dam pa (*Vinayottaragrantha*), D 7 (*'dul ba*), pa, 219a3–6, states: 
"Bhadanta, the Bhagavān said that after a *bhikṣuṇī* has renounced her training, it is not appropriate to grant her once more full ordination to become a *bhikṣuṇī*; 
those who once again grant going forth or full ordination to any [former] 
bhikṣuṇī, come to a minor infraction (Tib. *nyes byas*, Skt. *duṣkṛta*). But in case they grant going forth and full ordination to a *bhikṣuṇī*, after she has renounced her training and descended [from being a *bhikṣuṇī*], even if she is fully ordained, isn't there an offense to those?' The Blessed One said: 'There is. It is like this: If after a *bhikṣuṇī* has renounced her training and descended [from her status as a *bhikṣuṇī*], going forth and full ordination are granted to the one who changed sex, [i.e., to one who is now a man], there is no offense." (*btsun pa | bcom ldan* 
'das kyis dge slong mas bslab pa phul nas | slar dge slong ma'i dngos por bsnyen par rdzogs su mi rung ste | dge slong ma gang dag gis slar rab tu phyung ngam | bsnyen par rdzogs par byas na | de dag nyes pa dang bcas so | | zhes gsungs na | dge slong mas bslab pa phul te babs pa las | de de dag gis rab tu byung zhing bsnyen par rdzogs par bgyis na/ bsnyen par rdzogs pa yang lags la | de dag la yang nongs par mi 'gyur ba mchis sam | bcom ldan 'das kyis bka' stsal pa | yod de | de 'di ltar | dge slong ma de bslab pa phul te babs pa las | de'i mtshan 'phos te mtshan 'phos par gyur pa de | r*ab tu byung zhing bsnyen par rdzogs par byas* na | nyes par mi 'gyur ro). It seems that this statement neither refers to a *bhikṣuṇī* nor to a lay woman, but to one who is now a man, who had formerly been a bhikṣuṇī who renounced the training and left the order, and then changed sex. 

But unlike in the Theravāda tradition, in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition "formal renunciation" does not only exist for monks, but also for nuns (cf. Kieffer-Pülz 2015–2016: 9, 24): *Pārājika* (Tib. *pham pa*) 1, respectively patanīya*-dharma*
(Tib. *phas pham pa*) 1, as announced at the end of the Bhikṣuṇyupa-*saṃpadājñapti*, refers to a *bhikṣuṇī* who neither renounced the training, nor revealed that her training has been weakened (Tib. bslab pa ma phul lam bslab Today all schools of Tibetan Buddhism seem to accept that *prātimokṣ*a vows 
(from their second moment onward) are avijña*ptirūpa* (Tib. *rnam par rig* byed ma yin pa'i gzugs),50 imperceptible form. Whether one becomes a monk or a nun depends on the physical basis (Tib. *lus rten*). The ordination rituals prescribe how the candidate's sexual identity is to be confirmed by examing the reproductive organs (see Chapter 3, II.iii.1.6). After their ordination, monks and nuns are advised to follow one of the two gender-specific monastic codes. Ambiguous gender is seen as an impediment (Tib. bar chad kyi chos, Skt. *āntarāyika dharma*) to ordination.51 If one changes sex, no reordination is required ‒ the person just changes the community (*saṃgha*). 

Why then is a male saṃgha seen as ranking first? On this question the living Tibetan tradition keeps two standard replies ready:
1. The male body is superior; 2. The male saṃgha is senior (Tib. *bslab pa rgan pa*) to the female saṃgha because the *bhikṣu saṃgha* was founded first.

At the time of the Buddha, Buddhist women already questioned this gender-biased hierarchy. Mahāprajāpatī suggested that monks and nuns show respect to each other, regardless of gender.52 The Buddha rejected her appeal making the concession to the expectations of Indian society at that time, that women need to be placed under male authority. Furthermore, ordination by *bhik*ṣus alone is considered valid, although ordination by bhik*ṣuṇī*s alone is considered invalid.53 Thus, at present, *de facto* and *de jure* the *bhikṣu saṃgha* is considered first in rank.

## The Second Premise

Although the generation of the flawless and perfect vow depends on many conditions, a prātimokṣa vow arises from its specific substantial cause (Tib. *nye bar len pa'i rgyu*, Skt. *upādānakāraṇa*) within the continuum of the ordainee. It is not transferred from outside, from another person's continuum.

The formulation of the second premise is standard Tibetan doctrine. Tsongkhapa states in his Essence of the Ocean of Vinaya ('Dul ba rgya mtsho'i snying po)
54 that there are two ways of characterizing the nature of prātimokṣa vows: it is either a kind of form or the continued intention to abandon non-virtue. Form (Tib. *gzugs*, Skt. *rūpa*, Mvy 1859) cannot be substantially caused by mind. Thus renunciation (Tib. nges par '*byung ba*, 
Skt. *niryāta*) can only be the substantial cause of a prāti*mokṣa* vow when accepted as the continued intention to abandon non-virtue.55 Tsonawa Sherab Zangpo (Tib. *Mtsho sna ba Shes rab bzang po*) explains in his '*Dul ba mtsho* ṭīk (ka, 15a1–3) that three kinds of causal motivation (Tib. rgyu'*i kun slong*) 
are needed to generate a *prātimokṣ*a vow: (1) the wish to take it (Tib. *len par* 
'*dod pa*); (2) the understanding that one has attained it (Tib. *'thob par shes* pa); and most importantly; (3) a stable intention to transcend suffering (Tib. mya ngan las 'das pa'i bsam pa brtan po).

56 In this regard he also refers to the *Vinayasūtraṭīkā* where Dharmamitra says that "without a stable intention to transcend suffering the vow will not arise."57 Therefore, Tibetan Buddhist ordination masters emphasize that generating the vow mainly depends on the ordainee's attitude.58 The vow is not something transferred from outside; it does not come, for example, from the preceptor's continuum. Rather, the main cause that generates the vow ‒ whilst depending on many other causes and conditions ‒ is renunciation.

## The Third Premise

The school affiliation depends on the monastic rite (Tib. las kyi cho ga, Skt. *karmavidhi*) followed during ordination.

The third premise is based on the assumption that there are many inner and outer causes and conditions of the generation of flawless and perfect prāti*mokṣa* vows. What makes one specifically a Mūlasarvāstivāda nun is the fact that one was ordained according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda monastic rite. There are many essential elements required for full ordination, which are explained in the monastic rites for *bhikṣu* and bhik*ṣuṇī* ordination.59 Tsonawa concludes that there are seven differences between the *bhik*ṣu and *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination ritual.60 Neither the *bhikṣu* nor the *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination ritual explicitly states that the ten *bhikṣu*s or twelve *bhikṣu*ṇīs have to belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school. 

So, today, in a multi-ethnic and multicultural society, the question is whether in exceptional cases "visiting *bhik*ṣus" (Tib. *glo bur du 'ongs pa,*61 Skt. *āgantuka*, Mvy 8746), or respectively visiting *bhikṣu*ṇīs from a different Vinaya school could step in to assist in ordination, if the required number of resident monastics is insufficient. 62 The Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* distinguishes between one who belongs to a different communion (Tib. *tha* dad [du] gnas pa */ so sor gnas pa*, Skt. nānāsaṃvā*sika*/~kā; cf. Mvy 8757) 
and one who belongs to the same communion (Tib. *gzhi mthun par gnas pa*, Skt. *samānasaṃvāsika*).

63 Monks who belongs to the same communion can be either, resident monks (Tib. *gnyug mar gnas pa*, Skt. *naivāsika*, Mvy 8745) 
or visiting monks (Tib. *glo bur du 'ongs pa*, Skt. *āgantuka*, Mvy 6937). An early 15th century Tibetan monastic constitution differentiates between two remains in his/her position, he/she will never have anything to do with it again. Härtel (1956: 79 note 6) adds that this term refers to a person under suspension, someone who has committed a sa*ṃghāvaśeṣ*a offense (Tib. *lhag ma*) and undergoes *mānāpya* respectively *parivāsa* (Tib*. spo ba*, Mvy 8649). Only a monk who has committed a sa*ṃghāvaśeṣ*a offence and has been dealt with by the community can undergo the probation or *mānāpya*. This presupposes that the monk who committed the offence acknowledges it. If a monk does not acknowledge having committed an offence he can be suspended by the community. Thus, the two things mentioned above do not go together. Either a monk does not acknowledge his offence and is suspended, and thus is a nānāsaṃvāsaka, or he acknowledges his offences, and is then dealt with according to the rules, then he is not a *nānasaṃvāsika*. To be a nānāsa*ṃvāsikā* is also one of the impediments, i.e., an obstructive condition for ordination. In relation to women the Sanskrit term *nānāsamvāsikā* is translated as so sor gnas pa in Tibetan. See Chapter 3 in this volume, III.i.1.3.2, question 35, Kanjur D 6 (*'dul ba*), da, 109a7, Sch 253 Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 16 b2. Bhikṣuṇī*vinayavibhaṅga* Kanjur D 5 (*'dul ba*), ta, 133a2–3: "*tha dad du gnas pa de dag la zhes bya ba ni* so sor gnas pa la'o." Hu-von Hinüber (1994: 369) understands the term nānāsaṃvāsika as "zeitweilig aus dem Orden ausgeschlossen" (suspended from the order) as distinct from asa*ṃvāsika* (Tib. mi gnas pa | *gnas par mi bya pa*, Mvy 8758), "gänzlich aus dem Orden ausgeschlossen" (entirely expelled from the order) (369 note 9). Kieffer-Pülz (1992: 53) points out that according to 
(later) traditional Theravāda*vinaya* interpretation, *nānāsaṃvāsika* also refers to somebody who [due to a different Vinaya interpretation] opted out of a legal community. Every Theravāda monk considers himself samānasa*ṃvāsika* in regard to his own legal community, whereas he considers monks of other legal communities as *nānāsaṃvāsika*. However, it seems that in contemporary Thera-vāda practice, there are various understandings of the meaning of the respective terms (samāna)*saṃvāsika* (Tib. gzhi mthun par gnas pa), asa*ṃvāsika* (Tib. mi gnas pa / *gnas par mi bya pa*) and nānāsa*ṃvāsika* (Tib. *tha dad du gnas pa* / so sor gnas pa). Clarke (2009: 124) questions that asa*ṃvāsa* is equialvent to 'expulsion.' He discusses three terms from a list in the Upāliparip*ṛcchā*, part of the *Uttaragrantha* of the MSV: 1. asaṃvāsika (*mi gnas pa*), 2. one who is in communion elsewhere (nānāsaṃvāsika; *so sor gnas pa*), and 3. one who has previously committed a [grave] offence (*sngar nyes pa byung ba*). These terms, their various definitions these terms have changed in earlier and later times in India as well as in Tibet need further research. Cf. below p. 310 note 73 and 74.

different kinds of students or monks: gzhi pa (*āvāsika*64) - present, resident as opposed to *byes pa* - foreign, non-residents, i.e., traveler, visitor.

65 In ancient Tibet as well as today in Tibetan monasteries in Indian exile, it is very common that monks of the same or from other Vinaya schools, e.g. from India, Mongolia, China, and today also from Taiwan and Korea, are visiting monasteries for many years. How to behave correctly when visiting foreign monasteries is part of monastic training in all traditions and rooted in the Vinaya itself. For example, in the *Poṣadhavastu*, D 1 ('*dul ba*), ka, 148b4–5, Upāli asks the Buddha:66
"Venerable, if resident monks hear that visiting monks, skilled in Sūtra, skilled in Vinaya, and skilled in Mātṛkā 67 are coming, how should they behave toward these [visiting scholars]?"

And the Buddha replies:

[a distance of] up to two and a half *yojanas* 68 to receive them with umbrellas (Skt. *chatra*), victory banners (Skt. *dhvaja*), and flags (Skt. patākā)."

This could be interpreted as a clear advice to practice hospitality69 and to show respect to visiting monks.70 Today, for example, leading senior Dharmaguptaka nuns, skilled in the Tripiṭaka and experienced in functioning as ordination masters in Taiwan, have offered to come to India to conduct śikṣamāṇā ordination for Mūlasarvāstivāda śrāmaṇerikās. They even offered to follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda *śiksamāṇā* rite rather than the Dharmaguptaka rite because the former rite also exists in Chinese translation, and a comparison of the Mūlasarvāstivāda *śikṣamāṇā* precepts with their Dharmaguptaka bhik*ṣuṇī* precepts has shown that they keep all the precepts of the former. The question is whether this kind offer can be accepted in order to revive the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī order?

In 2012, during my meeting with the Vinaya research committee in Dharamsala, I voiced the opinion that in general it should be possible for Dharmaguptaka bhik*ṣuṇī*s to assist during full ordinations. Although there are minor differences between the various Vinayapiṭakas, I think that there is no difference regarding the nature of the vows (Tib. *sdom pa*, Skt. saṃ*vara*) 
 
of the followers of different Vinaya traditions. As shown using the example of gender reassignment, the *bhikṣu* and *bhikṣu*ṇī vows are of the same nature or substance. Otherwise a person who has undergone a change of sex would need to be newly ordained. On the basis of this, I argue that the nature of the vows of Buddhist monks and nuns of different Vinaya traditions are comparable. 71 Obviously, different Vinayas have developed their traditionspecific characteristics, but in essence all of them reach back to the same source, which is the Buddha himself and the first monastic community. For the Buddha, the most important thing seems to have been that his followers live in concord and support one another.

School affiliation mainly depends on place, time, language, and the preceptors (Tib. mkhan po, Skt. *upādhyāya*) along with the instructors (Tib. 

slob dpon, Skt. *ācārya*).72 But following a different Vinaya school does not necessarily imply discord with other schools. This does not refer to discord in the sense of a friction, but to the traditional convention that followers of different monastic codes cannot legally perform any ecclesiastic act together that is then recognized as valid by the members of their respective schools. 

Traditionally it would be considered a "mix" of two Vinaya traditions (cf. 

Hüsken & Kieffer-Pülz 263). 

But followers of different traditions may also be in concord, which is one of the basic conditions for the validity of a Buddhist monastic legal act and was an overarching Buddhist principle right from the beginning. According na | dge tshul gyi slob dpon dang | gsang ste *ston pa dang | las byed pa dang | gnas* sbyin pa'i slob dpon dang | klog pa'i slob dpon no || ... mkhan po gnyis gang zhe na | rab tu 'byin par byed pa gang yin pa dang | bsnyen par rdzogs par byed pa gang yin pa'o." See also Mvy 8727, 8728, 8729, 8730, 8731, and 8732. A 
definition for the *upādhyāyikā* (Tib. *mkhan mo*) is given in the Bhikṣuṇīvinaya-*vibhaṅga*, Kanjur (Dge slong ma'i 'dul bar rnam par '*byed pa*) D 5 ('dul ba), ta, 249a6: "mkhan mo ni | tshul khrims dang ldan pa mang du thos pa yin no" (*upādhyāyikā*: somebody endowed with ethical discipline and very learned). The female term *ācāryikā* (Tib. *slob dpon ma*) occurs in the *bhikṣuṇī* ordination manual but is not further explained. At the suggestion of Petra Kieffer-Pülz, I 
undertook to read all those passages in the Tibetan version of the *Bhikṣuṇīvinayavibhaṅga* (Kanjur D 5, Dpe vol. 9, Tib. *Dge slong ma'i 'dul bar rnam par* 
'byed pa) that relate to the various stages of Buddhist women's ordination, to find more details on the role of the *upādhyāyikā*. This turned out to be a very difficult and time-consuming task, because especially in the field of the 180 expiation-offenses (Tib. *ltung byed kyi chos*, Skt. *pāyattikadharma*), the Bhikṣuṇīprātimokṣasūtra (Kanjur D 4, Dpe vol. 9, Tib. *Dge slong ma'i so sor* tha*r pa'i mdo*) and the *Vibhaṅga* do not match. For a long time, it was questioned whether the *Bhikṣuṇīvinayavibhaṅga* belongs to the Mūlasarvāstivādins at all, cf. Claus Vogel (1985), Tsedroen (1992: 56). But as Shayne Clarke reported during the Numata Conference "Buddhist Nuns in India" (2011), we seem to be confronted with two or even three different regional branches of the *Mūlasarvāstivādin*s. For more details, see Clarke (2018). A table of concordance of the respective rules that need to be considered in this context has been published by Kishino (2015: 185). In summary, I have to admit, that upon initial review, I could not find any helpful hints to clarify the exact role of the *upadhyāyikā* beyond what has been shown in the study above. One would need to study the canonical texts along with the respective Vinaya commentaries which appear in the Tanjur and later Tibetan Vinaya commentaries. And that would be a new research project in itself.

to the Tibetan Vinaya, a saṃgha in concord (Tib. *dge 'dun mthun pa* 73, Skt. 

samagra-saṃgha) is defined as a chapter (Tib. sde, Skt. **nikāya*) consisting of four or more monks agreeing in view and behavior.74 Thus, the question in today's context is whether and how *saṃgha*s of different *nikāya*s of different Vinaya schools could agree in view and behavior, and thus could carry out a valid ecclestical act together. As Lamotte (1958: 518–519) has shown, Nikāyas do not necessarily orginate as the result of schism. ... 

Generally, there was no violent opposition between the adapts of the various sects. They all considered one another as disciples of the Śākya, enjoying the same rights and prerogatives. … Relations were cordial and easy between the members of the different sects: a *bhikṣu* on his travels had the right to stay at Buddhist establishments he encountered on his journey; he was certain to be welcome as a guest and treated according to the rules of monastic courtesy, and no one would ask him for his personal opinions. … The formation of the sects was due mainly to the geographical extension of the community over the entire Indian territory.

What we have seen is that, in general, people from one *nikāya* are not forbidden to participate in the ordination of someone from another *nikāya*. We have also seen that the Buddha explicitly advised showing respect to visiting monks from other *nikāya*s, which tells us that there can be interaction between *nikāya*s. The next question would be whether ecumenical ordination could be one such possible interaction. I will argue that in exceptional cases, if there is good reason, it is not only admissible but even the duty of *nikāya*s of different Vinaya schools to cooperate with and support each other.

## 4.2.2 Recapitulating The Second Approach (Ecumenical Ordination)

In summary, the flawless and perfect *bhikṣu*ṇī vow can be generated by the second approach for the following reasons:
1. Because the *bhikṣu saṃgha* is considered first in rank and because whether one obtains the bhikṣu or *bhikṣu*ṇī vow does not depend on the gender of those conducting the ordination rite but on the gender of the person who receives the vow. Although the lineage of the nuns is that of the monks, due to legal regulations, full ordination should not be given by monks alone, unless there is reason for an exception; 2. Because whether or not the vow arises depends mainly on the attitude of the candidate, i.e., from their wish to receive it, the understanding that one has attained it, and most importantly, a stable attitude of renunciation; 3. Because becoming (or not) a Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī depends on whether or not the *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination rite (Skt. bhikṣuṇyupasaṃ-padā*jñapti*) is that of the Mūlasarvāstivāda school and whether the minimum of three leading75 monks joining the nuns' community for the full ordination belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda saṃgha.

Because all Vinaya traditions trace their roots back to the historical Buddha, it should be safe to assume that the ordination lineages of different schools are of a single nature or substance. It follows that under present circumstances it would be appropriate for monastics of other Vinaya traditions to step in and complement the resident *saṃgha* for the sake of performing a saṃgha act. Before an ecumenical ordination could take place, however, it would be necessary to reach agreements on how to proceed and ensure that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the process and of the precise purpose of this saṃgha act. Because different *Vinaya* schools would be involved and in order to uphold each and every tradition, such questions would need to be raised in intensive dialogues, discussed and answered prior to proceeding with the ordination. Coming together in such a constellation would only be required once in order to revive the Buddhist nuns' order of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition.

As already mentioned, such an approach would require a pluralistic view. 

It would not suffice merely to concede that other Vinaya traditions have value. Any claim for superiority of one's own Vinaya tradition would have to be renounced and one would have to meet with other traditions on an equal footing. If an ecumenical ordination is conducted and both the monastic rite and the bhikṣ*u saṃgha* are Mūlasarvāstivāda, and the accompanying Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu* and bhikṣuṇī saṃgha agree,76 in my view, a perfect Mūlasarvāstivāda vow would arise, depending on the Vinaya hermeneutics applied, i.e., on the way how practitioners interpret and apply the Vinaya in contemporary circumstances in relation to a matter not discussed at the time of the Buddha, because different *Vinaya* schools seem not to have existed at his time.77

## 4.2.3 Further Rules And Regulations To Be Considered

From a *Vinaya* legal point of view, however, the issue is even more complicated. Although this is not explained in the ordination rite itself, according to the *Karmavastu*, the *Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya* section "Formal Act Matters," participants are subjected to several rules and regulations that must be complied with in order to execute a valid *saṃghakarman*.

78 For example, the preparation of saṃ*ghakarman*s always begins with sprinkling the place with water, sweeping the place, arranging the seats, and so forth. The monastic community is summoned by the sound of striking a gaṇḍī wood, the questions to be answered are submitted, and so forth. The most important point is for the act to be complete (Tib. *tshang ba*) and flawless (Tib. *ma nor ba*), and that the way of acting, the words, and the sequence should be without disorder (Tib. *ma 'khrugs pa*). Whether a legal act comes about and is thus considered to be valid or effective (Tib. las chags pa) depends on many conditions. 79 The governing condition is that the saṃgha be in concord or in agreement. By this is understood that the saṃgha must have three special qualities (Tib. *dge 'dun khyad par gsum ldan*) or fulfill three principles (Tib. *chos gsum ldan tshang dgos pa*): (1) the quorum must be complete in number (a minimum of four, depending on the requirements for the respective legal act); (2) the members who complement the quorum must have the necessary virtues;80 and (3) the quorum must be free of the two discords, i.e., a) the discord of not attending the gathering, and b) the discord of leaving (without permission). 81 One of the many necessary virtues is that the *saṃgha* members need to stay within the same monastic boundary (Tib. *mtshams*, Skt. *sīmā*).82 Furthermore, to be suitable to function as the preceptor or as the resident teacher (Tib. *gnas kyi bla ma*), 
the respective *bhikṣu*s (or *bhikṣu*ṇīs) need to meet certain individual qualifications.83 Like the resident teacher, the preceptors need to be:
1. Venerable (Tib. *btsun pa*), i.e., have pure ethics, have not been stained by a major offense, 2. Steadfast (Tib. *brtan pa*), i.e., have ten (in the case of men) or twelve
(in the case of women) years of uninterrupted monastic standing after full ordination, 3. Learned (Tib. *mkhas pa*) in the Vinaya, the Tripiṭaka and the twentyone groups with five characteristics each (Tib. *lnga phrugs nyer gcig* po gang rung dang ldan pa), 
4. Helpful (Tib. *phan 'dog pa*) in twelve ways such as being compassionate, patient and so forth.84 Among these it is said that the teacher and the person ordained must share the same view on discipline. 

According to Śākyaprabha (ca. 7 th century) that means:
[Both] must regard a particular transgression to the rules (such as drinking alcohol) to be a transgression, i.e., both must view that which interferes with the monastic training as detrimental to spiritual growth. 

Conversely, if, for example, the aspirant believes that killing a fetus is not a basis for incurring a downfall, his view is discordant (*lta ba tha* dad) with that of the ceremonial master (CTHSN, f. 155b3) (as cited in Jamgön Kongtrul Tayé 1998: 338–339).

Most geshes seem to agree that a monastic rite is flawless and perfect (Tib. cho ga nyes med phun sum tshog pa) when (1) the words are in accordance with the rite and (2) the two disharmonies are absent, which in turn means 
(a) the number [of saṃgha members] is complete,85 and (b) the additional 
[saṃgha members] are suitable. 

If one prefers to follow the second approach of an ecumenical ordination, then one has to determine what exactly is meant by the absence of the two disharmonies or what is meant by being in concord and sharing the same views.

We have already discussed the need for sharing the same view (Tib. lta ba mthun pa, Skt. *samānadṛṣṭ*i)
86 concerning the interpretation of the Vinaya rules and the necessity to live or stay within the same monastic boundary, either as a resident or as a visiting monk or nun to perform monastic rites together. In this context, it becomes important to know whether and which saṃgha acts resident and visiting monks or nuns can perform together.

According to Kieffer-Pülz (1992: 365–66). visiting monks are not allowed to participate in the legal act of determination and announcement of the great boundary (Tib. *mtshams chen po*, Skt. *mahatī sīmā*) or the small boundary (Tib. *tshams bu chung*, Skt. khu*ḍḍalikā sīmā*). 87 Nevertheless, together with the rest of the *saṃgha* visiting monks must be present when the boundary marks (Tib. *mtshan ma*, Skt. *nimitta*)
88 are announced (1992: 387). 

Furthermore, there is a regulation that monks staying within the same boundary ‒ whether short-term residents (Tib. *gnas pa*, Skt. *āvāsika*)
89 or permanent residents (Skt. nai*vāsika*, Tib. *gnyug mar gnas pa*) ‒ should wait for each other instead of conducting the bi-monthly confession ceremony 
(Tib. *gso sbyong*; Skt. poṣ*adha*) separately. That is to say, they must conduct the legal act of confession ceremony together.90 From the context, it seems clear that "sharing the same view" does not necessarily refer to sharing the same interpretation of Vinaya rules, but first of all refers to the absence of quarrel, squabble, conflict of opinion, discord and dispute.91 What is pivotal is that no *saṃgha* member raises a formal objection in the case of differing views.

As mentioned above, at the time of the Buddha, there was not a plurality of Vinaya schools. Rather, resident and visiting monks belonged to the same Vinaya school. In consequence the Vinaya itself does not make any explicit statement as to how the different Vinaya schools could or should relate to each other in today's context. This is a question of exegesis and as such the issue is a touchstone for contemporary Buddhism.

## Can Visiting Monks Or Nuns Participate In Saṃgha Acts Of Different Vinaya Schools?

Against this background the question is raised whether today visiting monks who neither belong to the same Tibetan Buddhist ordination lineage nor to the same community (on a permanent basis) can or even must join saṃgha acts such as the bimonthly confession ceremony of the hosting Vinaya school. For example, there are many monks from the Vietnamese, Korean, or Taiwanese *Dharmaguptakavinaya* tradition who study in one of the three main Gelugpa institutions of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden Monastery in South India. Do they join the bimonthly poṣ*adha* ceremony and the annual rainy season retreat (Tib. *dbyar gnas*; Skt. varṣā), or must they convert first, i.e., return their precepts and become re-ordained in the Tibetan tradition? What happens on these days, what happens during the rite to end the rainy season retreat (Tib. *dgag dbye*; Skt. *pravāraṇā*)? Do visiting monks participate or not?

In October 2012, when I attended the meeting of the Gelongma committee at Sarah Institute in Dharamsala, I did not raise this particular question but a simpler one, i.e., whether monks of different Tibetan Buddhist ordination lineages can perform the poṣ*adha* ceremony together. This question was inspired by observations made over the last decades when ‒ during huge Tibetan Buddhist events like the Great Prayer Festival (Tib. *smon lam chen* mo) ‒ monks, regardless of their different Gelugpa monastic communities,92 gather and perform the poṣ*adha* ceremony together. Most Tibetan monks do not even know their exact lineage, they just know who ordained them and that it is Mūlasarvāstivāda.

Therefore, I raised this question with the Vinaya experts of the Gelongma committee, comprising monks of the four different major schools of Tibetan Buddhism living together during their three-month research stay. I was told they could perform a joint poṣ*adha* ceremony, even holding different Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* lineages. 93 Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup, one of the committee members, explained that according to the Vinaya, after having gathered in one place, it is not permitted to perform the poṣ*adha* ceremony separately. After permission has been given, it can be performed together. Even if the monks do not agree in their views, according to the MSV, the *karman* (legal act) is considered valid (Tib. 

las chags pa), provided no member of the community raises any objection.94 Karmans become invalid only if the boundary has not been properly established first. 

## Can Dharmaguptaka Nuns Practicing Tibetan Buddhism Convert To The Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya School?

Another question at stake is whether those Tibetan, Himalayan and/or Western nuns who live according to the Tibetan tradition but were fully ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition95 could "convert" to become Mūlasarvāstivāda nuns, and if so, how to do this.

clearly refers to the fact that the monks must assemble in one and the same *sīmā*, 
the first term has a different meaning in the Vinaya texts. It refers to the fact that nānāsaṃvāsakā bhikkhū (i.e., *bhikkhu*s belonging to different congregations) 
may not participate in the same *vinayakammas*. Monks become *nānāsaṃvāsaka* by three conditions, viz. (1) by disciplinary measures incurred to them, (2) by different views concerning disciplinary rules, and (3) by different views concerning *vinayakamma*s. These conditions allow the formation of separate Saṅghas. It follows that *samānasaṃvāsaka* and *nānāsaṃvāsaka* are terms which do not refer to absolute conditions of the relevant congregations, but depend on the point of view, i.e. a monk would always consider his own congregation as samānasaṃvāsaka monks, those with whom he would not perform common vinayakammas, however, as *nānāsaṃvāsakabhikkhū*" (Bechert 2001: 11–12).

95 Cf. Bhikṣu Thich Quang Ba, founding abbot of Van Hanh Monastery, Canberra 
(Australia), ordained 1974, stated during the Hamburg Congress 2007 in front of H.H. the Dalai Lama: "If you require the participation of senior *bhikṣuṇī*s from other *nikāya* traditions or *bhikṣuṇī*s ordained in other traditions but following the Tibetan tradition, I believe there are many who are more than happy to assist." 
(Dalai Lama XIV 2010: 258). Hüsken & Kieffer-Pülz (2012: 260–261) raise the question of re-ordination for those nuns who fully ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition but follow the Tibetan tradition. The question of reordination of nuns in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition in general, not in that particular case, was a controversial issue during the Vinaya conference in Dharamsala in 1998. One Tibetan scholar pointed out that one of the impediments to women's ordination is to have been previously ordained, whereas men may be re-ordained up to three times. It should be added here that Guṇaprabha's *Vinayasūtra* classifies the question of having been previously gone forth as one of six impediments that specially concern female candidates, cf. D 4117 (*'dul ba*), wu, 11b4; Jyväsjärvi (2011: 519). Bapat & Gokhale (1982: 
xl) render this: "When she has already become an ascetic (in some other school)." Whether such an impediment exists, has to be verified by asking the candidate: "Have you been gone forth previously?" (Tib. sngon rab tu byung ba In this context a senior Theravāda monk stated that in his view it would be sufficient for Tibetan Buddhist Dharmaguptaka bhik*ṣuṇī*s who strive to become Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇīs to declare in front of a Tibetan Buddhist bhikṣ*u saṃgha* that from now on they will follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* code of rules and henceforth belong to the same Vinaya school. For this, he was referring to Anālayo (2013: 323), who explains that:
In the Vinaya, the notion of being of a "different community," *nānasaṃvāsa*, refers to a case of disagreement about the rules. . . . The status of being *nānasaṃvāsa* thus comes into existence because of a yin nam). This question not only occurs in the list for women, but also in the list for men, as can be found in the Pravrajyāvastu (*Rab tu 'byung ba'i gzhi*), cf. 

Chung (2011: 91, § II.iii.1.3.3); Härtel (1956: 80, no. 35). For nuns, the **Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti* reads: "Had you gone forth previously?" (Tib. ci khyod sngon rab tu byung ba ma yin nam, Skt. *kaccit tvaṃ pūrvaṃ pravrajitā*), 
cf. Chapter 3 of this volume, section III.i.1.3.3, question 37, Kanjur D 6 (*'dul* ba), da, 109a7; Sch 253 Kṣudr-v(Bhī) 16 b2. This question is missing from the first list of impediments for admission of men in the Las brgya rtsa gcig pa
(Ekottarakarma*śataka*), D 4118 (*'dul ba*), wu, 101a5–b5 (cf. Chung 2011: 82 note 6), but does occur further down in the list of impediments for full ordination of monks. The full passage reads as follows (D 1, ka, 54b4–6): "[The instructor] 
should ask: 'You are not one who had gone forth previously?' If he says 'I have already gone forth,' one should [further] ask him: 'You are not one that had committed any of the four offenses (Tib. *ltung ba*, Skt. *āpatti*) from among the pārājikas? Or, in the event, that you descended, had you properly returned the training?' If he answers: 'I had commited an offense,' one has to tell him: 'Well then, depart!' If he says: 'I had not committed [such an offense],' one should ask him: 'Are you one who is now going forth?' If he answers: 'I am going forth,' one should ask him: 'Will you keep pure conduct/celibacy (*brahmacarya*) 
well?'" (*khyod sngon rab tu byung ba ma yin nam zhes dri bar bya'o* | | *gal te* byung ngo zhes zer na khyod la pham par 'gyur ba bzhi las ltung ba gang yang rung ba zhig byung ba ma yin nam | khyod 'bab pa na bslab pa legs par phul *lam* zhes dri bar bya'o | | *gal te ltung ba byung ngo zhes zer na* | | 'o na song shig ces brjod par bya'o | | gal te ma byung ngo zhes zer na | *ji ltar khyod da ltar rab tu* byung ba yin nam zhes dri bar bya'o | | gal te bdag rab tu byung ba yin zhes zer na *| khyod kyis tshangs par spyod pa legs par spyad dam zhes dri bar bya'o*). The difference is that women are only asked whether they had previously gone forth or not and if so, they have to depart. In general, having gone forth is one of the requirements for becoming fully ordained. Thus, here the question refers to a different case. As we will see below there seem to be cases in which reordination of *bhikṣuṇī*s are allowed, when no offense or return of training is involved, to gain certainty or to clear doubt (see also above p. 317 note 91).

dispute about the interpretation of the rules. Therefore it can be resolved by settling the dispute. Once there is agreement in relation to the interpretation of the Vinaya rules, those who were *nānasaṃvāsa* become again *samānasaṃvāsa*, part of the same community.

This raises the question of whether Tibetan *bhikṣu*s consider those *bhikṣu*ṇīs who are practicing in the Tibetan tradition and have taken their full ordination in the Dharmaguptaka tradition to be *nānāsaṃvāsika/~kā*96 (cf. 

Anālayo 2013: 323–325), and if so, whether they could become again samānasa*ṃvāsika/~kā* by such a declaration or by a *karman* settling a dispute 
(Tib. *zhi bar byed pa*) on interpretation of *Vinaya* rules. 

In the Tibetan translation of the Poṣ*adhavastu* (Tib. *Gso sbyong gi gzhi*) 
two ways of regaining the samānasaṃvās*ika* status are explained: 
Bhikṣus, there are the two ways of regaining the samānasaṃvās*ika* status. What are the two? Either one declares oneself on one's own to be of the same community, or one is reinstituted by the community 
[after one had been suspended by the community for not seeing an offense].97

## Tibetan:

Although currently there is no dispute on interpretation of *Vinaya* rules, the question arises whether one of these two saṃgha acts could be applied to the situation confronting us today. The second does not apply because there is no record of the Dharmaguptakas being suspended by the Mūlasarvāstivādins. From a historical point of view, the Dharmaguptaka school came into existence before the Mūlasarvāstivāda school. Thus, the Dharmaguptaka school cannot have split off from the Mūlasarvāstivāda school due to a dispute between two early communities.

The question is whether Dharmaguptaka nuns, despite practicing in the Tibetan tradition, could declare themselves on their own to be of the same Vinaya school as the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda monks. In this context, during a personal communication the leading Tibetan Vinaya expert Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup did indicate that should nuns like myself who have received ordination in the Dharmaguptaka tradition from *bhikṣu*s alone express doubt as to whether, for example, they had been ordained properly, in his view, based on a passage in the Bhikṣuṇī*vinayavibhaṅga* they could be re-ordained by *bhik*ṣus alone in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition.98 For this we have not only canonical evidence, but also a precedent. As already mentioned above, around the years 432–434 a re-ordination of bhik*ṣuṇī*s took place in China: Nuns were ordained by monks alone. When nuns from Sri Lanka arrived and stayed with them for about six years, doubts arose among the Chinese nuns, as to whether their ordination had involved an offense, and thus they asked Guṇavarman whether re-ordination were possible. He confirmed that receiving the ordination a second time would, indeed, be of benefit. There is no mention that they would have to return their vows before taking them a second time. On the contrary, the biography of the nun Pao-hsien (no. 34; 401–477) clearly states that "[Gunavarman] had not said that the first transmission to China, from the Assembly of Monks only, was invalid. He had said, rather, that the second transmission [that included the Assembly of Nuns] was augmenting the good value of the obligation that had already been received" (Tsai 1994: 63).

There is a third option. Instead of performing an ecumenical ordination, one could follow the example of the Bodhgayā ordinations 1998, wherein after the Dharmaguptaka ordination has been conducted in front of both kinds of saṃgha, Theravāda *bhikkhu*s "have had the function of what in the modern tradition is known under the technical term of daḷhī*kamma*, literally 'making strong'. This refers to a formal act through which a *bhikkhu* or a group of bhikkhus ordained elsewhere gain the recognition of a particular community of which he or they wish to be part" (Anālayo 2013: 324).

A first gesture in this direction had already been made by the Dalai Lama when he stated in Hamburg in 2009: "There are already nuns within the Tibetan tradition who have received the full bhik*ṣuṇī* vow according to the Dharmaguptaka lineage and who we recognize as fully ordained" (Dalai Lama XIV 2010: 279). But although they are recognized as bhik*ṣuṇī*s, they are still Dharmaguptaka nuns and thus must follow a different *Vinaya* than the Tibetan monks. Supposing there were at least twelve Tibetan or Himalayan *bhikṣu*ṇīs who have been ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition, would it be possible for them to declare in front of a Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu saṃgha* that from now on they wish to be part of the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya school? Or alternatively, could they be ordained a second time by Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣus* alone, with this ceremony being considered their conversion to the Mūlasarvāstivādav*inaya* school? The answer to these questions can only be reconstructed by reflecting on the various procedural and other issues involved. We will not find a ready-made solution to this 21st century question in the ancient texts. It requires interpretation according to today's context, as well as competent *bhikṣu*s, well-learned in the *Vinaya* and willing to assume responsibility, who have the approval and support of their respective monastic communities.

4.3 Historic Decision Taken by the "12th Religious Conference of the Four Major Schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon Tradition" After about 30 years of research and discussion on the matter, on June 20, 2015, the "12th Religious Conference of the Four Major Schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon Tradition," 99 organized by the Department of Religion and Culture, announced the following decision on "Agenda item 2" during its closing ceremony, which was attended by the Dalai Lama and the head Lamas of all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

The

2.1 Although [the issue has been] discussed in the ["Religious] Conferences" up to now and research has been done accordingly, it is difficult to reach a clear decision on whether there is a way to ordain bhikṣuṇīs in the noble Dharma Vinaya tradition of the Mūla-sarvāstivāda, which spread to Tibet. Thus, in order to avoid any further delay with regard to the matter of ordination of *bhikṣuṇī*s, the majority approved that it is alright if nuns, in accordance with their individual wish become fully ordained, take the *bhikṣuṇī* vow in the Dharmaguptaka tradition.

Also the *saṃgha* acts related to the three [most relevant] skandhakas [of the *Vinayavastu*] and signify monastic life such as how to perform the *poṣadha* (confession) should be made available in a proper, fully-characterized way in accordance with that tradition then. Also the precepts from an *upāsikā* up to a *bhikṣuṇī* should be given in the way they are received in that [Dharmaguptaka] tradition.

Gelongma) or Drangsongma103 does exist, this fact has been noted.104

## 4.3.1 Implications Of The Decision Taken At The Conference

At first glance, the decision merely seems to confirm the status quo, because the Dalai Lama had already stated during the Hamburg Congress in 2007:
One thing we can do now is to translate the three primary monastic activities (*poṣadha, varṣā*, and *pravāraṇā*) from the Dharmagupta lineage into Tibetan and encourage the Tibetan *bhikṣuṇīs* to do these practices as a *bhikṣuṇī saṃgha.* (Dalai Lama XIV 2010: 279)
The significance of the decision by the "12th Religious Conference," however, should not be underestimated.

The major breakthrough in this decision is the acknowledgement of the validity of the East Asian Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination lineage. By acknowledging that Tibetan nuns could be ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition, the participants have conceded that it is a reliable lineage. This development is new, highly significant, and differs from the position held during their last "11th Religious Conference" in 2011, when they were still casting doubt on the validity of the ordination lineage of the Dharmagupta nuns, stating "with regard to the *bhikṣu*ṇī lineages of other schools, doubts with regard to a pure source have not been utterly overcome or demolished."
Also, considering that the Tibetan canon was closed in the 14th century, at the time of Bu-ston (Bu ston Rin chen grub, 1290–1364), and that during the time of King Tri Ralpachen (Khri Ral pa can, r. 815–838) a decree had been issued not to spread other Vinayas aside from the Mūlasarvāstivāda in Tibet, 105 a major step has been taken in deciding that the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptakas will be added to the Tibetan canonical texts, i.e., the Kanjur and Tanjur. This falls in line with a more comprehensive plan: In January 2011, during the "Tengyur Translation Conference" at the Central University of Tibetan Studies (CUTS) in Sarnath/Varanasi, the Dalai Lama proposed to "collect all the texts from the Asian canons (Chinese, Korean, Pali, Sanskrit, Tibetan) and make sure that the texts missing in one are included in another."
106 The Dalai Lama repeatedly expressed the wish to have the early discourses of the Buddha, the Pāli Sūtras translated into Tibetan.

Should the Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī practice be further introduced in Tibetan Buddhism, this would be a major step toward recognizing other Buddhist traditions on an equal footing.

## 4.3.2 Shortcomings Of The Decision

Nonetheless, no logical conclusions have been drawn regarding the restoration of the nuns' ordination lineage in the Mūlasarvāstivāda school, despite decades of efforts and research initiated by the Dalai Lama, who exhorted scholars to find possibilities for restoring *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination.

During the congress in 2007 in Hamburg, the Dalai Lama stated (2010: 
268):
First of all, I just want to make clear that we all accept and recognize as *bhikṣuṇīs* those Tibetans and Westerners who have received Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣuṇī* ordination. This is not the issue. The issue is to find the way to ordain *bhikṣuṇīs* that is in accordance with the Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* texts.

This hope was reconfirmed in a letter by H.H. the Dalai Lama directed to the Committee for Bhikṣuṇī Ordination in the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition, 107 dated January 20, 2013, which states: 
As one individual, I do not have the authority to institute the *bhikshuni* ordination in the Tibetan community. This is an issue for the sangha collectively to decide. However, I have long encouraged the convening of an international meeting of the *sangha* to discuss the issue. In preparation for that, it would be good if Tibetan *bhikshus* were to agree upon a way in which that the Mūlasarvastivada *bhikshuni* ordination could be given.

Furthermore, in 2007, the Dalai Lama had also stated (2010: 268–269):
I can institute that the Tibetan *bhikṣuṇīs* ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition meet in groups to perform the three *saṅgha* rituals. . . . I can have the appropriate texts for the Dharmaguptaka versions of these three *saṅgha* rituals translated from Chinese into Tibetan immediately and encourage the Tibetan *bhikṣuṇīs* to begin doing these practices as a community. With the support of the other bhikṣus here, I can say that much; no one will oppose that. 

Thus, the official decision taken by the "12th Religious Conference" that despite all the successful research submitted, "it is difficult" to reach a clear decision, is unfortunate. Moreover, the choice of "de dka' las khag po 'dug" is telling, because in its Tibetan colloquial version this wording carries the meaning of something that is not only difficult but not possible, something you cannot or do not want to do. The conference was supposed to decide how to revive the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī order and by which approach. It did not do so. 

Why is this important?

Most of those novice nuns who are interested in full ordination want their own teachers to be involved in their ordination, and do not want to receive an ordination in a culture and a linguistic setting not familiar to them. After decades of research, since about 1980, the heads of the traditions were unable to decide how these nuns should proceed. It is therefore unreasonable to expect these nuns, many of whom have not had access to higher education in the Vinaya and most of whom are uncertain whether they have the support of their male teachers, to decide on their own how to proceed.

Moreover, it is unclear how the women ordained as Tibetan Dharmaguptaka bhik*ṣunī*s would subsequently undertake *karman*s that require the cooperation of *bhikṣu*s. Would they be done with Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhik*ṣus? If yes, which Vinaya will be used? If so, will all *bhikṣu*s agree to do it, or may they opt out saying that this is a different Vinaya tradition, and that the bhikṣuṇīs should get *bhikṣu*s from East Asian countries to help them?

The decision taken in June 2015 by the "12th Religious Conference" that Tibetan Buddhist novice nuns can decide on their own to take ordination in the East Asian Dharmaguptaka tradition carries great weight. With that decision the majority of the Buddhist leaders present were agreeing to introduce the *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage from the Dharmaguptaka tradition into Tibetan Buddhism. It remains unclear, though, how Tibetan *bhikṣu*s of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition will relate to the Tibetan Dharmaguptaka bhik*ṣuṇī*s on a day-to-day practical level.

Whether in the end, the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī practice will be revived in the Karma Kagyü tradition headed by the Gyalwang Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, or the Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī practice will be further introduced into the other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, this decision was a major step toward recognizing other Buddhist traditions on an equal footing, and thus a true sign of a growing pluralist attitude toward other Buddhist traditions. Therefore, irrespective of its shortcomings, it should be regarded as a great success and an important milestone.

## 4.4 Prospects

Now, much hope lies with the Karmapa as well as with other Buddhist leaders and with Tibetan Buddhist novice nuns who are bold enough to act on this decision. 

On January 24, 2015, during the Second Ārya Kṣemā Winter Dharma Gathering at Tergar Monastery in Bodhgayā, the 17th Karmapa, Orgyen Thrinle Dorje, made the announcement that108 he would take concrete steps toward restoring nuns' vows in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. It seems that he is planning to opt for the ecumenical approach to ordination, beginning with the conferral of the novice 'getsulma' (*śrāmaṇerikā*) and training 
'*śikṣamāṇā*' nun's vows, conferred with the assistance of a special contingent of nuns from the Dharmaguptaka tradition. This would lay the necessary framework leading to 'gelongma' or '*bhikṣu*ṇī' full nun's vows.109 Among Tibetan Vinaya scholars, as is known, it is controversial whether ordination by *bhik*ṣus alone would be valid. So far no majority has been achieved on this first approach. Obviously in line with this view, the Karmapa argues110 that because there are no bhik*ṣuṇī* vows in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, one cannot speak of proper *śrāmaṇerikā* vows either, and therefore it is difficult to say that there is a truely ordained saṃgha of women who have gone forth within the Tibetan tradition.

This statement has caused some resentment around the globe, but it could also be taken as an example of a typical hard-eghed Tibetan philosophical debate. As mentioned above, there is clear canonical evidence that, if circumstances so require, *bhik*ṣus can give all stages of women's ordination, starting with the going forth and reaching all the way up to the full ordination. On the other hand, according to the *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination rite, the going forth and the precepts of a lay woman, of a novice, and of a probationer should be given by *bhikṣu*ṇīs. In the Tibetan tradition, however, for over a millenium, the female lay and novice precepts have been given by *bhikṣu*s. This raises the question of legitimacy. When this practice is based on the same *Vinaya* commentaries which exceptionally allow *bhikṣu*s to give *śikṣamāṇā* and bhikṣuṇī ordination, shouldn't they be implemented consistently? The same reasoning that is applied in justifying the granting of lower ordination to women by *bhikṣu*s would apply to the granting of high ordination to women by *bhikṣu*s, yet that tradition has preferred not to apply that reasoning and instead keep women restricted to a lower level of ordination.

While pointing out the hypocrisy in that inconsistency, the solution the Karmapa proposed instead is to have *bhikṣu*ṇīs ordained by a twofold saṃ*gha* 
(*ubhayasaṃgha*) of ten Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s and twelve Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs two years later.111 During a meeting with the Karmapa on August 28, 2015 in Bonn, Germany, he confirmed that the decision of the "12th Religious Conference" had not affected his plans. He said he would continue to take concrete steps toward restoring nuns' vows in Tibetan Buddhism through the second approach. At that time, the Karmapa was planning to invite nuns from the Dharmaguptaka tradition to confer the upāsikā, *śrāmaṇerikā* and *śikṣamāṇā* vows.112 Two years later, leading monks of the Karma Kagyü tradition were expected to confer the Mūlasarvāstivāda bhik*ṣuṇī* vows together with the Dharmaguptaka nuns, after the latter have given the brahma*caryopasthāna*. 

The ordination was planned to be carried out in the Chinese language, and translation would have been provided. For the detailed planning he announced he would soon set up a committee. Furthermore, he stated that he would like to utilize a *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination manual included in the *Collected* Works by the 8th Karmapa Mi bskyod rdo rje (1507–1554) ('*Dul ba'i las* chog mthong ba don 'grub).113 The first approach, an ordination by *bhikṣu*s alone, no longer seemed to be an option for him, because the majority of the decision-makers would not accept it. At times when ordinations were given by monks alone, in the 13th to 15th centuries, this led to harsh criticism.114 The Karmapa does not want this history to be repeated, and therefore chooses a different way in hopes of avoiding such social backlash.115 For the future of Tibetan Buddhist monasticism, much is riding on how the first Tibetan *bhikṣu*ṇīs conduct themselves. Setting up strong nuns' orders will set strong precedents. This is why the Karmapa wants to start it in an organized way, and not leave it up to the nuns as individuals. He has also said that great emphasis will be placed on the training of these *bhikṣu*ṇīs.

A further major step toward full ordination for Tibetan Buddhist nuns was taken on March 10 and 11, 2017 at the Mahābodhi Stūpa in Bodhgayā, when in the presence of the Gyalwang Karmapa nineteen women from six different nunneries of the Karma Kagyü tradition received *śrāmaṇerikā* precepts from Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī masters from the Nan Lin Vinaya Nunnery in Taiwan. At the conclusion of the rite, one of the new *śrāmaṇerikā*s, Tsunmo Tsultrim Sangpo, stated in front of the Karmapa: "On behalf of all the shramaneris, I would like to say that we have the great hope that we will be able to take the shramaneri, *shikshamana*, and *bhikshuni* vows in succession and be able to restore the *bhikshuni* vow within the Mulasarvastivadin tradition."116 To which the Karmapa replied: 
In general, the shramaneri vow is available in all four Buddhist traditions of Tibet, but this morning, a special shramaneri vow was given. Why is it special? Because this vow is the preliminary step to restoring the bhikshuni ordination in our tradition. And the reason it is so important to restore these vows is that according to the standpoint of the Vinaya, all of the vows that women can take should be given by bhikshunis and all the vows that men can take should be given by bhikshus. In Tibetan Buddhism, however, we have not had a continuous lineage of bhikshunis, so bhikshus have taken their place and given vows to women. It is rather difficult to say that this is completely in accord with the meaning and intent of the vinaya. For that reason, so that women can actually take vows, bhikshunis are indispensable. We need women to become bhikshunis. This is why it is so important to restore the bhikshuni vow. It seems that since then, no progress has been made. The reason may be that in October 2017 the Karmapa left for the United States where he is believed to have been residing since that time. On 21 January 2019, on the last day of the 36th Kagyu Monlam, the Karmapa reported via webcast that a new passport [from the Commonwealth of Dominica] had been issued for him, and that once he received it, his old document, his Indian Identity Certificate became invalidated. Although he had applied for a visa to return to India in October 2018, he explained that he was still waiting for a response from the authorities.117 Although Tibetan Buddhist *śrāmaṇerikā*s may have preferred to receive all stages of ordination from their leading Tibetan male Vinaya masters, in the long run and on a global level, the decision to include the centuries-long practical experience of Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs in the learning process will prove to be valuable. However, for Tibetan nuns who do not belong to the Karma Kagyü tradition ‒ unless their teachers encourage them in a similar way ‒ their wait for the opportunity to take full ordination in the Dharmaguptaka tradition may be long indeed.

For women in the West practicing in the Tibetan tradition, it may be less crucial whether they become ordained in the Dharmaguptaka or the Mūla-sarvāstivāda tradition. Thus, it may be helpful to have a clear decision on which of the two options to take when pursuing nuns' ordination. If they are interested in full ordination, such guidelines will assist as they evaluate where to direct their attention and interest when it comes to Vinaya practice.

Due to the decisions taken by the 12th Religious Conference and by the Karmapa, the acceptance of Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs will further grow in Tibetan Buddhism. This will continue once the nuns' teachers have access to the relevant texts in their own Tibetan language and can study the similarities and differences between the two Vinaya traditions, the Mūlasarvāstivāda and the Dharmaguptaka.

It is a good sign that nowadays dialogue on Vinaya not only takes place among nuns but now also among monks. The nuns officially began networking on this issue during the "First International [Sakyadhita] 
Conference on Buddhist Nuns" in 1987118, the monks during the "International Conference on Vinaya," organized by the CUTS, January 17–19, 2011. 

Another dialogue, carried out on the level of Sri Lankan and Tibetan Buddhist leaders, is being referred to as "an historic conclave" organized by the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) in New Delhi on March 18 and 19, 2015. 119 Considering that dialogue cannot take place between traditions but only between persons, the various initiatives will increasingly bear fruit on an individual level and help build trust in order to learn from each other, which in turn will fertilize the discourse also on an institutional level.

The Tibetan dialogue among the Buddhists of the four major traditions and the Bon tradition has also grown over the years. On December 29, 2011, during my stay at the CUTS in Sarnath, I had the opportunity to meet with one of the leading Bonpo scholars of the Department of Bon Sampradaya Shastra. It was through him that I found out that Bon monks keep 250 precepts, whereas nuns keep 360 precepts. The number of precepts is very similar to the numbers Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda monks (253) and nuns 
(364) keep. In the Bon tradition today, which has spread widely in Amdo and Kham but not in Central Tibet (namely Ü-tsang and Ngari), all stages of women's ordination are given by Bonpo *bhikṣu*s alone. Some contemporary Tibetan Buddhist monk scholars seem to assume that Bon was patterned after Buddhist *saṃgha* and thus is emulating it and not "authentic."

Considered for the sample collation (Part 1, **Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu*) 
as well as for the editions of the text edition Part 2 (Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*):
The editions 1–7 (LRTNHSZ) belong to the Thems spangs ma tradition (Western group / branches), the editions 9–13 (QKJB) to the *Tshal pa* tradition (Eastern group / branches). The Derge edition is based on the 'Jang sa tham block print from the *Tshal pa* tradition but contains numerous emendations according to the Thems spangs ma tradition. The Phu brag edition could not be clearly assigned to either of the two traditions on the basis of the evaluated data. The compilation in the latest edition of Dpe bsdur ma (Beijing 2006–2009) is largely based on Derge and takes into account the readings of seven other editions. It was not included in the apparatus of the edition presented here.

## Online Bibliography In Connection With The Project

Thanks to the DFG overhead funds at my disposal, a bibliography on the subject "Buddhist Nuns' Ordination in the Tibetan Canon" could be compiled from this budget. This project was especially supported by the librarian Birte Plutat, who in 1993 concluded her master thesis on "Ordained Women in Buddhism". The undertaking of this project deemed necessary, because only a part of the literature was published independently and thus accessible via library catalogues and specialist databases. It contains about 1,400 titles, partly with the full texts. The large amount of data required thematic sorting. A project-specific system was developed specifically for this purpose. The bibliography was created and maintained in a database for sustainable maintenance and usability. The decision was made in favour of the literature management system Citavi, as this program convinces by its scope of performance and user friendliness. The creation of the bibliography included the following task packages:
- Research of the published literature in the relevant catalogues and specialist databases - currently until July 2017
- Incorporation of literature references into a Citavi database
- Development of a topic-specific system and indexing of the content of the titles in the database.

- Maintenance of existing full texts and addition of Open Access publications, especially from the Internet The publication of the bibliography on the Internet ‒ an alphabetical and a systematically sorted list of the relevant titles ‒ is accessible on the pages of the Numata Center for Buddhism Studies and the following URL: <

Professor Roloff has offered an enormous gift to Vinaya scholars, to scholars of Tibetan Buddhism, to the monastic community, to scholars of women in religion, and most of all to Buddhist women both lay and monastic with the publication of Buddhist Nuns' Ordination in the Tibetan Canon. The editions and translations of important texts concerning the ordination of women are erudite, comprehensive and clear. They will be invaluable primary resources for anyone interested in the issue of the restoration of the Tibetan nuns' full ordination lineage. Prof. Roloff's analysis of the legal and religious issues, and her argument for the procedure for the restoration of this lineage is meticulous and convincing, setting a new standard for argument in this important debate.

An academic book to be proud of for this cntury and centuries to come. Bhikkhunīs around the world offer deep gratitude to her work.

Venerable Bhikkhuni Dhammanandā (Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh), the first Theravāda bhikkhunī in Thailand and Professor Emeritus, Thammasat University Amidst a wealth of discussions on Buddhist nns' ordination, this edition and translation of a fascinating text on rituals and regulations in the Tibetan tradition presents a much-needed exploration of all the salient issues. Leaving no stone unturned, it lays the foundation for future research and is essential reading for anyone with an interest in gender and institutions.

Prof. Dr. Ann Heirman, Head of the Department of Languages and Cultures and the Centre for Buddhist Studies, Ghent University This is an important book. It will provide a solid foundation for any future discussion of what might be an unnecessarily complicated issue. The careful critical editions of the canonical sources involved are especially welcome. Gregory   Schopen,   Distinguished   Professor Emeritus, Department of Asian Languages &
Cultures, UCLA
