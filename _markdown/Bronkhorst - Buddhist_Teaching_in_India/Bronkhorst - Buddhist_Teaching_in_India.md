# 1. **Introduction**

The aim of this book is to give an overview of Buddhist teaching in India. **There** is a basic distinction between Buddhist *teaching* and Buddhist *philosophy*. These two are not to be taken as identical, even though they are closely related. **Philosophy** is a Western term1that might be applied to some, but by no means all, **Buddhist**
teachings. We shall see for example that the Buddha was clearly averse to any **kind** of speculation and that he positively avoided 'philosophically' important **questions.**
One might conclude from this that the Buddha, and to some extent this also **goes**
for later Buddhism, did not teach *philosophy* as such. But teach he did, and therefore there is definitely a Buddhist *teaching*. This is not to deny that **important**
'philosophical' developments took place in Buddhism.2 On the contrary, it **appears**
that the rise of philosophy in India was largely due to Buddhism. Certain **Buddhist** teachings were definitely of great philosophical importance; we will have **occasion** to return to this question below. This does not alter the fact that anyone **undertaking**
a description of Buddhist *philosophy* will primarily be interested in **'philosophically**
interesting' teachings and in this way will apply an outer criterion. This is **further** complicated by the fact that from a certain point onward various Buddhist **schools** tried to systematize their teachings. For the philosopher a systematized **teaching** is more interesting than a jumble of non-systematized, sometimes badly thought out teachings. The philosophically inclined scholar can therefore turn his **attention** to these Buddhist attempts at systematization and leave out many of the **other**
teachings. A description of the *teachings* of Buddhism, on the other hand, **aims** at using inner criteria: a particular teaching is not described **because** it is of philosophical interest to us or because it is thought out systematically, but **because** Buddhists themselves considered it important. The importance of a **teaching** in Buddhism is primarily related to the question how prominent a role it plays in the process of liberation. This will therefore be our criterion in the **description** of Buddhist **teachings.**3 Insight or wisdom (often called *prajñ*ā) plays an important **role** in Buddhism. The Buddhist gains this wisdom while progressing on the **path** to liberation, most often at its end. Attainment of this wisdom is crucial for the attainment of liberation. It is hardly surprising that the highest wisdom, the key to the highest goal of the Buddhist religion, is frequently described in the **texts.** It is indeed an important part of Buddhist teaching. For those Buddhists who **believe** that the highest insight cannot be expressed in words, this description of the **highest** wisdom is only approximate and not precise. This does not alter the fact that a **part** of Buddhist teaching is, or claims to be, a description of the wisdom that **leads** to the ultimate **liberation.**
However, that is not all there is to Buddhist teaching. Highest wisdom may produce liberation for those Buddhists who are far advanced on the path, but one first has to know how to get to this advanced stage. Buddhist teaching has **much** to say about that, too. The ideal behaviour of devout Buddhists, primarily monks and nuns, is prescribed in the so-called Vinaya-piṭaka. Then there are the concepts and notions of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, who personify the ideal and serve as **models** for devout Buddhists. Buddhist teaching in a narrower sense contains **numerous**
instructions in spiritual practice. These are mainly found in the discourses (sūtra)
4 collected in the "Basket of Discourses" (Sūtra-piṭaka). In other words, **Buddhist**
teaching does not merely concern the insight which leads to liberation, but **also** whatever else one needs to know in order to follow the path to **liberation.**
Thirdly, Buddhist teaching comprises what Buddhists believe, or **believed,**
even if it is of no direct relevance to liberation. For example, the **cosmographic** ideas of the Indian Buddhists, which found widespread acceptance, do not **appear** to be essential for the attainment of liberation. Such ideas do not at first seem to **have** much to do with the Buddhist religion in a narrow sense. Indeed, Indian **Buddhists** and non-Buddhists share many ideas, including many that are of a religious **nature.** However, it is not always easy to determine which ideas are religious and which are not. The example of cosmography is illuminating. A priori one might assume **that** these ideas have little if anything to do with religion generally, or with **Buddhism** in particular. However, that is not the case. As we shall see later, **certain** cosmographic concepts are closely related to specific Buddhist meditative **states.** Consequently they, too, deserve attention in a presentation of Buddhist **teaching.**
It is impossible, given the scope of the present publication, to **attempt** an exhaustive description of all the Buddhist teachings that ever existed in **India.** A selection had to be made, guided by the intention to elucidate the links **between** certain main teachings, rather than to offer as much information as possible **after** the manner of an encyclopedia. The aim is to understand these selected **teachings** in their historical, cultural and intellectual context. This means, unfortunately, **that** many Buddhist teachings, texts and thinkers have to remain unmentioned.

# 2. The Teaching Of The **Buddha**

Preliminary remarks on methodology Hermann Oldenberg's ground breaking work **Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre,** seine Gemeinde (subsequently translated into English under the title: **Buddha, his** 
Life, his Doctrine, his Order) was first published in 1881. In the **chapter** on teaching, one notices the curious fact that Oldenberg speaks throughout about **"the**
teachings of Buddhism" rather than "the teaching(s) of the Buddha", as one **might**
have expected. Helmuth von Glasenapp emphasizes this detail in his **concluding**
note (*Nachwort*) to the 13th edition of this book that came out in 1959. **Glasenapp**
points out that this choice of phrase reveals the critical view of the **author,** according to whom we do not know anything for certain about the teaching of the Buddha. Indeed, the material available to us is only sufficient to establish what the earliest community may have understood Buddhist teaching to be. **Glasenapp,** while generally agreeing with Oldenberg's view, thinks that there is **reason** to believe that the most important ideas of the tradition can be traced back to the Blessed One himself. Glasenapp finds these ideas expressed in the **so-called**
dharma theory, which will be dealt with in more detail in later chapters. This **theory** finds its classic expression many centuries after the Buddha in the *Abhidharmako*śa of Vasubandhu who supposedly lived in the 5th century CE. Previous **scholars,** in their enthusiasm about the discovery of the dharma theory, had gone so far as to believe that the teachings of the *Abhidharmako*śa corresponded largely, **even**
though not in every detail, to the oldest teaching. Glasenapp names **Theodor** Stcherbatsky and Otto Rosenberg as holding this view, while he himself had followed in their footsteps in his article "Zur Geschichte der **buddhistischen** Dharma-Theorie", published in 1938. Here Glasenapp had come to the **conclusion**
that the philosophical basis developed in the *Abhidharmako*śa constitutes the **basis**
of the whole of Buddhism. "However much the Buddhist schools differ from **each** other in many details, in the general principles of their teaching they all agree **with** each other. The oldest layer that we can get to of Buddhist tradition **already** contained the essential ideas that have found refined expression in the Abhidharmakośa. There is reason to assume that already the teaching of **Gotama**
Buddha corresponded in its essence to that what we find in the great **Buddhist** philosophers of the classical period, be it that the latter have adapted it to the way of thinking of their own time, and have further elaborated it and worked it out in detail." Glasenapp criticizes other scholars for assuming that Buddhism was not grounded in any kind of metaphysical concept. He finds this assumption **unlikely** in view of the fact that all other religious and philosophical systems in India **accept** a larger or smaller number of ultimate realities. He argues that if Buddhism **wanted** to compete with these other systems, it could not restrict itself to being a **practical** doctrine of liberation only: it, too, had to provide answers to **numerous** metaphysical **questions.**
This editorial note by Glasenapp prompted an almost immediate **response** by the American scholar Franklin Edgerton (1959). In his article, which was **published** in 1959, the same year as Glasenapp's concluding note, Edgerton points out that the same ancient texts which Glasenapp studied also contain passages stating that the Buddha explicitly refuses to engage in philosophical speculations. Probably the **best**
known passage of this kind is found in the Cūḻa-Māluṅ*kya-Sutta* of the *Majjhima* Nikāya of the Pāli Sutta-piṭaka.

5 Oldenberg paraphrases this passage as **follows:**
The venerable Māluṅkyāputta comes to the Master and expresses his astonishment that the Master's discourse leaves a series of the very **most** important and deepest questions unanswered. Is the world **eternal** or is it limited by the bounds of time? Is the world infinite, or does it have an **end?** Is the living being identical with the body or different from it? Does the Perfect One (tathā*gata*) live on beyond death? Does the Perfect One not **live**
on beyond death? It pleases me not, says the monk, that all this **should** remain unanswered, and I do not think it right; therefore I am come to the Master to interrogate him about these doubts. May it please the **Buddha** to answer them if he can. "But when anyone does not understand a thing and does not know it, then a straight-forward man says: I do not understand **that,** I do not know **that."**
The Buddha answers: "What have I said to thee before **now,**
Māluṅkyāputta? Have I said: Come, Māluṅkyāputta, and be my **disciple;** I shall teach thee, whether the world is everlasting or not everlasting, **whether** the world is finite or infinite, whether the vital faculty is identical with the body or separate from it, whether the Perfect One lives on after **death** or does not live on, or whether the Perfect One lives on and at the same **time**
 

5 MN I 426-432; Sutta no. 63.

does not live on after death, or whether he neither lives on nor does not **live** on?"
"That thou hast not said, **sire."** "Or hast thou," the Buddha goes on, "said to me: I shall be thy disciple, declare unto me, whether the world is everlasting or not everlasting, and so **on?"**
This also Māluṅkyāputta must answer in the **negative.** A man, the Buddha proceeds, was struck by a poisoned arrow, and his friends and relatives called in a skilful physician. What if the **wounded** man said: "I shall not allow my wound to be treated until I know who the man is by whom I have been wounded, whether he is a noble, a **Brahmin,** a Vaiśya, or Śūdra" - or if he said: "I shall not allow my **wound** to be treated, until I know what they call the man who has wounded me, and of what family he is, whether he is tall, or small, or of middle stature, and how his weapon was made, with which he has struck me." What would the end of the case be? The man would die of his **wound.**
Why has the Buddha not taught his disciples, whether the **world** is finite or infinite, whether the accomplished one lives on beyond **death** or not? Because the knowledge of these things does not conduce to **progress** in holiness, because it does not contribute to peace and enlightenment. **What** contributes to peace and enlightenment, the Buddha has taught his own: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, the truth of the path to the cessation of **suffering.**
"Therefore, Māluṅkyāputta, whatsoever has not been revealed by me, let that remain unrevealed, and what has been revealed, let it be **revealed."**6 There are other passages that indicate that the Buddha did not answer the **questions** whether the world is everlasting or not everlasting, whether the world is **finite** or infinite, whether the living being is identical with the body or separate from it, whether the Perfect One lives on after death or does not live on, or whether the Perfect One lives on and at the same time does not live on after death, or **whether**
he neither lives on nor does not live on.7 What can we conclude from the coexistence of passages in **which**
metaphysical speculations are rejected and passages in which the dharma **theory** is proclaimed or assumed? In his reply to Edgerton's critique Glasenapp (1960) **points** out that the fact that specific questions remained unanswered does not allow the general conclusion that all metaphysical problems were regarded as **unsolvable,** or that occupying oneself with them was regarded as fruitless. However, in the importance in the eyes of those who were responsible for the collection and preservation of his words. This may suffice to explain its supposed presence in the oldest texts. The existence of passages like the one from the Cūḻa-Māluṅ*kya-Sutta*,
on the other hand, passages which are not in agreement with later priorities, **should**
for this reason be given greatest importance. Even though one cannot exclude the possibility that first beginnings of the later dharma theory may have formed **part** of the teaching of the Buddha, we must abandon the idea that such a theory was **part**
of it.8 Besides, the evidence for the existence of the dharma theory in the **ancient**
Sūtras is far less conclusive than Glasenapp **assumed.** 
The controversy between Edgerton and Glasenapp allows us to draw **some**
important methodological conclusions. First, it shows that not every **word** attributed to the Buddha in the ancient discourses should necessarily be **taken** as having been pronounced by him. If we want to learn about the teaching of the Buddha we cannot avoid critically examining the ancient discourses. Second, the discussion has suggested a possible method by which - in some cases at **least** - older parts of the teaching can be distinguished from later additions and developments. What is involved is a layering of teachings, rather than a **layering** of texts.9 Two types of passage were mentioned in the controversy between **Edgerton**
and Glasenapp: on the one hand those in which all metaphysical speculations are rejected and on the other hand those in which the dharma theory is **expressed** or at least assumed. These two types of passages contradict each other, at least **according** to Edgerton. If he is right in this, one must assume that only one of the **positions** represented in those passages can be original. The Buddha did not **reject** metaphysical teachings while at the same time teaching a metaphysical **doctrine**
himself. One has to choose one way or the other: *either* the Buddha **rejected** metaphysical teachings or he taught a metaphysical doctrine himself. The **same**
choice is required wherever we encounter contradictions in the ancient **Canon.**10 The choice is relatively easy where one is able to identify the origin of one of the contradictory teachings, either in a later development of Buddhism or in non- Buddhist currents of the time. In the case of the dharma theory, for example, the origin is easy to identify: we shall see below that dharmas become a **major** preoccupation of later Buddhism. Nevertheless, it is not possible to reduce **this** method to a mechanical process. As we have seen above, where Edgerton saw a contradiction, Glasenapp saw none. Besides, even in relatively clear cases, **where** this method can be employed without problems, one could question the result. Can one really attribute the teaching arrived in this manner to the historical **Buddha?**
Perhaps the Buddha did not reject all metaphysical theories, even if he did not **teach**
the dharma **theory.**
One might criticize Glasenapp and other scholars for projecting **later**
Buddhist teachings onto the historical Buddha. However, they did search for the teaching of the Buddha in the corpus of discourses attributed to him. Other **authors** try to show that very little of the original teaching of the Buddha has **been** preserved in the Buddhist canon. They claim that, in order to qualify as **remains** of what they call "pre-canonical Buddhism", passages and teachings **have** to be in contradiction with generally recognized canonical positions.11 Some other **scholars**
are of the opinion that the true nature of earliest Buddhism is not found in the ancient discourses at all, but only in the inscriptions of Aśoka (3rd century **BCE).**12 Closely related to this is another opinion which states that it is outright **impossible** to know anything definite about the teaching content of the discourses before the 4th century CE.13 These scholars might be accused of throwing away the baby **with**
the bath water, as they do not even take into consideration passages that are not contradicted by other passages. It is indeed the non-contradicted passages **that** we may expect to contain information about earliest Buddhist **teaching.**
We, cautiously, opt for the general principle that the teaching that the ancient discourses ascribe to the Buddha can indeed be ascribed to him.14 **Only**
where there are reasons to doubt the authenticity of a certain teaching, for **example** because it contradicts other canonical statements, should we deviate from **this**
principle.15 Following this method to the extent possible, we now turn to the **actual**
teaching of the Buddha. Point of departure, as indicated, is the assumption **that** positions that are found in the early discourses and are not contradicted in **these** texts can be attributed to him. However, in cases where teachings are **presented** in the form of lists, the possibility of later scholastic influence has to be taken **into** account, given the later scholastic tendency to present all the teachings **which** it ascribed to the Buddha in lists. There where two or more contradictory opinions are ascribed to the Buddha, we have to examine two possibilities. One is that one of the contradicting opinions is also found in another religious movement current at the time. Another possibility is that one of the contradicting opinions belongs to a **later**
phase in the development of Buddhism.16 In both cases the opinion in question can be left out of consideration in our attempt to reconstruct the teaching of the Buddha. We have already drawn attention to the weak sides of the method and **need** not repeat them **here.**
A danger accompanying the study of early Buddhism is the **attempt,**
frequent in scholarly research, to reduce Buddhist terms to concepts current in the West. The large number of publications dealing with the Buddhist **Nirv**āṇa illustrates this.17 Such studies obscure the fact that much in the ancient **canonical**
texts leaves little to be desired in terms of clarity. We will therefore let the **texts** speak for themselves wherever possible. This way we may hope to avoid **excessive** speculation. Comparative studies of different versions of a passage, often **preserved** in both Pāli and Chinese, will, where they exist, be mentioned. In cases, **however,** where the differences between the versions is of little or no relevance for our presentation, we shall only quote a translation from the Pāli.

## Main Teachings

Let us now examine the details of the teaching of the Buddha. The first **question** to ask is: if the Buddha did not teach a metaphysical system, what then did he **teach?**
The passage from the Cūḻa-Māluṅ*kya-Sutta* quoted above gives the **following**
answer. The Buddha preached what is conducive to the holy life and to peace and enlightenment: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the **truth** of the cessation of suffering, the truth of the path leading to the cessation of **suffering.** This message is repeated frequently. Some examples: "Monks, both formerly and now what I teach is suffering and the cessation of suffering."18 "[...] for it is **praise**
of the Perfect One (tathā*gata*) to say of him: 'When he teaches the **Dharma** to anyone, it leads him when he practises it to the complete cessation of **suffering.'"**19 The teaching of the Buddhas, according to other passages, is suffering, its origin, its cessation and the path leading to **cessation.**20 The four truths referred to are known as the Four Noble Truths. **Perhaps**
their most beautiful exposition is found in the following story of the ancient **Canon:**
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kauśāmbī (Pa **Kosambi)**
in a śiṃśapā (Pa siṃsapā) grove. Then the Blessed One took up a few śiṃśapā leaves in his hand and addressed the monks thus: "What do you think, monks, which is more numerous: these few śiṃśapā leaves that I **have** taken up in my hand or those in the śiṃśapā grove **overhead?"**
"Venerable sir, the śiṃśapā leaves that the Blessed One has **taken** up in his hand are few, but those in the śiṃśapā grove overhead are **numerous."**
"So, too, monks, the things I have directly known but have not **taught**
you are numerous, while the things I have taught you are few. And **why,**
monks, have I not taught those many things? Because they are **unbeneficial,** irrelevant to the fundamentals of holy life, and do not lead to **aversion,** to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to **enlightenment,** to Nirvāṇa (Pa *nibb*āna). Therefore I have not taught **them.**
"And what, monks, have I taught? I have taught: 'This is **suffering';** I
have taught: 'This is the origin of suffering'; I have taught: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; I have taught: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of **suffering'.**21 The topic of liberation from suffering is never contradicted in the Buddhist **texts.**22 We conclude from this that it constituted a main theme of the teaching of the Buddha. It is often presented as part of a list, the Four Noble Truths. This may be due to the influence of later scholastics. But this later influence concerned the **form,** not the content: the Buddha taught a method to put an end to **suffering.**
The so-called first sermon of the Blessed One contains the **following**
explanation of these Four Noble **Truths:**
This, O monks, is the noble truth of *suffering*: Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, to be united with the unloved is suffering, to be separated from the loved is suffering, not to obtain what one desires is suffering, in short the five-fold clinging (to the earthly) is **suffering.**
This, O monks, is the noble truth of the *origin of suffering*: it is the thirst **(for**
being) which leads from birth to birth, together with lust and desire, **which** finds gratification here and there: the thirst for pleasures, the thirst for **being,** the thirst for **non-existence.**
This, O monks, is the noble truth of the *cessation of suffering*: the **cessation**
of this thirst by the complete annihilation of desire, letting it go, expelling it, separating oneself from it, giving it no **room.**
This, O monks, is the noble truth of the *path which leads to the cessation of* suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path, to wit: Right Faith, Right **Resolve,**
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Living, Right Effort, Right **Thought,**
Right **Concentration.**23 This explanation still lacks clarity. The Noble Eightfold Path, in **particular,** provides no details of the method taught by the Buddha. The canonical **texts** fortunately contain a more detailed description of the path to liberation, **which** is repeated at several **places:**
Here a Buddha (tathā*gata*) appears in the world, accomplished (*arhat*, Pa arahaṃ), fully enlightened (samyaksaṃbuddha, Pa sammāsaṃ*buddha*),
perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime (*sugata*), knower of **worlds,**
incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and **humans,**
venerable (*bhagavat*), blessed. He teaches this world with its **gods** (*sadevaka*), its Māras (samā*raka*), and its Brahmās (*sabrahmaka*), **this**
generation with its recluses and Brahmins, its princes and its people, **what** he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He preaches the teaching **that** is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life (*brahmacarya*, Pa brahmacariya) that is utterly perfect and **pure.**
A householder or householder's son or one born in some other **clan**
hears that teaching. On hearing the teaching he acquires faith (ś*raddh*ā, Pa saddhā) in the Buddha. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: **'Household** life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth (pravrajyā, Pa *pabbajj*ā) is **wide**
open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life **utterly** perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and **beard,** put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into **homelessness.'**
 

23 This explanation is found in the Vinaya of the Theravādins (Vin I.10), of the Mahīśāsakas (TI 1421, vol. 22, p. 104b line 23 - p. 104c line 7), and of the Dharmaguptakas (TI 1428, vol. 22, p. 788a lines 9-20); these passages have all **been**
translated into French by Bareau (1963: 172-176). The translation from the Pāli **presented**
here has been taken from Oldenberg, 1971: 211 f. (modified).

On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a large fortune, **abandoning** a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, **puts** on the yellow robe, and goes forth from the home life into **homelessness.**
Having thus gone forth and possessing the monk's training and way of life, abandoning the killing of living **beings** (prāṇātipāta, Pa pāṇātipāta),
he abstains from killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid **aside,** gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. **Abandoning**
the taking of what has not been given (adattādāna, Pa *adinn*ādāna), he abstains from taking what has not been given; taking only what has **been** given, expecting only what has been given, by not stealing he **abides** in purity. Abandoning unchastity (abrahmacarya, Pa *abrahmacariya*), he observes celibacy, living apart, abstaining from the vulgar practice of **sexual**
intercourse. Abandoning false **speech** (mṛṣāvāda, Pa musāvāda), he **abstains**
from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of the world. Abandoning malicious **speech**
(piśunā vāk, Pa *pisu*ṇā vācā), he abstains from malicious speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those **people]** from these, nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard **elsewhere** in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who **reunites** those who are divided, a promoter of friendships, who enjoys **concord,** rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that **promote**
concord. Abandoning harsh speech (paruṣā vāk, Pa *pharus*ā vācā), he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle, **pleasing** to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many and agreeable to many. Abandoning gossip (*sambhinnapral*āpa, Pa samphappalāpa), he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right time, **speaks**
what is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Teaching (*dharma*, Pa dhamma) and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and **beneficial.**
He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He practises eating **only**
in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the **proper** time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical **shows.** He abstains from wearing garlands, smartening himself with scent, and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and **large** couches. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains **from** accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains **from** accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and **women** slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains **from** accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants, **cattle,** horses, and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land. He **abstains** from going on errands and running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights, false metals, and false **measures.** He abstains from cheating, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He **abstains** from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and **violence.**
He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with **almsfood**
to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only **these** with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its **only** burden, so too the monk becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble **virtue**
(śīlaskandha, Pa sī*lakkhandha*), he experiences within himself a bliss **that** is blameless.

On seeing a form (rūpa) with the eye, he does not grasp at its **signs**
and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil **unwholesome** states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound (ś*abda*) with the ear [...] On smelling an **odour** (*gandha*) with the nose [...] On tasting a flavour (*rasa*) with the tongue **[...]** On touching a tangible (spraṣṭ*avya*) with the body [...] On **cognizing** a mental property24 (dharma, Pa *dhamma*) with the mind (*manas*), he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty **unguarded,**
evil (pā*paka*) unwholesome (akuśala, Pa *akusala*) states of **covetousness**
(abhidhyā, Pa *abhijjh*ā) and grief (daurmanasya, Pa *domanassa*) **might**
invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the mind **faculty,** he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this **noble** restraint of the faculties, he experiences within himself a bliss **that** is unsullied.

He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking **away;** who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who **acts** in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming **food,** and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, **waking** up, talking, and keeping **silent.**
Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble **restraint** of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and full **awareness,** he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a **mountain,** a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open **space,** a heap of straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits **down,** folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and **establishing**
mindfulness (smṛti, Pa *sati*) before **him.**
Abandoning covetousness (abhidhyā, Pa *abhijjh*ā) for the **world,** he abides with a mind (*cetas*) free from covetousness; he purifies his **mind** (*citta*) from covetousness. Abandoning ill will (vyāpāda) and **hatred**
(pradveṣa, Pa *padosa*), he abides with a mind free from ill **will,**
compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind **from**
ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth (styāna, Pa thīna) and torpor (*middha*),
he abides free from sloth and torpor, having clear **consciousness**
(ālokasaṃ*jñin*), mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness (auddhatya, Pa *uddhacca*) and **remorse**
(kaukṛtya, Pa *kukkucca*), he abides unagitated with a mind **inwardly**
peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. **Abandoning**
doubt (vicikitsā, Pa *vicikicch*ā), he abides having gone beyond **doubt,**
unperplexed (akathaṃ*kathin*) about wholesome mental properties (kuś**ala** 
dharma); he purifies his mind from **doubt.**
Having thus abandoned these five hindrances (nī*vara*ṇa) and the secondary defilements (upakleśa, Pa *upakkilesa*), quite secluded **from**
sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome mental properties (akuś*ala* dharma), he enters upon and abides in the first stage of meditation (dhyāna, Pa jhāna), which is accompanied by deliberation (*vitarka*) and **reflection**
(vicāra), with pleasure (prīti) and joy (*sukha*) born of seclusion (*vivekaja*).

Again, with the stilling of deliberation and reflection, a monk **enters**
upon and abides in the second stage of meditation, which has internal **quiet**
(adhyātmasaṃprasāda, Pa ajjhattaṃ sampasā*dana*ṃ) and singleness of **mind** (cetasa ekotībhāva˙, Pa *cetaso ekodibh*āvo) without deliberation and reflection, with pleasure and joy born of concentration (samā*dhija*).

Again, with the fading away as well of pleasure, a monk **abides** in equanimity (upekṣaka, Pa *upekkhaka*), and mindful (smṛtimat, Pa *sata*) and fully aware (saṃprajānat, Pa *sampaj*āna), still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third stage of meditation, on **account**
of which the noble ones (ārya, Pa *ariya*) announce: 'He has a **pleasant**
abiding who has equanimity and is **mindful.'**
Again, with the abandoning of joy (*sukha*) and suffering (du˙kha),
and with the previous disappearance of joy (saumanasya, Pa *somanassa*) and grief (daurmanasya, Pa *domanassa*), a monk enters upon and abides in the fourth stage of meditation, which has neither-suffering-nor-joy and **purity** of mindfulness due to equanimity (upekṣāsmṛtipariś*uddhi*, Pa upekkhāsatipā*risuddhi*).25 This part of the description of the path to liberation may coincide, in its **contents,**
with what was taught by the historical Buddha. Its precise *form*, on the other **hand,**
may owe its origin to the influence of later scholasticism, especially there **where**
lists are involved, such as the Five Hindrances, the Four Stages of Meditation, **etc.**26 The description of the third stage of meditation, moreover, cannot in this **form** go back to the historical Buddha himself, as it contains the phrase: "on **account** of which the noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.'" The noble ones can only be Buddhists, as there is no evidence that the path of the Four Stages of Meditation existed before the historical Buddha. **Since,** then, this description quotes earlier Buddhists, we have to assume that it was **given** its final form by later Buddhists. Contentwise we may look upon it as, by and **large,** original.

The concluding part of the description, presented below, requires **more**
caution. It describes the insights that are acquired at the moment of **liberation.** These insights are the most important items of knowledge there are in **Buddhism.** They were soon regarded as the essence of the Buddhist teaching. Not **surprisingly,** whatever came to be looked upon at any time as most important in the **Buddhist** teaching was subsequently claimed to have been discovered by the Buddha at the time of his liberation. We will return to this issue in a following chapter. **Here** we shall present the concluding part of the above description, leaving out **portions**
which the comparison of different versions has identified as later **additions:**27 When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to **imperturbability,** he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints (āsravakṣ*ayajñ*āna, Pa ā*savakkayañ*āṇa). He understands as it actually is: 'This is suffering'; **[...]**
'This is the origin of suffering'; [...] 'This is the cessation of suffering'; **[...]** 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering'; [...] 'These are the taints'; [...] 'This is the origin of the taints'; [...] 'This is the cessation of the taints'; [...] 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the **taints.'**
When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the **taint** of desire (kāmāsrava, Pa kāmā*sava*), from the taint of being (bhavā*srava*, Pa bhavā*sava*), and from the taint of ignorance (avidyāsrava, Pa avijjā*sava*).28 When [the mind] is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'I am **liberated.'**29 He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, so that I will not again return **here.'**30 This passage shows that liberation takes place during the practitioner's **lifetime,** and not at the moment of death. Other passages confirm this. The goal of the religious life is repeatedly described as attainable in this life and even as **'not**
connected with death'.31 However, not all texts agree on this point. We shall **review** the passages that link liberation to death **later.**32 The most problematic part of the passage just presented deals with **liberating**
knowledge. We shall see later that it is here in particular that ideas that **were** originally alien to Buddhism found their way in. This has to do with the fact **that** at the beginning of its development Buddhism was subject to strong influence **from** other movements. This explains various features of the ancient texts. We now **turn** to this **topic.**

## Self And Liberating Knowledge

The ancient texts tell us that the Buddha went to various teachers before his enlightenment, as part of his search for the end of suffering - Ārāḍa Kālāma and Udraka Rāmaputra are mentioned by name. On each occasion he rejected **their**
teachings after examination.33 After his enlightenment he was - again **according** to the ancient discourses - frequently involved in discussions with people who **held** other opinions. This suggests that the Buddha shared certain opinions with **other** teachers of his time. It is also likely that he proclaimed new teachings which **went** beyond these shared opinions. We will first delineate the common background, and then discuss some important differences that the Buddhist texts **themselves** emphasize. In the process we shall discover that there are some **non-Buddhist** teachings that have succeeded in exerting an influence on the **development** of Buddhist **teaching.**
The belief in rebirth features in the explanation of the Four Noble **Truths**
and in the path to liberation. It cannot be regarded as something new taught by the Buddha, because there are good reasons to think that he accepted it as **point** of departure for his quest. It is an important presupposition of his teaching. This is not surprising. We know that in India this belief was not restricted to **Buddhism.** We find it in various non-Buddhist movements such as Jainism and the old **Upanishads** of the Veda. It also seems certain that Jainism existed already before the time of the historical Buddha.34 He may also have been familiar with the contents of **some** Upanishads, or of parts of them.35 Our method, too, gives us no reasons to **doubt** that the founder of Buddhism held this belief.36 It follows that the belief in **rebirth**
existed when the Buddha started his career as a teacher. We may assume that for him rebirth was not only a certainty, but also an important part of the **problem** to which he believed to have found a **solution.**
The doctrine of rebirth as it is presupposed in the Buddhist texts, **however,** is not identical with what we find, for example, in the Jaina texts. Both religions **share** the idea that the actions of a person determine how he or she will be reborn, but they differ in the way these actions are understood. In Jainism actions are understood as concrete-physical; in Buddhism intention (*cetan*ā) also plays a **role:**
"Monks, I say that intention is action. It is with a certain intention that one **acts,**
whether with body, speech, or mind."37 This is understandable. The second **noble**
truth says of thirst, i.e. desire, that it leads from birth to birth. Desire and **intention** are closely related. Actions, on the other hand, may result from intention - and therefore desire - but they do not have to.

This may explain the apparent difference between the Four Noble **Truths**
and the account quoted above of the path to liberation. In the Four Noble **Truths,** thirst, i.e. desire, is regarded as the cause of rebirth. According to the **path** to liberation, however, beings are reborn each in accordance with his **actions**
(*karman*). This difference confirms that karma is not conceived of as concretephysical in these texts, because it is thirst that drives humans to act. **Nevertheless,** on the basis of these and similar passages some scholars raise the question **whether**
karma played any role at all in the teaching of rebirth in early Buddhism.38 We **shall**
not occupy ourselves with this question, because our criterion is **contradiction** between passages, and there is none in this case, so that we have no **grounds** to exclude the belief in **karma.**39 Another point shared by Buddhism and some of the other teachings of the time is the search for liberation from the cycle of rebirths. Once again it has to be said that in this respect, too, the Buddha's teaching was not original. Nor do the Buddhist texts make any such claim. The novelty in the teaching of the **Buddha** is not the search for liberation or the belief in rebirth, but rather the specific **method** taught.

Not all of ancient India's religions were based on the two premises of **rebirth**
and search for liberation. The ancient and traditional religion of the **Brahmins** in particular, i.e. Vedic religion, had very different conceptions and goals. Rebirth and liberation belonged to a different, non-Vedic culture, which has not left us **much** in terms of scriptures, 40 but which exerted much influence at the time. The Upanishads, even though they are associated with the Veda, were **influenced** by these non-Vedic ideas: they contain an amalgam of Vedic thinking combined **with**
the belief in rebirth and the search for liberation.41 Buddhism clearly belongs to **that**
non-Vedic culture, even though its teachings differ considerably at times **from** other currents that belong to it.

The fact that Buddhism accepted the teaching of rebirth as a given **shows**
that it did not originate in a historic vacuum. The Buddha shared this belief with his contemporaries; the same is probably true of a number of other beliefs, **some** of which may remain unidentifiable. As we have seen, the Buddha also did not **invent** the search for liberation. The new element in his teaching is the method by **which** this goal is to be achieved. The Buddha's method is different from the **other** methods existing at his time. In order to understand in which **ways,** an understanding of certain non-Buddhist teachings and methods is necessary. The same is true when it comes to understanding passages in the Buddhist canon **which** criticize non-Buddhist methods, sometimes in ways that are not **immediately** obvious.

To illustrate this, we shall turn to a problem which has played an **important**
role, both in the later history of Buddhism and in modern scholarship, **where** it continues to do so. It concerns the question of a self in ancient Buddhism. **Most** later Buddhists in India simply denied the existence of a self. We will **occupy** ourselves with this position later on. Here we have to deal with the **question** whether or not the ancient discourses actually deny the existence of a self. **Modern** scholars studying the passages in question have come to different **conclusions:**
some believe that ancient Buddhism did not deny a self,42 others believe **that** it did.43 Instead of examining the controversy, we shall have a look at some of the passages concerned and try to interpret them in the light of what we know of the time of the Buddha. The most important of these passages is supposed to **preserve** the words which the Buddha addressed to his first five disciples shortly after his enlightenment:
And the Exalted One spake to the five monks **thus:**
"Material form (rūpa), O monks, is not the self (anātman, Pa *anatt*ā).44 If material form were the self, O monks, material form could not be **subject** to sickness, and a man should be able to say regarding his material **form:** my body shall be so and so; my body shall not be so and so. But **inasmuch,** O monks, as material form is not the self, therefore material form is **subject** to sickness, and a man cannot say as regards his material form: my body **shall** be so and so; my body shall not be so and so.

"The sensations (*vedan*ā), O monks, are not the self [...]" - and then the very same exposition which has been given regarding material **form** is repeated with regard to the sensations. Then comes the detailed **explanation**
regarding the remaining three aggregates (skandha, Pa *khandha*), the ideations (saṃjñā, Pa *saññ*ā), the conditioned **factors** (saṃskāra, Pa saṃkhāra), consciousness (vijñāna, Pa *viññ*āṇa). Then the Buddha **goes** on to **say:** "What think ye then, O monks, is material form **permanent** or impermanent?" "Impermanent, **sire."** "But is that which is impermanent, sorrow or **joy?"** "Sorrow, **sire."** "But if a man duly considers that which is impermanent, full of **sorrow,** subject to change, can he say: that is mine, that is I, that is my **self?"** "Sire, he **cannot."** Then follows the same exposition in similar terms regarding **sensations,** ideations, conditioned factors, and consciousness: after which the **discourse** proceeds: "Therefore, O monks, whatever in the way of material form **(sensations,** ideations, etc.) has ever been, will be, or is, either in us or in the **outer** world, whether strong or weak, low or high, far or near, it is not the self: **this** he must in truth perceive, who possesses real knowledge. **Whosoever** regards things in this light, O monks, being a wise and noble hearer of the word, turns away from material form, turns away from sensation and ideation, from conditioned factor and consciousness. When he turns **away** from them, he becomes free from desire; by the cessation of **desire** he obtains deliverance; when [the mind] is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'I am liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the **holy** life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, so that I will not again return **here.'"**45
 

44 Oldenberg translates *anatt*ā "not the self", Bareau "dépourvu de soi", that is **"without**
self". We will discuss these two possible interpretations below. Here it must suffice to say that the context in this passage supports Oldenberg's **interpretation.**
45 This passage is found in the Vinaya of the Theravādins (Vin I pp. 13-14), in the **Vinaya**
of the Mahīśāsaka (TI 1421, vol. 22, p. 105a lines 15-24) and in the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka (TI 1428, vol. 22, p. 789a line 12 - p. 789b line 1), and elsewhere, for example SN III.67 f.; see also SN III.48 f. etc. (for further references see Oetke, 1988: 8889 and 105; Pérez-Remón, 1980: 158 ff.). The various Vinaya versions have **been** translated into French by Bareau (1963: 191 f.). We shall follow Oldenberg's (1971: 213 ff.) paraphase, modified.

We cannot tell with certainty, on the basis of this passage, whether the **existence** of a self is denied or not. It is not explicitly denied; there is no statement to the **effect** that 'the self does not exist'. All that is said is that the Five Aggregates **which** constitute the physical and mental basis of a human being are not the **self.** However, we can learn something else from this passage. Regardless of its existence or non-existence, a specific *concept* of the self presents itself: the self **that**
is being talked about is permanent, joyful and not subject to change. **Furthermore,** it is clear from this passage that knowledge of the self is not the path to **liberation.** On the contrary, liberation is achieved by turning away from what might **erroneously** be regarded as the **self.**
Outside Buddhism, knowledge of the self was often recognized in **ancient**
India as being the principal means to achieving liberation. This self, **whose** knowledge was sought in those non-Buddhist circles, was described in the **same** terms which we also meet in this Buddhist passage: it is permanent, not **subject** to change and often joyful. This cannot be a coincidence. Buddhism **originated** at a time when a number of individuals and religious currents occupied themselves **with** the problem how to escape from the cycle of rebirths. Most of these individuals and currents had in common that they believed that rebirth is determined by **actions**
(*karman*) performed in a previous life. They concluded from this that one **must**
either suppress all actions, or discover that the core of the human (or even nonhuman) being, its true self, has no part in these actions and is, therefore, **permanent**
and not subject to **change.**46 We shall deal later with the adherents of ascetic movements who **tried** to suppress, fully or in part, their bodily and mental activities. Here we are **interested** in those currents in which knowledge of the true self was looked upon as the primary condition for liberation, for these will enable us to correctly evaluate the passage from the Buddhist canon quoted above. They find expression, in the **early**
period, primarily in the Upanishads and in the great epic, the Mahābhā*rata*. It is not impossible, though far from certain, that the Buddha was familiar with the **contents**
of some Upanishads or of some of their parts, and perhaps with other Vedic **texts.**47 In the Bṛhadāraṇ*yaka Upani*ṣad (4.4.20), for example, it is said: "The **self** is unborn, great and permanent". The Maitrāyaṇī *Upani*ṣad (2.7) and the Śvetāś*vatara* Upaniṣad (1.9) emphasize the inactivity of the self. (We have already indicated **that**
it is likely that the Upanishads borrowed these ideas from other, **non-Vedic** movements.) The joyful nature of the self, too, is mentioned in the old **Brahmanical**
texts. What defines the self is joy and bliss (ā*nanda*), we read in the *Taittir*īya Upaniṣad (2.5). The same is said about Brahman in the Bṛhadāraṇ*yaka Upani*ṣad
(3.9.28), and the often mentioned identity of Brahman with the self need not be repeated **here.**
All this shows that the passage quoted above criticizes first and **foremost** an alternative method of liberation. The fact that in the Buddhist texts this view of the self is sometimes explicitly attributed to others confirms this. We read, for example, of ascetics and Brahmins who regard that which is pleasant in the **world,**
as permanent, joyful, the self, free of illness and at ease.48 These ascetics and Brahmins commit a mistake, it is added, because in this way thirst, i.e. **desire,** becomes stronger. Another passage is worth quoting for its humorous **comparison.** It is put in the mouth of the **Buddha:**
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that **after** death the self is entirely happy and free from disease. I approached them and asked if this was indeed what they declared and believed, and they **replied:** "Yes." Then I said: "Do you, friends, living in the world, know and see it as an entirely happy place?" and they replied: "No." I said: "Have you **ever** experienced a single night or day, or half a night or day, that was **entirely** happy?" and they replied "No." [...] It is just as if a man were to **say:** "I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country." **They** might say to him: "Well, as to this most beautiful girl in the country, do you know whether she belongs to the Kṣatriya, the Brahmin, the merchant or the artisan class?" and he would say: "No." Then they might say: "Well, do you know her name, her clan, whether she is tall or short or of medium **height,** whether she is dark or light-complexioned or sallow-skinned, or **what** village or town or city she comes from?" and he would say: "No." And **they** might say: "Well then, you don't know or see the one you seek for and desire?" and he would say: "No." Does not the talk of that man turn out to be **stupid?**49 The aim of the teaching of the Buddha is evidently not to discover the real self. The insight that the self does not play a part in the activities of body and mind does not help to attain liberation. On the contrary, the preoccupation with the true **nature** of the self has to be given up. Only then one is ready to follow the path shown by the Buddha.50 Seen from this practical point of view, the question as to the **existence** of the self is of minor importance. The main thing is that knowledge of the self **plays**
no useful role on the Buddha's path to liberation. Let us recall at this point that the self, in certain non-Buddhist circles, was looked upon as being permanent and not subject to change because only knowledge of such a self could be useful to the attainment of liberation. In view of this fact, it is probably justified to assume **that**
the Buddha did not accept the existence of such a **self.**51 Note that the passage quoted above is not only negative. Acquiring the insight that the various components of the person are not the self causes a wise and noble listener to turn away from material form, etc.; as a result he becomes **free** from desire and attains liberation. In this way the criticism of other, **non-Buddhist** paths serves a positive purpose. The rejection of the liberating knowledge of **others** becomes itself a liberating knowledge. This will be discussed in more detail **below.**
In the passage on the non-self it is stated that the Five Aggregates (*skandha*,
Pa *khandha*) - that is material form (rūpa), sensations (*vedan*ā), **ideations** (saṃjñā, Pa *saññ*ā), conditioned factors (saṃskāra, Pa saṃkhāra), and **consciousness**
(vijñāna, Pa *viññ*āṇa) - are not the self. We are confronted here with a **concept** of the person which should not be confused with the concept of the self, and **which** seems natural to assume that the Five Aggregates are all there is to a person. **This,**
at any rate, is how the later Buddhists understood it. The person (*pudgala*, Pa puggala), seen this way, is a conglomerate of these aggregates. It is **impossible** to determine whether the aggregates, and the analysis of the person based on, or inspired by, them, was part of the original teaching of the Buddha or not. One **could** conceive of the path to liberation described so far without the assumption of the aggregates, but they are, as far as I am aware, never criticized in the ancient **texts.**52 One thing however is certain, viz., that the list of aggregates became **extremely** important for the later development of the teaching; this will be shown below. The same is true of other lists in the ancient discourses. Take another look at the following passage from the description of the path to liberation quoted above: "On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and features. **[...]** On hearing a sound with the ear [...] On smelling an odour with the nose [...] On **tasting** a flavour with the tongue [...] On touching a tangible with the body **[...]** On cognizing a mental property with the mind, he does not grasp at its signs and features." This passage describes how the monk must behave with regard to the objects of his sense organs. It also contains a list of the sense organs and **sense**
objects. These are the eye (cakṣus) and form (rūpa), the ear (ś*rotra*) and **sound**
(ś*abda*), the nose (ghrāṇa) and odour (*gandha*), the tongue (*jihv*ā) and **flavour**
(*rasa*), the body (kāya) and the tangible (spraṣṭ*avya*), the mind (*manas*) and the mental property (*dharma*). Altogether these are six pairs, or twelve **realms** (ā*yatana*), which is the designation by which they are known in the Buddhist **texts**
and gain in importance. An extension of this list is the one of Eighteen **Elements**
(dhātu). It contains not only the above six sense organs and six sense objects, but also the six corresponding classes of consciousness: **eye-consciousness**
(cakṣ*urvijñ*āna), ear-consciousness (ś*rotravijñ*āna), **nose-consciousness** (ghrāṇ*avijñ*āna), tongue-consciousness (jihvā*vijñ*āna), **body-consciousness** (kā*yavijñ*āna), and mind-consciousness (*manovijñ*āna).

We are now ready to deal with the problem of liberating **knowledge.** We have seen that, during the formation of Buddhism, knowledge of the **self** constituted a path to liberation that competed with Buddhism. This **path** to liberation was close to Buddhism in that it, too, had liberation from the **cycle** of rebirths as its aim. The early Buddhists were familiar with this other path, and **they** were inevitably confronted with the question as to what constituted the **liberating** knowledge of the Buddhist path. This question was all the more important **because** there was one further important religious tradition at the time which, even **though** it did not accept liberation from rebirth as a goal, nevertheless gave great **importance** to insight. This was Vedic religion. In Vedic literature, especially in the **so-called** Brāhmaṇas, mention is often made of the power of knowledge, particularly in the context of the magical identifications which are common there.53 A few **examples**
must suffice to illustrate this. We read, for example, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
(1.5.1): "The one who desires energy or Brahmanic illustriousness should [...] use the two gā*yatr*ī stanzas. The gā*yatr*ī is energy and Brahmanic **illustriousness.**
Energetic and illustrious does he become who *knowing thus* uses the two gā*yatr*ī stanzas."54 The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa (1.122) contains the following **passage:** "Rūra
[...], desiring cattle, performed austerities. He saw this melody (sāman). He **praised** with it. He used this (word) iÒā (as finale). IÒā means cattle. Then he **obtained**
cattle. Therefore this melody procures cattle. *He who knows this* obtains cattle and becomes rich in cattle. And because Rūra [...] saw it, therefore also it is **called**
Raurava."55 From the same Brāhmaṇa (JB 1.11) we learn the following: **"When**
now he offers these two morning-oblations, [the sun] lifts him up by means of **these** two. As an elephant rises together with him who is sitting on the **elephant-seat,** so this deity rises together with him who offers *knowing thus*. It makes him go to its own world of which there is none supreme. Whatever is beyond the sun, **that** is immortality. That he wins."56 And again: "*He who knows* the 'divine' chariot **comes**
into possession of a chariot. The 'divine' chariot is sacrifice."57 In the **next**
example, this one from the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (3.11.8.7-8), a connection **between**
persons and things is 'etymologically' established: "Prajāpati (the creator god) did
(dakṣiṇa˙). He took it, speaking the ritual formula (*mantra*): 'For fitness (dakṣa) I take you, the sacrificial fee (dakṣiṇā).' - Therefore he became fit (adakṣata). The one who *knowing thus* receives the sacrificial fee (dakṣiṇā), becomes fit
(dakṣate)."58 There are numerous examples of this kind in Vedic literature. **They**
show that the Vedic religion also attributed great value to **knowledge.**
What was the liberating knowledge of the Buddhists? There are **indications**
that the Buddhists themselves were divided over this question. This is already **true** of the authors of the ancient discourses, which provide different answers. In the description of the path to liberation quoted above, we find the knowledge of the destruction of the taints (ā*srava*); in several versions the knowledge of past **lives**
and the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings are **added.** In the quoted passage on the non-self it is rather the knowledge that the **Five**
Aggregates (*skandha*) are not mine, not I and not my self, which leads to **liberation.**
Elsewhere it is the thought that the Five Aggregates appear and disappear, or the insight that the aggregates are empty, void and without substance, that lead to **this**
goal.59 In some texts doctrinal points that have meanwhile gained in **importance**
become part of the liberating knowledge. Examples are the **doctrines** of Conditioned Origination (pratī*tyasamutp*āda) and of the selflessness of the **person**
([pudgala-]nairā*tmya*).60 These will be discussed **below.**
If we examine more closely the knowledge of the destruction of the **taints** a number of irregularities become apparent.61 In the passage quoted above **this**
knowledge was described as follows: "He understands as it actually is: **'This** is suffering'; [...] 'This is the origin of suffering'; [...] 'This is the **cessation** of suffering'; [...] 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering'; [...] **'These** are the taints'; [...] 'This is the origin of the taints'; [...] 'This is the cessation of the taints'; [...] 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.' When he **knows**
and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of desire (kāmā*srava*, Pa kāmā*sava*), from the taint of being (bhavāsrava, Pa bhavā*sava*), and from the **taint**
of ignorance (avidyāsrava, Pa avijjā*sava*)." This knowledge includes the **Four**
Noble Truths, which are presented here as the liberating knowledge. But **these** same Four Noble Truths are also the content of the first sermon delivered by the Buddha after his enlightenment, if we can trust the tradition on this point.62 **This**
means, no doubt, that it was considered that these truths could motivate a **listener** to enter the path to liberation. They cannot therefore constitute the **liberating** knowledge that manifests itself at the end of this **path.**
There is something else. In several versions of the first sermon the **Buddha**
explains to the group of five disciples how, at his enlightenment, he had **fully**
realized the Four Noble Truths which comprise three 'turnings' (*parivarta*) - **i.e.,**
of the wheel of the doctrine - and twelve aspects (ākāra), four for each **turning:**63
- The first 'turning': 1. this is suffering; 2. this is the origin of suffering; 3. **this** is the cessation of suffering; 4. this is the path leading to the cessation of **suffering** - The second 'turning': 5. suffering must be fully known; 6. its origin **must** be destroyed; 7. its destruction must be accomplished; 8. the path leading to its destruction must be **travelled.** - The third 'turning': 9. suffering has been fully known; 10. its origin has **been** destroyed; 11. its destruction has been accomplished; 12. the path leading to its destruction has been **travelled.**
These explanations are probably later additions.64 But it is in this form that the **texts**
portray knowledge of the Four Noble Truths as liberating knowledge, for **they** continue: "O monks, as soon as the [pure] eye that sees the Four Noble Truths **with** its three turnings and twelve aspects arose, along with the certainty, the **knowledge** Māras and its Brahmas, from its human beings with their ascetics and **their** Brahmins. I established myself firmly in the state of mind which is free **from** confusions, and from that moment, o monks, I knew that I had attained the **highest** and perfect enlightenment." This shows that there were Buddhists for whom the Four Noble Truths as such could not be the liberating knowledge. What led the Buddha to his enlightenment was rather the knowledge of the first truth, the destruction (of the content) of the second truth, the realization of the third **truth,**
and the practice of the fourth **truth.**65 It has already been observed that the interest of the early Buddhists in **some**
form of liberating knowledge can easily be explained with reference to the religious milieu of the time. The vacillating attitude of the texts with regard to the exact content of this knowledge gives rise to the suspicion that the early **Buddhist** tradition had little or nothing to offer in this respect. That would not be **surprising.** In the above quoted description of the path to liberation, a number of **meditative,** one might say mystical states are depicted that precede the liberating **knowledge;** this knowledge is therefore attained in such a state. It is however known **that** mystical states cannot always be accurately described in words. Perhaps the **oldest** tradition did not talk about a liberating knowledge at all, or, if it did, it talked **about** a knowledge without specifying its content. This latter suspicion is **supported** by the fact that in some versions of the first sermon - probably the older ones - the Four Noble Truths or other forms of liberating knowledge are not mentioned at **all.** The Buddha is here portrayed as someone who teaches his disciples in **private.** Liberating knowledges, or any other knowledges for that matter, are not formulated.66 In most versions of the first sermon the listeners are five monks. In the versions belonging to the Vinaya-piṭaka, these five monks attain the goal of the teaching, viz., liberation from the taints, during the second sermon of the **Buddha.**67 That is to say, like the Buddha, the five monks become Arhats. We have **already** come across this second sermon, that is so important for the five monks. It is the discourse on the non-self, whose most important parts have been quoted **above.In** that connection we have also pointed out that the knowledge of the **non-self** is regarded there as liberating knowledge. Now we see that this liberating **knowledge** enabled the five monks to become Arhats while still listening to the **sermon.**
It is difficult to conceive of a starker contrast than the one between the **path**
to liberation as discussed above and the process of liberation described here. In the preceding account liberation was attained in solitude, in a mystical state, and presumably without the help of knowledge formulated in words. In the present one it suffices to listen to the liberating knowledge, in the presence of others, in **order** to immediately become an Arhat. This contrast shows that various ideas about the path to liberation found a place side by side in the ancient Buddhist **texts.**
The same contrast also appears elsewhere in the Buddhist discourses, and plays a significant role in the further development of Buddhism. The **famous** Belgian scholar Louis de la Vallée Poussin emphasized this in 1937 in an **important**
article, which draws attention to two monks, called Musīla and Nārada.68 In a Sūtra of the Saṃyutta-Nikāya / Saṃyuktā*gama*69 first Musīla is questioned about his spiritual state. It becomes clear that he knows through his own knowledge and insight the causal relationships found in the chain of 'Conditioned **Origination'**
(pratītyasamutpāda, Pa paṭ*iccasamupp*āda, to be discussed below). He knows **from**
the same source that the cessation of becoming is Nirvāṇa. If this is true, the questioner concludes, the venerable Musīla is an Arhat, one whose taints are destroyed. Musīla's silence betrays his agreement with this. Next Nārada **asks** to be questioned in the same way. He answers the same questions in exactly the **same** words. He rejects however the conclusion that he is an Arhat, one whose taints are destroyed. He explains this with the help of a simile. Just as when a man who is hot contains water, but alas, he cannot reach and touch the water. In the same way he, Nārada, even though he knows that the cessation of becoming is **Nirv**āṇa, is no Arhat, and his taints have not been **destroyed.**
As said before, the contrast between the two processes of liberation is too pronounced to go unnoticed. It makes a great deal of difference **whether** enlightenment is only to be found in the solitude of the forest, in a mystical **state** induced by meditation exercises, or, alternatively, by means of the **attainment** of certain knowledges, possibly in the company of other people. It is even more **telling** that the Buddhists themselves do not know who is an Arhat and who is **not.** In Musīla's case the texts give the impression that he maintains in good faith **that** he is an Arhat. The Sūtra does not state that he was wrong. It does, however, state **that,** under the same circumstances, Nārada did not consider himself to be an **Arhat.**
We have repeatedly pointed out that the presence in the Buddhist **texts** of a liberating knowledge that can be expressed in words can, without **difficulty,** be explained by the important role which such items of knowledge played in **several** non-Buddhist religious movements of the time. This is particularly clear in the **case** of the liberating knowledge of the non-self. This knowledge, as we have **seen,** is expressed in the following words: "Therefore, O monks, whatever in the way of material form (sensations, ideations, etc., respectively) has ever been, will be, or is, either in us or in the outer world, whether strong or weak, low or high, far or **near,** it is not the self: this he must in truth perceive, who possesses real **knowledge.** Whosoever regards things in this light, O monks, being a wise and noble **hearer** of the word, turns away from material form, turns away from sensation and **ideation,** from conditioned factor and consciousness. When he turns away from **them,** he becomes free from desire; by the cessation of desire he obtains deliverance; **when** [the mind] is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'I am **liberated.'** He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be **done** has been done, so that I will not again return here.'" The non-identity of the **person** with anything that is involved in actions is here emphasized. This hardly **differs** from the knowledge of the self of certain non-Buddhists. Their self was that **part** of the person which does not participate in actions. Seen this way, this **liberating** knowledge of the Buddhists is hardly more than a mirror image of the liberating knowledge of the self of those non-Buddhists. In this case the Buddhist texts **have** not just borrowed the concept of a liberating knowledge expressible in words, **they**
have also borrowed its content from their **opponents.**70 It follows that the discrepancy mentioned above, which was noticed by the Buddhists themselves, need not be ascribed to the teaching of the **historical** Buddha. It is far more likely that, contrary to what happened later, no **explicitly** formulated liberating knowledge was part of the original teaching. This does not exclude that some kind of liberating knowledge may have played a **role** in Buddhism from the beginning. The texts frequently speak about *prajñ*ā (Pa *paññ*ā),
which may be translated as 'wisdom'. It is, for example, described as **follows:**71
"Right view (**samyagd**ṛṣṭi, Pa *samm*ādiṭṭhi), I say, is twofold: there is right **view**
that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening on the side of attachment; and there is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path. **[...]** And what, monks, is the right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a **factor**
of the path? The wisdom (prajñā, Pa *paññ*ā), the faculty of wisdom (*prajñendriya*,
Pa *paññindriya*), the power of wisdom (prajñābala, Pa paññā*bala*), the **means** of enlightenment through understanding the doctrine (dharmavicayasaṃ*bodhya*ṅga, Pa *dhammavicayasambojjha*ṅga)." It is not hard to imagine that the **occurrence** of this term in the oldest stratum of the tradition prompted attempts to define the precise content of this **'wisdom'.**72 For the modern scholar it is possible, as we have just **demonstrated,** to explain discrepancies in the canonical texts with the help of the assumption **that** non-Buddhist movements exercised an influence on Buddhist teaching. For a Buddhist, who takes the texts as the word of the Buddha, the situation is **different.** Discrepancies like the ones mentioned above require an explanation in his case **too,** but this explanation should not simply be a historical one. Only a **systematic** solution might be regarded as satisfactory by the tradition. It would have to **show** how the contradictory teachings are parts of a wider, more encompassing **vision,** in which they no longer contradict, but rather support and strengthen each **other.** It looks as if the doctrine of Conditioned Origination had a role to play **here.**
Let us examine the situation in more detail. If one believes that **there** is an item of knowledge that liberates human beings from the cycle of rebirths, or **even** from suffering itself, then clearly, the absence of this knowledge must be the **reason** why humanity finds itself in its sorry state. To phrase it differently: the **absence** of knowledge, or ignorance, is the original cause of rebirth and suffering. **This** is of course different from what we encountered in the Four Noble Truths. There it was thirst which was the root of all suffering and which had to be destroyed. How do thirst and ignorance relate to each other? The answer is found in the **doctrine** of Conditioned Origination which is expounded and explained in discourses **such** as the following **one:**
The Blessed One said this: "And what, monks, is Conditioned **Origination?**
With (1) ignorance (avidyā, Pa *avijj*ā) as condition, (2) conditioned **factors**
(saṃskāra, Pa saṅkhāra) [come to be]; with conditioned factors as **condition**
(3) consciousness (vijñāna, Pa *viññ*āṇa)
73; with consciousness as **condition,**
(4) name-and-form (nāmarūpa); with name-and-form as condition, (5) the six realms of the senses (ṣaḍāyatana, Pa saḻā*yatana)*; with the six **realms** of the senses as condition, (6) contact (sparśa, Pa *phassa*); with **contact** as condition, (7) sensation (*vedan*ā); with sensation as condition, (8) thirst, **i.e.**
craving (t*ṛṣṇā*, Pa taṇhā); with thirst as condition, (9) **clinging** (upādāna); with clinging as condition, (10) existence (*bhava*); with **existence** as condition, (11) birth (jāti); with birth as condition, (12) **aging-and-death,**
sorrow, lamentation, suffering, displeasure, and **despair**
(jarāmaraṇaśokaparidevadu˙*khadaurmanasyop*āyāsa, Pa jarāmaraṇ*asokaparidevadukkhadomanassup*āyāsa) come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of **suffering.**
And what, monks, is aging-and-death? The aging of the **various**
orders of beings, their growing old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of **hair,** wrinkling of skin, decline of vitality, degeneration of the faculties: **this** is called aging. The passing away of the various beings from the **various** orders of beings, their perishing, breakup, disappearance, mortality, **death,** completion of time, the break up of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this is called death. Thus this aging and this death are **together** called **aging-and-death.**
And what, monks, is birth? The birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent [into the **womb],** production, the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the **realms** of the senses. This is called **birth.**
And what, monks, is existence? There are these three **kinds** of existence: existence in the sphere of desire (kāma), existence in the **sphere**
of form (rūpa), existence in the sphere of non-form (arūpa). This is **called**
existence.

And what, monks, is clinging? There are these four kinds of **clinging:**
clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and **vows,** clinging to a doctrine of self. This is called **clinging.**
And what, monks, is thirst? There are these six classes of thirst: **thirst**
for forms, thirst for sounds, thirst for odours, thirst for flavours, thirst for tangibles, thirst for mental properties. This is called **thirst.**
And what, monks, is sensation? There are six classes of **sensation:**
sensation born of eye-contact, sensation born of ear-contact, sensation **born**
of nose-contact, sensation born of tongue-contact, sensation born of bodycontact, sensation born of mind-contact. This is called **sensation.**
And what, monks, is contact? There are six classes of contact: eyecontact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mindcontact. This is called **contact.**
And what, monks, are the six realms of the senses? The eye **realm,**
ear realm, nose realm, tongue realm, body realm, mind realm. These are called the six realms of the **senses.**
And what, monks, is name-and-form? Sensation, ideation, **volition,**
contact, attention: this is called name. The four great elements and the **form** derived from the four great elements: this is called form. Thus this name and this form are together called **name-and-form.**
And what, monks, is consciousness? There are six **classes** of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, **nose-consciousness,** tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. **This** is called **consciousness.**
And what, monks, are the conditioned factors? There are these **three**
kinds of conditioned factors: the bodily conditioned factor, the **verbal** conditioned factor, the mental conditioned factor. These are called the conditioned **factors.**
And what, monks, is ignorance? Not knowing suffering, not **knowing**
the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not **knowing** the path leading to the cessation of suffering. This is called **ignorance.**
Thus, monks, with ignorance as condition conditioned factors **[come**
to be]; with conditioned factors as condition consciousness [...] Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless **fading** away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of conditioned **factors;** with the cessation of conditioned factors, cessation of consciousness; **with** the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of the six realms of the senses; with the cessation of the six realms of the senses comes cessation of **contact;** with the cessation of contact comes the cessation of sensation; with the cessation of sensation comes the cessation of thirst; with the **cessation** of thirst, comes the cessation of clinging, with the cessation of clinging **comes** the cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence come the **cessation** of birth; with the cessation of birth comes the cessation of **aging-and-death,** sorrow, lamentation, suffering, displeasure, and despair. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of **suffering.**74 In this enumeration ignorance occurs at the beginning, thirst in the eighth **position.** This means that ignorance is a condition for all of the other elements in the enumeration, including thirst. And the destruction of thirst is only **possible** if ignorance is destroyed first. Therefore only subordinate importance can be assigned to the destruction of thirst, and the original path to liberation now becomes a relatively unimportant part of the new method, whose most **important**
part is the liberating **insight.**75 Despite its usefulness for the coherence of the teaching, this **enumeration** of the causal links of Conditioned Origination (pratī*tyasamutp*āda, Pa paṭ*iccasamupp*āda) poses great challenges to the understanding. Already in the ancient discourses it is described as very profound and difficult to **comprehend.**76 And when the disciple Ānanda believes that he has grasped the causal **sequence,**
the Buddha is reported to say to him:77 "Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say **that!**
This Conditioned Origination is profound and appears profound. It is through not understanding, not penetrating this doctrine that this generation has become **like** a tangled ball of string, covered as with a blight, tangled like coarse grass, **unable** to pass beyond states of woe, the ill destiny, ruin and the round of **birth-and-death."**
Probably the best modern attempt at explaining the chain of **conditions** is found in Erich Frauwallner's History of Indian Philosophy (*Geschichte der* indischen Philosophie). After a detailed analysis of the different elements of the chain, Frauwallner sums up his explanation in the following manner:78 **"The**
ultimate cause of entanglement in the cycle of existence is ignorance (*avidy*ā **(1)),**
i.e. the lack of acquaintance with the releasing knowledge, viz., the Four **Noble** Truths. For in the person who does not possess this knowledge, conditioned **factors**
(saṃskāra (2))79 originate which are directed at the sense-objects and the **earthly**
personality. Driven by these conditioned factors, consciousness (*vijñ*āna **(3)),**
which is, like a fine body, the carrier of rebirth, enters after death into a new womb. Connected with this consciousness, the body and the psychical **factors**
(name-and-form, nāmarūpa (4)) develop, and finally also the six realms of the senses (ṣaḍā*yatana* (5)) of the new being which in this way comes into **existence.**
When this new being is born, the fateful contact (*spar*śa (6)) of the sense **organs**
with their objects ensues. Sensations (*vedan*ā (7)) of different kinds arise and awaken the passions, above all **thirst** (t*ṛṣṇā* (8)), which clings (upādāna (9)) to the sense-pleasures and the supposed 'I', and leads, therethrough, to new bondage and a new existence (*bhava* (10)). Once again this leads to rebirth (jāti (11)) and entanglement in the sorrow of existence (jarā*mara*ṇa, etc. (12)), and this **goes** on in an endless chain, as long as the releasing knowledge and the destruction of **thirst** do not put an end to the **cycle."**
In this explanation - as in most others - the links of the chain are distributed over three lives. Two rebirths are depicted, but in very different **ways.** This somewhat strange state of affairs is best explained with the **help** of Frauwallner's assumption that the chain with twelve links is the result of a **fusion**
of two different chains.80 The second part, from thirst (8) to old age, dying, **etc.**
(12), is contentwise merely an elaboration of the basic idea of the Four **Noble**
Truths: old age, dying, etc. (12), i.e. suffering, are conditioned by birth (jāti) **(11)**
and new existence (*bhava*) (10) and have as their cause **thirst** (t*ṛṣṇā*) (8) on **account**
of clinging (upādāna) **(9).**81 The first part of the chain, from ignorance (1) to sensation (7), **describes**
how a new being is born. In this process consciousness (*vijñ*āna) is the **carrier**
which after death enters the next incarnation in the cycle of rebirths.82 One can indeed imagine that consciousness, driven by conditioned **factors** (saṃskāra),
enters into a new womb. Following this, a new body with mental factors (nameand-form, nāmarūpa) and realms of the senses (ṣaḍā*yatana*) develops, **which,**
through contact (*spar*śa) with outer objects, has sensations (*vedan*ā). The **main**
problem with regard to understanding this first part is to explain the **relationship**
between ignorance (*avidy*ā) and the conditioned factors (saṃskāra). It is not at all obvious that conditioned factors are conditioned by ignorance, or that the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths leads to the destruction of the **conditioned**
factors. Indeed, in a passage from the *Majjhima Nik*āya, taints (āsrava, Pa ā*sava*)
are put in the place of ignorance.83 Without ignorance the two parts of the **causal**
chain conflict less with each other, and describe more or less the same **thing,** though in different terms. The conditioned factors (or perhaps the taints) are now the original cause for rebirth in the first part, in the same way as thirst in the **second** part.

These thoughts on the original form and meaning of the causal chain are necessarily speculative. The main conclusion to be drawn is that we are not **likely** to learn much about the teaching of the Buddha from the doctrine of **Conditioned** Origination. In its classical form it is not part of the original teaching of the Buddha. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that one, perhaps even **both,** of its parts do not contradict the original teaching of the Buddha, the chain as a **whole** belongs to a time when attempts were made to reconcile new ideas about **liberating**
knowledge with the old **teaching.**84 In spite of this, the doctrine of Conditioned Origination became ever **more**
important. The ancient discourses already contain the following statement: **"One** who sees Conditioned Origination, sees the teaching, one who sees the **teaching,**
sees Conditioned Origination."85 We have also seen that some texts **present**
Conditioned Origination as the content of liberating knowledge. We will **come** across this doctrine again while dealing with further developments of the **teaching.**

## Asceticism And Meditation

The first sermon describes the Buddha's path to liberation as the Middle **Path:**86 "O
monks, one who has gone forth from worldly life should not indulge in these two extremes. What are the two? There is indulgence in desirable sense objects, **which** is low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, unworthy, and unprofitable and there is **devotion** to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable. O **monks,**
avoiding both these extremes, the Buddha (tathā*gata*) has realized the Middle **Path.**
It produces vision, it produces knowledge, it leads to calm, to higher **knowledge,** to enlightenment, to Nirvāṇa. And what is that Middle Path, O monks, that the Buddha has realized? It is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: Right **understanding,** right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, **right** mindfulness, and right concentration." It is reasonable to suppose that the expression "indulgence in desirable sense objects" does not characterize a **specific** religious movement that existed during the Buddha's life-time, but rather the common man, who does not "indulge in desirable sense objects" in order to **reach** a religious goal. However, the opposite extreme no doubt presupposes ascetics who used "devotion to self-mortification" as a method to reach a religious goal. It has been suggested that the doctrine of the Middle Path might reflect the legend of the life of the Buddha before his enlightenment: wasn't he born a prince, who lived for a long time a life of pleasure before dedicating himself to asceticism, **without**
getting anything useful out of either?87 Since this book deals with the **teachings** of Buddhism, not the life of its founder, there is no need to go into the **question** whether this legend is as old as the doctrine of the Middle **Path.** 
The Buddhist discourses contain many passages which show that the Buddha regularly came in contact with ascetics who dedicated themselves to selfmortification. In such passages, these ascetics are often Jainas - described in the sources as nirgrantha, Pa *niga*ṇṭha 'free from all ties or hindrances'88– who followed the instructions of the teacher Jñātṛputra (Pa Nāt(h)aputta). **These**
passages, along with what we know from the old texts of the Jainas and from **other** sources, convey a clear image of these ascetics' motivations and practices. The main aim pursued by them was release from the cycle of rebirths. Since they **held** that rebirth is determined by the actions carried out in a previous life, they **believed** that liberation could be reached by suppressing all activities. The following **passage** describes the Buddha's meeting with such **ascetics:**
Now, Mahānāma, on one occasion I was living at Rājagṛha on the **mountain** Vulture Peak. On that occasion a number of Nigaṇṭhas living on the **Black** Rock on the slopes of Isigili were practising continuous standing, **rejecting** seats, and were experiencing painful, racking, piercing sensations due to exertion.

Then, when it was evening, I rose from meditation and went to the Nigaṇṭhas there. I asked them: "Friends, why do you practise **continuous** standing, rejecting seats, and experience painful, racking, **piercing** sensations due to **exertion?"**
When this was said, they replied: "Friend, the Nigaṇṭha Nā**taputta** is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus: "Whether I am walking or standing or asleep or **awake,** knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to **me."** He says thus: "Nigaṇṭhas, you have done evil actions in the past; **exhaust** them with the performance of piercing austerities. And when you are **here** and now restrained in body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil **actions** for the future. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by **doing** no new actions, there will be no consequence in the future. **With** no consequence in the future, there is the destruction of action. With the destruction of action, there is the destruction of suffering. With the destruction of suffering, there is the destruction of sensation. With the destruction of sensation, all suffering will be exhausted." This is **[the** doctrine] we approve of and accept, and we are satisfied with it." **[...]**

Friend Gotama, pleasure is not to be gained through **pleasure;**
pleasure is to be gained through pain. For were pleasure to be **gained** through pleasure, then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha would **gain**
pleasure, since he abides in greater pleasure than the venerable **Gotama."**89 During another meeting with Jainas, the Buddha expresses himself in the **following**
ironic way:90 "If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was **done**
in the past, then the Nigaṇṭhas surely must have carried out bad actions in the **past,** since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing **sensations."**
In these passages, the Jainas' practices are explicitly criticised. **Elsewhere,**
in a passage which presumably describes the Buddha's efforts before his enlightenment, when he was still a Bodhisattva, they are criticised **implictly.**91 We are told that the Boddhisattva, since his discipleship with two teachers had **proved** vain, decided to practise asceticism alone. He found an appropriate place, and started to practise the 'meditation without breathing' (Pa appā*naka jh*āna; **Skt.** aprāṇ*aka dhy*āna). This meditation is described in all its horrifying particulars, and it leads to a situation where some gods believe that the Bodhisattva is dead. **After** this meditation without breathing, the Bodhisattva decides to fast, and in **fasting** too, he goes to extremes. (Characteristically, the Bodhisattva does not die of starvation, as some Jainas did, because the gods prevent this.) After all these **trials,**
he reaches the following conclusion:92 "Whatever recluses and Brahmins in the **past**
have experienced painful, racking, piercing sensations due to exertion, this is the utmost, there is none beyond this. And whatever recluses and Brahmins in the future will experience painful, racking, piercing sensations due to exertion, **this** is the utmost, there is none beyond this. And whatever recluses and **Brahmins** at present experience painful, racking, piercing sensations due to exertion, this is the utmost, there is none beyond this. But by this racking practice of austerities I **have** not attained any super-human states, any distinction in knowledge and **vision** worthy of the noble ones. Could there be another path to **enlightenment?"**
The aim of this supposedly autobiographical description is clear: it **shows**
that the Buddha knows from his own experience the ascetic path **presumably** leading to liberation, and that he has followed this path as far as, or even **further** than, the rival ascetics themselves. He therefore also knows from **personal** experience that this path is of no use and does not lead to the desired **goal.** It is of particular interest to note that this path, which was purportedly tried by the Buddha, is in all details identical to that of the Jainas. This is further **emphasized** by the fact that this autobiographical episode is once narrated during a **conversation** with a Jaina. This conclusion is furthermore justified by its contents, for it is the Jainas who sought liberation by means of fasting and suppressing breath. There are other details that support this **position.**93 It is clear from what precedes that the Buddha made a distinction **between**
his teaching and the ascetic mode of life primarily followed by the **Jainas.** Surprisingly, elsewhere in the discourses this rejected mode of life is **propounded**
by the Buddha himself, sometimes in exactly the same words.94 In a passage **from**
the Aṅ*guttara Nik*āya, for example, the Buddha instructs the Jaina **Vappa** as follows:95 "As these taints (āsrava, Pa ā*sava*) which come about as a **result** of bodily activities […], as a result of activities of speech, […] as a result of **activities** of mind, in the case of one who abstains from bodily activities[…], from **activities** of speech and mind that cause vexation and distress, it follows that those **taints** causing pain do not exist in him. He carries out no fresh action; as to his **former** action, he wears it out by constant contact with it." From this, we must **conclude** that such ascetic practices, although criticised by the Buddha, were **nevertheless**
adopted by certain **Buddhists.**96 The aim of the ascetic practices described above was to subdue one's **actions,** words and thoughts. The efforts to suppress the sense organs are related to **these.** These practices, too, are mentioned in the Buddhist discourses, once **again** critically. Thus we hear about a teacher who taught a practice of cultivation of the sense organs which had the result that the practitioner would not see any **forms** with the eye, nor hear any sounds with the ear. When the Buddha was **informed** about this, he commented that if this was cultivating the sense organs, then the blind and the deaf were cultivating their sense organs.97 We have already **noticed**
the same kind of irony in the story of the standing Jainas. It is therefore all the more remarkable to observe that the Buddha himself is supposed to **have**
undertaken such practices. The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, which describes the end of the Buddha's life,98 relates the following discussion between the Buddha and a certain Putkasa (Pa Pukkusa). The latter is a disciple of the **teacher** Ārāḍa Kālāma (Pa Āḻāra Kālāma), and tells the following story about **him:**
Once, Lord, Āḻāra Kālāma was going along the main road and, **turning** aside, he went and sat down under a nearby tree [...]. And five hundred **carts** went rumbling by very close to him. A man who was walking along **behind**
them came to Āḻāra Kālāma and said: "Lord, did you not see five **hundred**
carts go by?" "No, friend, I did not." "But didn't you hear them, **Lord?"** "No, friend, I did not." "Well, were you asleep, Lord?" "No, friend, I was not asleep." "Then, Lord, were you conscious?" "Yes, friend." "So, **Lord,** being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five hundred **carts** passing close by you, even though your outer robe was bespattered **with** dust?" "That is so, **friend."** And that man thought: "It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These **wanderers**
are so calm that though conscious and awake, a man neither saw nor **heard** five hundred carts passing close by him!" And he went away praising **Āḻā**ra Kālāma's lofty **powers.**99
 

96 The same opinion is voiced by Ruegg, 1989: **142-43.**
97 MN III.298 f.; cf. SĀ p. 78a l. 22 f.

98 The terms *nirv*āṇa and *parinirv*āṇa initially meant the same thing. Only later the **term**
parinirvāṇa came to designate the Buddha's death. Cf. Bronkhorst, 1993: 97-98, **with**
references to further literature; Kubo, **1992:** 3.

99 DN II. 130-132; tr. Walshe, 1995: 258-259; Bareau, 1970: 282 ff.; Waldschmidt, **1950-**
1951: 270 ff.

We easily recognise here the "cultivation of the sense organs bringing it about **that** one cannot see any forms with the eye, nor hear any sounds with the ear", and we would expect the Buddha to reject it here too. But this does not happen, for he answers:
"Well, Pukkusa, what do you think? What do you consider is more **difficult**
to do or attain to - while conscious and awake not to see or hear **five** hundred carts passing nearby or, while conscious and awake, not to see or hear anything when the rain-god streams and splashes, when **lightning**
flashes and thunder **crashes?"**
"Lord, how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred **carts**
with that - or even six, seven, eight, nine or ten hundred, or **hundreds** of thousands of carts to that? To see or hear nothing when such a storm **rages** is more **difficult…"**
"Once, Pukkusa, when I was staying at Ātuma, at the **threshing-floor,**
the rain-god streamed and splashed, lightning flashed and thunder **crashed,** and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen were killed. And a lot of **people** went out of Ātuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were **killed.**
And, Pukkusa, I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshing-floor and was walking up and down outside. And a man from the crowd came to me, saluted me and stood to one side. And I said to **him:**
'Friend, why are all these people gathered here?' 'Lord, there has been a great storm and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen have **been** killed. But you, Lord, where have you been?' 'I have been right **here,** friend.' 'But what did you see, Lord?' 'I saw nothing, friend.' 'Or what did you hear, Lord?' 'I heard nothing, friend.' 'Then, Lord, were you conscious?' 'Yes, friend.' 'So, Lord, being conscious and awake you **neither** saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and **lightning?'** 'That is so, **friend.'**
And, Pukkusa, that man thought: 'It is wonderful, it is **marvellous!**
These wanderers are so calm that they neither see nor hear when the raingod streams and splashes, lightning flashes and thunder **crashes!'**
Proclaiming my lofty powers, he saluted me, passed by to the right and departed."
Again we notice that practices which were explicitly rejected by the **Buddha**
nevertheless found a way into Buddhism.100 In this last case, it is also clear **that**
rivalry between religious groups played a role, as it was obviously impossible for the Buddhists to admit that non-Buddhist teachers had skills which the Buddha did not **possess.** 
This last passage mentions the teacher Ārāḍa Kālāma, whose name is **also**
known from another part of the Buddha legend. For Ārāḍa Kālāma was one of his two teachers at the time when he was still a Bodhisattva and had not **reached** enlightenment yet. We have seen how a so-called autobiographical episode of the Buddha was used to prove the uselessness of the Jainas' self-torturing **practices.** We are therefore entitled to suppose that the description of the Buddha's **study** under Ārāḍa Kālāma and Udraka, the son of Rāma, may likewise contain **elements** of propaganda. And this is indeed the case. What the Bodhisattva learns **from** Ārāḍa Kālāma and subsequently from Udraka, the son of Rāma, is the **following:**
from Ārāḍa Kālāma he learns the Realm of Nothingness (ākiñcanyā*yatana*), and from Udraka, the son of Rāma, he learns the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Nonideation (naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā*yatana*). His studies are so successful **that** Ārāḍa Kālāma suggests that they should, both of them, instruct his students **together;** Udraka, the son of Rāma, even offers him the sole leadership of his school. But in both cases the Bodhisattva refuses, and he justifies this with the remark that **these** doctrines do not lead to renunciation, to lack of passion, to cessation, to **peace,** to knowledge, to enlightenment, and to Nirvāṇa, but only to the **Realm** of Nothingness, or, respectively, to the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation.101 On the basis of the mere names of these realms, it is impossible to get an exact idea of their particular nature and of the differences between them. But the names suggest that they are states in which thoughts and other mental activities are suppressed. This is confirmed by the circumstance that the same **name** Ārāḍa Kālāma is also mentioned in connection with the suppression of the sense **organs** described above. Furthermore, it is important to note that the **same** autobiographical passages which describe how the Bodhisattva rejects the **Realm** of Nothingness and the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation **continue** to narrate how he (re)discovers the first stage of meditation and **immediately** understands that this is the path to enlightenment. These two realms are **thus** contrasted with the stages of meditation; only the latter lead to **Nirv**āṇa. 

In spite of this, the realms taught by Ārāḍa Kālāma and by Udraka, the son of Rāma, managed to find a way into the Buddhist tradition. Consider the **account** of the Buddha's **death:**
These were the Buddha's last **words.**
Then the Lord entered the first stage of meditation (dhyāna, Pa jhāna). And leaving that he entered the second, the third, the fourth **stage** of meditation. Then leaving the fourth stage of meditation, he entered the Realm of Infinity of **Space** (ākāśānantyā*yatana*), then the Realm of **Infinity**
of Consciousness (vijñānānantyā*yatana*), then the Realm of **Nothingness**
(ākiñcanyā*yatana*), then the Realm of Neither Ideation nor **Non-ideation**
(naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā*yatana*), and leaving that he attained the **Cessation** of Ideation and Feeling (saṃjñā*vedayitanirodha*).

Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable **Anuruddha:**
"Venerable Anuruddha, the Lord has passed away." "No, friend Ānanda, the Lord has not passed away, he has attained the Cessation of Feeling and Ideation."
Then the Lord, leaving the attainment of the Cessation of Feeling and Ideation, entered the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation, from **that** he entered the Realm of Nothingness, the Realm of **Infinity** of Consciousness, the Realm of Infinity of Space. From the Realm of **Infinity** of Space he entered the fourth stage of meditation, from there the third, the second and the first stage of meditation. Leaving the first **stage** of meditation, he entered the second, the third, the fourth stage of **meditation.**
And, leaving the fourth stage of meditation, the Lord finally passed away.102 These same mental states are also mentioned once (and once only) in **connection**
with the Buddha's enlightenment. According to a passage from the Aṅ*guttara* Nikāya, the Bodhisattva gradually entered into the nine stages mentioned **above,** up to the highest of them, namely, the Cessation of Ideation and **Feeling**
(saṃjñā*vedayitanirodha*). Here his taints were destroyed, having been seen **with**
wisdom. The Buddha concludes this autobiographical passage with the words:103
"And so long, Ānanda, as I attained not to, emerged not from these **nine**
attainments of gradual abidings (samā*patti*), both forwards and **backwards,** I
realized not completely, as one wholly awakened, the full perfect **awakening,** unsurpassed in the world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, on earth with its recluses, godly men, devas and men; but when I attained to and emerged from **these** abidings suchwise, then, wholly awakened, I realized completely the full **perfect** awakening unsurpassed. … Then knowledge and vision rose up within me: **Mind's** release for me is unshakable, this birth is final, there is now no becoming **again."** 
Since no mental processes take place in the Cessation of Ideation and Feeling, the highest enlightenment cannot take place in that realm. The **Buddha** only realised that he had gained enlightenment after he emerged again from **these** realms. It is apparently also impossible to pass from the Cessation of Ideation and Feeling into the Nirvāṇa which takes place at death. These considerations **support** the claim, made above, that the aim of these realms - i.e., from the **Realm** of Infinity of Space up to the Cessation of Ideation and Feeling - was to **suppress** thoughts and other mental activities. Such realms, or the efforts made to **reach** them, correspond quite accurately to the general idea of liberation of the Jainas and other ascetics pursuing similar goals: for them, the main means to reach **liberation** is to put an end to all activities, even mental ones. Such realms of consciousness (if we may call them that) were rejected by the Buddha, but nevertheless soon **found** a place among the states which the Buddhists sought to attain in their **mental** practice. 

In the above passages the Cessation of Ideation and **Feeling**
(saṃjñā*vedayitanirodha*) is the highest stage. Sometimes only the four **stages**
which precede it are mentioned together, namely, from the Realm of **Infinity** of Space (ākāśānantyā*yatana*) to the Realm of Neither Ideation nor **Non-ideation** (naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā*yatana*). These are the Four Formless States (ārūpya, Pa arūpa), among which the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation is the highest. The Realm of Nothingness (ākiñcanyā*yatana*) is the highest stage in the so-called seven Stations of Consciousness (vijñānasthiti, Pa viññāṇaṭṭ*hiti*). **None** of these series can be taken to be authentic.104 What distinguishes the four original stages of meditation from the nonauthentic realms? If the suppression of all mental activities characterises the **latter,** we must assume that the same does not hold - or at least not to the same **extent** - for the former. In any case this kind of suppression should not be the main **goal** of the Four Stages of Meditation. Their goal lies in another dimension, which we may call "the mystical dimension" for want of a better word. From this point of **view,** the Four Stages of Meditation seek to attain an ever deeper "mystical" **state,** whereas the four realms of attainment only aim at suppressing mental **activities.** It is of course not ruled out that normal mental activities may become weaker in the deeper "mystical" states. This is indeed what the description of the Four **Stages** of Meditation suggests. Thought and reflection disappear in the second **stage** of meditation. Satisfaction disappears in the third, well-being, ill-being, pleasure and displeasure disappear in the fourth. Equanimity and mindfulness, on the **contrary,** and apparently consciousness too, remain until the fourth stage. Conversely, **there** is no reason to suppose that the non-authentic realms of attainment have **anything** to do with the "mystical" dimension. This is not only suggested by the circumstance that concomitant phenomena, which appear in the **stages** of meditation under the names of "satisfaction", "well-being", etc., are not **mentioned** here. It is more important that the "mystical" dimension has no role to **play** in practices whose main goal is to put an end to all mental and physical activities.105 A few things remain to be said about the non-authentic realms of **attainment.**
We have seen that these originally belong to a set of ideas and practices in **which** the suppression of all activities is thought to bring about liberation in two **different,** mutually supporting ways: "by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no new actions", as the Jainas explained to the Buddha. Here **liberation** presupposes that all previous actions are destroyed and that no new actions **take** Buddhist texts, too, these realms of attainment were often associated with the **idea** of liberation at the time of death. Cessation of Ideation and **Feeling**
(saṃjñā*vedayitanirodha*), also called Attainment of Cessation (nirodhasamā*patti*),
is therefore sometimes described as similar to Nirvāṇa or as touching it.106

## Recapitulation

The method explained at the beginning of this chapter has allowed us to **distinguish** between doctrines which we can confidently ascribe to the historical Buddha, and others that we have good reasons to suppose were not part of his original **teaching.** It leads to the remarkable conclusion that a sizable part of what came to be **ascribed** to the Buddha had not been taught by the founder himself. It is **worthwhile** to recapitulate briefly the teachings in the ancient Canon which, by applying **this**
method, turn out not derive from the **Buddha.**
These teachings are of two kinds. Some deal with the theme of **liberating**
knowledge. There are several of these, because there was no consensus in the Buddhist tradition as to the exact content of liberating knowledge. We have **seen** that the idea of an explicitly formulated liberating knowledge cannot be **considered** as original to Buddhism; it rather came about under the influence of **non-Buddhist** currents. Conversely, the contents of the liberating knowledge were not **borrowed** from non-Buddhist currents. We have no reason to doubt that the historical **Buddha** taught the Four Noble Truths, for example. The same holds for the doctrine **that**
there is no self in the Five Aggregates (*skandha*), although in this case, as we **have**
seen, the assignment of this doctrine to the role of liberating knowledge **appears** to be indebted to non-Buddhist ideas. There are many reasons to suppose that the doctrine of Conditioned Origination (pratī*tyasamutp*āda) was not taught by the Buddha in the form in which it is preserved in the Canon. This does not alter the fact that this formulation is entirely Buddhist because, as far as we can tell, it has not been borrowed from other sources. The fact that this formulation - like the Four Noble Truths and the doctrine of Non-Self - could become the content of the liberating knowledge, however, can be explained by the fact that the **early** Buddhists were looking for a content of their liberating knowledge, **being** influenced in this respect by certain non-Buddhist religious currents of their **time.** Furthermore, the doctrine of Non-Self could easily be reinterpreted so as to **become** similar to the non-Buddhist doctrines of the self, as we have **seen.** 
Beside the teachings about liberating knowledge, there are others **which**
reveal a close relationship with the ascetic movements of those days. The **main** theme of these movements was to suppress all bodily and mental processes and bring them to a stand-still. In the Buddhist texts, these ideas find **expression** in certain mental exercises that aim at suppressing mental activities and **emotional** states. They also find expression in forms of physical asceticism that found a **place** in the Buddhist **tradition.** 
Louis de La Vallée Poussin pointed out as long ago as in 1937 that these two currents within the Buddhist texts - he calls them opposite theories - are the **same**
as those which are respectively called Sāṃkhya and Yoga in the *Bhagavadg*ītā: in the first, liberation is entirely or primarily obtained by means of knowledge, **i.e.,** intellectual effort; in the second, this goal is reached by means of **ascetic**
practice.107 This parallelism is not coincidental. As we have seen, the two **currents**
within Buddhism developed under the influence of two currents that existed **outside** it. This does not mean that there is no difference between Buddhism and the **other** religious movements that existed at that time. On the contrary, **Buddhism** succeeded in integrating these outside influences in such a manner that its own specificity was not at risk. This does not alter the fact that the Buddhism **that** we know from the old texts already contains many elements which do not come **from** its founder. The two currents discussed above, the intellectual one and the **ascetic** one, were not taught by the Buddha. This does not signify that the **Buddha's** message is no longer available in the ancient texts, and that this **pre-canonical** doctrine can only be uncovered by means of deductions and speculative **theories.** As we have tried to show, the Buddha's original teaching has been **transmitted** by the Buddhist texts just as efficiently as the non-original material. It **included** criticism of other intellectual and ascetic movements that existed at its **time,** elements of which nevertheless managed to find their way into the **Buddhist** tradition. 

It is not easy to get a clear picture of the Buddha's original **teaching.**
Certainly, its aim was to stop suffering and rebirth. To achieve this, the **Buddha** taught a path in which consciousness played a major role. This is clear from the awareness practices and from the Four Stages of Meditation. In the highest **stage** of meditation it is somehow possible, with the help of wisdom (*prajñ*ā), to bring **about**
a decisive transformation. Once this has happened, the goal is **attained.**
The most astonishing thing about the teaching of the Buddha is **that** it is in some respects radically different from other teachings that were current in its **time** and region. The Buddhist texts themselves insist that the Buddha had **discovered** something new, and that he therefore taught something new. Scholars have **often** claimed that Buddhism is a special type of Yoga, assuming that a form of **Yoga**
similar to Buddhism existed already at the time of the Buddha. This is incorrect.108 It is true that classical Yoga has several points in common with Buddhism, but **this** is due to the influence of Buddhism on Yoga, as we shall see below. There are no indications that classical Yoga, or something like it, existed at the time of the Buddha. The aim of pre-classical Yoga, like that of the practice of the Jainas, was to suppress bodily and mental activities;109 it has little in common with the **practice**
taught by the Buddha, and it appears that the Buddha regularly tried to make **this** clear - to no **avail.**
The Buddha preached a quite new method, whose aim was to put an end to suffering and rebirth. This new method had to find its place alongside the established methods, of which there were several. Among them we can **distinguish** two in particular. Both share one common premise, namely, that rebirth is **caused** and conditioned by actions, and that as a result one must somehow get rid of **one's** actions. This happens either by suppressing all mental and bodily activities - **this** is the first method - or by realising that the true self does not participate in any activities - this is the second method. These two methods propose a solution **which** fits the problem in an obvious manner. In contrast, it was not at all obvious how and why the method taught by the Buddha could put an end to **rebirth.** In comparison with its two rivals, the Buddhist method seemed ill-suited to the **task.** 
This circumstance is responsible for the fact that, from the start, **Buddhist**
tradition incorporated, in adjusted form, practices and ideas which belonged to the other two methods. The same circumstance also explains why the Buddhist **textual** corpus contains side by side a variety of different methods. The Buddhists had a problem, and they tried to solve it in this **way.** 
These attemps to solve the problem were only half-hearted, and they **could**
not be otherwise. For the Buddhist tradition also preserved clear statements of the Buddha which rejected the alternative methods. Buddhism was therefore faced **with** a problem which it could not solve. The doctrine of Non-Self, in particular, **which** was too solidly grounded in the tradition to be simply pushed aside, **remained** a major challenge. The inescapable conflict that resulted lent an internal **dynamic** to the further development of Buddhism - a topic which we shall examine **more** closely below. 

# 3. Arranging The **Doctrine**

The origin of the dharma theory Shortly before his death the Buddha is recorded to have taught his disciple Ā**nanda**
in the following manner:110 "It may come to pass, Ānanda, that you will think: **'The**
doctrine is deprived of its teacher, we no longer have a master.' You should not think thus, Ānanda. The doctrine (*dharma*) and the discipline (*vinaya*) that I **taught**
you, they shall be your teachers after my demise." The Buddha's disciples **knew**
how to value these words. We owe it to their efforts that the **collections** of discourses and disciplinary rules ascribed to him were preserved. However, **they** were not content with merely memorising these discourses and rules (which **were**
not consigned to writing until several centuries after his death).111 They also **studied**
the contents of the Master's teaching, arranging its main points into **lists** of concepts. Thus we have the Four Noble Truths, the Four Stages of **Meditation**
(dhyāna), the Five Aggregates (*skandha*), the Twelve Realms of the **Senses**
(ā*yatana*), the Eighteen Elements (dhātu), and so **forth.** 
The search for such lists of concepts began early. A discourse relates the following in this regard: When the Buddha was still alive, Vardhamāna, the founder of Jainism, died. Soon quarrels arose among Vardhamāna's **disciples** as to the correct interpretation of his teaching. In order to prevent similar **happenings** in the Buddhist community, Śāriputra, a senior disciple, composed a long list of all of the Buddha's important doctrines, and explained them to the other disciples.112 It is not surprising that the search for lists of concepts should already **appear**
in the oldest Buddhist texts. For example, an important book belonging to the Basket of Discourses (Sūtra-piṭaka, Pa Sutta-piṭaka) is called Aṅ*guttara Nik*āya in Pāli, and Ekottarā*gama* in Sanskrit. Following Winternitz, these two terms are probably best translated as "the collection of discourses classified in **increasing**
numerical order".113 In the Pāli version, the discourses - numbering at least **2308** –
are arranged in eleven chapters (nipāta) in such a way that the first chapter **deals**
with things that are unique, the second with things of which there are two, the **third** with things of which there are three, etc., up to the eleventh chapter, which **deals** with things of which there are eleven. For instance, in the chapter on **twofold** things, we find discourses on the two things that one must avoid, on the two **dark** and two light things, on the two reasons for living in the forest, on the two **kinds** of Buddhas, etc.; in the part dealing with threefold things, we find discourses on the triad of actions, words and thoughts, on the three kinds of monks, and so forth.114 The Chinese version of the Ekottarā*gama* is classified according to the **same**
general principles, but differs so drastically from the Pāli version in details **that** we are forced to conclude that the two collections were produced **independently** of each other.115 The same need to preserve the Buddha's teaching and to fit it as **neatly** as possible in lists of concepts is shown in two Sūtras belonging to the **"Collection** of long discourses" (Dīrghāgama, Pa Dī*gha Nik*āya), the Saṅgīti Sūtra and the Daśottara Sūtra.

116 These two Sūtras likewise present doctrinal concepts **arranged**
Lists of concepts are also the basis for the texts found in the Abhidharmapiṭaka, the "Basket of Scholasticism".117 Only the Abhidharma-piṭaka of the Theravādins and the Abhidharma-piṭaka of the Sarvāstivādins have been **fully**
preserved. They are highly dissimilar.118 Nevertheless, it is important to note **that**
both Piṭakas contain texts which have a close connection with the old **discourses.**
This is true of the Saṅgī*tipary*āya, a commentary in the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharmapiṭaka on the above-mentioned Saṅgīti Sūtra, and even more of the Dharmaskandha of the Sarvāstivādins and the *Vibha*ṅga of the Theravādins, **which**
are very closely connected and are probably both derived from the same **original**
text, now lost.119 Both texts have in common that they first introduce a short Sūtra text, and that this text and the doctrines it contains are subsequently **explained** in detail. This shows how the authors of these treatises proceeded. The words of the Buddha transmitted by tradition provided their basis. Nothing new was **added,** except that the doctrines were arranged into lists. The Buddhists of that period **were** concerned not to add anything new to the teachings of the Buddha. It is **therefore** all the more surprising to see how these activities were responsible for the **arising** of fundamentally different teachings in the course of time. As far as we can **tell,** this happened independently of anyone's conscious will. In the following **pages** we shall concentrate on the factors which brought about these changes, **leaving** everything else **aside.**
The attempts to arrange the Buddha's teaching and to consign its **main**
points to lists have parallels in the Indian context. The canonical texts of **Jainism** in particular show the same tendency. In the third main section (aṅga) of the **Jaina**
canon, the Èhāṇaṃga, various topics are treated in numerical sequence, from one to ten, as in the Buddhist Aṅ*guttara Nik*āya. The fourth Aṅga, the *Samav*āyaṃga, continues in the same way: the contents of the first two thirds of this work are **also**
arranged in categories, like the Èhāṇaṃga, but here the numbers go beyond **ten,**
they even go beyond a hundred, reaching immense heights.120 What makes the Buddhist lists of concepts important for the development of the doctrine, **however,** is the circumstance that this tendency to enumerate itself gave rise to a new doctrine, the so-called *dharma theory*. This happened at the end of a **development**
which we shall trace **below.**
To illustrate the new mode of thought, let us first examine a **presentation** of the path leading to liberation which is repeatedly found in the old **discourses,** as well as in more recent Buddhist texts. This presentation is composed of **seven** building-blocks. Each of them is an independent list of concepts, and all of **these** lists of concepts also occur independently in the texts. The new presentation of the path to liberation is in this way a collection of previously existing **elements.** Together, they contain what was seen by the Buddhists of those days as the **essence** of the Buddha's **teaching.** The lists of concepts collected in this way **are:** 
1. the Four Applications of Mindfulness (smṛtyupasthāna, Pa *satipa*ṭṭhāna)
2. the Four Right Exertions (samyakpradhāna / -prahāṇa, Pa *sammappadh*āna)
121 3. the Four Constituent Parts of Supernatural Power (ṛddhipāda, Pa *iddhip*āda)
4. the Five Faculties (*indriya*)
5. the Five Strengths (*bala*)
6. the Seven Helpful Means to Enlightenment (bodhyaṅga, Pa *bojjha*ṅga)
7. the Noble Eightfold Path (ā**rya a**ṣṭāṅga mārga, Pa ariya aṭṭhaṅ*gika magga*).

These four enumerations contain a total of thirty-seven concepts, which **later** became known under the common designation of Dharmas **Helpful** to Enlightenment (bodhipakṣyā˙ / bodhipākṣikā˙ dharmā˙, Pa **bodhipakkhiy**ā dhammā).122 A closer examination of these lists shows that their collection did not produce an organic whole. They can be described as follows:123 The Four Applications of Mindfulness (smṛ*tyupasth*āna) are: 1. The application of mindfulness to the body, 2. the application of mindfulness to the sensations (*vedan*ā), 3. the application of mindfulness to the mind (*citta*), and 4. the application of mindfulness to the dharmas. A comparison of the various **versions** of the canonical texts reveals that the dharmas meant under point 4 were **perhaps**
initially only the "Seven Helpful Means to Enlightenment" (*bodhya*ṅga), to be mentioned below.124 But perhaps we should also add the Five **Hindrances**
(nī*vara*ṇa) - i.e. the desire for pleasures of the senses, malice, sloth, irritation and doubt - and the six fetters (saṃ*yojana*), which arise from the internal and **external**
realms of perception - i.e. the organs of the senses and the objects of the **senses** –
or from their contact.125 The Four Right Exertions (samyakpradhāna /-*prah*āṇa) are the **exertions** to preserve oneself from bad, unwholesome dharmas which are yet to **arise,** to abandon bad, unwholesome dharmas which have already arisen, to bring **forth** wholesome dharmas which are yet to arise, and to protect wholesome **dharmas** which have already **arisen.** 
The Four Constituent Parts of Supernatural Power (ṛ*ddhip*āda) are accompanied (1) by concentration originating from desire and conditioned **factors** originating from exertion, (2) by concentration originating from energy and conditioned factors originating from exertion, (3) by concentration **originating** from mind and conditioned factors originating from exertion, (4) by **concentration** originating from examination and conditioned factors originating from **exertion.**
The Five Faculties (*indriya*) are: faith (ś*raddh*ā), energy (vīrya),
mindfulness (smṛti), concentration (samādhi), wisdom (*prajñ*ā).

The Five Strengths (*bala*) are: faith (ś*raddh*ā), energy (vīrya), **mindfulness**
(smṛti), concentration (samādhi), wisdom (*prajñ*ā). 

The Seven Helpful Means to Enlightenment (*bodhya*ṅga) are: **mindfulness**
(smṛti), understanding the doctrine (*dharmapravicaya*), energy (vīrya), **pleasure**
(prīti), calm (praś*rabdhi*), concentration (samādhi), equanimity (*upek*ṣā).

We have already discussed the Noble Eightfold Path (ā**rya a**ṣṭāṅga mārga):
right views, right resolution, right word, right action, right living, right **exertion,**
right mindfulness (smṛti), right concentration (samādhi).

These lists of concepts overlap repeatedly. The list of strengths, for **instance,**
is not different from the list of faculties. The difference between these two was obviously not clear to the oldest Buddhist tradition either, and attempts were **made**
to solve the problem.126 There are other overlaps: concentration (samādhi), for instance, is mentioned in four places, mindfulness (smṛti) appears in four **lists**
besides the one which is dedicated to it, etc. All this is best explained by the assumption that the Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment were not **conceived** of together; rather, they were assembled more or less haphazardly by joining preexisting lists. This composite list shows how important it was for the **Buddhists** in those days to arrange the essential parts of the Buddhist doctrine in **lists.** 
In spite of its obvious weaknesses, this list of thirty-seven Dharmas **Helpful**
to Enlightenment became very important. They are stated to be wholesome (kuśala, Pa *kusala*). They must be cultivated in order to be freed of taints (ā*srava*, Pa ā*sava*). They are said to constitute the "cultivation of the road". They are the **jewels**
of the doctrine.127 For the Buddhists of those days, taken together they represent the essence of Buddhist doctrine and practice.128 We shall return later to their **role** in subsequent **developments.**
This list was also important for the arrangement of the doctrine. It **became**
the basis for additions and extraneous enlargements. We find it in a more or **less** enlarged form in the so-called Mātṛkās of the Abhidharma texts of **various** Buddhist schools. It has also partly determined the internal arrangement of the Saṃyutta Nikāya / Saṃyuktā*gama*.

129 Let us now examine the important word *dharma* (Pa *dhamma*) and its meanings. We have already met this word several times, in very different **senses.**
First of all, *dharma* means "doctrine". The Buddha told his disciples that the doctrine (*dharma*) and the discipline (*vinaya*) would be their teachers after his demise. The word *dharma* is however also used in another sense, which is not **easy**
to define, because the word taken in this second sense underwent a **semantic** change in the course of **time.** 
We can start with the observation that in many passages (perhaps the **oldest)**
the word *dharma* means something akin to 'mental property, characteristic of the mind'. Consider how the word is used in the long depiction of the path **leading** to liberation, discussed in the section on "Main teachings", above. Two **extracts** should be **considered:** 
On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and **features.** Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome **states** of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear [...] On smelling an odour with the nose [...] On tasting a flavour with the tongue [...] On touching a **tangible**
with the body [...] On cognizing a mental property (*dharma*) with the **mind,**
he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind **faculty** unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might **invade** him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the mind **faculty,** he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this noble **restraint** of the faculties, he experiences within himself a bliss that is **unsullied.**

## Furthermore:

Abandoning covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind free **from** covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill **will** and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compasionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and **hatred.** Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and **torpor,** percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from **sloth** and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated **with** a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond **doubt,**
unperplexed about wholesome mental properties (*dharma*); he purifies his mind from **doubt.** Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind **that** weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded **from**
unwholesome mental properties (*dharma*), he enters upon and abides in the first stage of meditation, which is accompanied by deliberation and reflection, with pleasure and joy born of seclusion.

Clearly, the English translation "mental property", in the sense of **"characteristic** of the mind", is appropriate here for *dharma*.

The dharmas are also mentioned in connection with the **applications** of mindfulness (smṛ*tyupasth*āna), of which the fourth is the **"application** of mindfulness to the dharmas". These dharmas were perhaps initially only the **Seven**
Helpful Means to Enlightenment (*bodhya*ṅga): mindfulness (smṛti), **understanding** the doctrine (*dharmapravicaya*), energy (vīrya), pleasure (prīti), calm (praś*rabdhi*), concentration (samādhi), equanimity (*upek*ṣā). Probably the Five **Hindrances**
(nī*vara*ṇa) - i.e. desire for pleasure of the senses, malice, sloth, irritation and **doubt**
- and the six fetters (saṃ*yojana*) were also included. Again, the translation **'mental**
property' **fits.**
The dharmas are again mentioned in the description of the four **exertions.**
These are the exertions to preserve oneself from bad, unwholesome dharmas **which** are yet to arise, to abandon bad, unwholesome dharmas which have already **arisen,** to bring forth wholesome dharmas which are yet to arise, and to protect **wholesome** dharmas which have already **arisen.**
It is clear from all these passages that the term *dharma* here **applies** to properties of the mind. The dharmas are the objects of the mind (*manas*), **just** as form is the object of the eye, or sound the object of the ear. These dharmas can be wholesome or unwholesome. A few unwholesome dharmas are **mentioned** by name: desire, displeasure, perhaps also malice, anger, rigidity, sloth, **irritation,** regret and **doubt.** 
The semantic development of this term can be understood as **follows.** We have seen that the early Buddhists took pains to arrange the elements of the doctrine. This was by producing numerical sequences and lists. Besides, there **were** principles of classification, some of which had already begun to be used in the old texts. These are the Five Aggregates (*skandha*), the Twelve Realms of the **Senses** (ā*yatana*), and the Eighteen Elements (dhātu). However, these principles do not merely arrange properties of mind. Indeed, in the case of the Five Aggregates, the first aggregate - that of form (rūpa) - contains the physical, i.e., non **mental,**
aspects of the personality. The case is even more extreme for the realms of the senses (ā*yatana*). The realms of the senses are the sense organs and their objects.

Ten out of the Twelve Realms of the Senses have little to do with the mind and are not properties of mind. A similar observation can be made for the **elements** (dhātu),
which partly overlap with the realms of the senses. It is extremely unlikely that the aggregates, the realms of the senses and the elements were originally **meant** as classifications of the dharmas. They nevertheless came to be seen as such. In the old discourses, the word *dharma* is very seldom used in connection with **these** classifications. And the few passages in the Pāli Sutta-piṭaka which use the **term** dharma in connection with the Five Aggregates are found almost without **exception**
in the Saṃ*yutta Nik*āya, whose arrangement, as we have seen, was **determined** by Abhidharma-like lists of concepts and which is, therefore, relatively close to **later**
developments.130 The collections of dharmas which were produced in this way had in the end not all that much to do with properties of mind. But the name dharma was **kept,** notwithstanding the heterogeneous nature of the elements contained in **these** collections.

One further development came to play a significant role in the **subsequent**
interpretations of the dharma theory. It concerns the concept of the person and the interpretation of passages about the non-self. We have already seen that the **various**
components of the person - especially the Five Aggregates (*skandha*) - are not the self. A few frequently repeated passages in the Pāli canon also claim that all the dharmas are not the self (sabbe dhammā *anatt*ā).131 This was **increasingly**
interpreted in the sense that the parts constituting a person do not together **form** a new entity, which would be the person. The person therefore does not exist: **only**
its component parts exist. Instead of a self (ātman, Pa *atta(n)*), the texts now **also**
speak of a person (pudgala, Pa *puggala*).132 This person is **represented** as a composite entity, which, for that very reason, does not exist. The negation of the one would not find any persons in that list, because they do not really **exist.** We should note that the person, whose existence is here denied, is no longer the **self** as it is represented in certain Upanishads and elsewhere outside Buddhism. We are dealing with a completely different concept of the self or person, namely, a **self**
which is a collection of dharmas and which does not exist *because* it is a collection.133 This way of thinking has consequences. We have seen how the **enlarged**
meaning of the word *dharma* led to the position that the dharmas were no **longer**
only properties of mind: they now also included things that were not found in the human mind. From this one had to conclude that not only the human mind, but absolutely everything that exists in the world is composed of dharmas. Now, if the person is characterised as not really existing because it is a collection of **dharmas,** then the same also holds for all other collections of dharmas, i.e., for **practically**
everything that exists, with the exception of the dharmas themselves.134 This **means**
that all the objects that we know from everyday life do not really exist. **Drawing** attention to this became one of the favourite themes of Buddhist texts, as we **shall** show with a few **examples.**
Already in a canonical Sūtra a nun called Vajirā declares that a living **being**
(*sattva*) is only a collection of conditioned factors (saṃskāra); the living **being**
itself is not found. Just as the word 'chariot' is used when the parts of the **chariot** are united, in the same way the expression 'living being' is used when all the aggregates (*skandha*) are present.135 The same comparison, and a reference to the nun Vajirā's words, is found in the Pāli version of the "Questions of **Milinda"**
(*Milindapañha*), which may date back to the second century BCE. 136 This **text**
describes a conversation between the monk Nāgasena and King **Menander** (Milinda), which starts as **follows:** 
Then King Milinda approached the venerable Nāgasena; having **approached,** he exchanged greetings with the venerable Nāgasena; and, **having** exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he sat down at a **respectful** distance. And the venerable Nāgasena greeted him in return so **that** he gladdened the heart of King Milinda. Then King Milinda spoke thus to the venerable Nā**gasena:**
"How is the revered one known? What is your name, revered **sir?"** "Sire, I am known as Nāgasena; fellow Brahma-farers address me, **sire,**
as Nāgasena: But though (my) parents gave (me) the name of Nā**gasena**
or Sūrasena or Vīrasena or Sīhasena, yet it is but a **denotation,** appellation, designation, a current usage, for Nāgasena is only a **name** since no person is got at **here."**
Then King Milinda spoke **thus:**
"Good sirs, let the five hundred Bactrian Greeks and the eighty **thousand** monks hear me: This Nāgasena speaks thus: 'Since no person is got at here.' Now, is it suitable to approve of **that?"** 
And King Milinda spoke thus to the venerable Nā**gasena:**
"If, revered Nāgasena, the person is not got at, who then is it that **gives** you the requisites of robe-material, almsfood, lodgings and **medicines** for the sick, who is it that makes use of them; who is [it] that **guards** moral habit, practises (mental) development, realizes the Ways, the fruits, Nirvāṇa; who is it that kills a living thing, takes what has not **been** given, goes wrongly amid the sense-pleasures, speaks lyingly, **drinks** toddy; and who commits the fivefold karma (the fruit of which **comes** with) no delay? Therefore there is not skill, there is not lack of **skill,** there is not one that carries out or makes another carry out actions **that** are skilled or unskilled, there is no fruit or ripening of actions well or ill done. If, revered Nāgasena, someone killed you there **would** be no onslaught on creatures for him. Also, revered Nāgasena, you **have** no teacher, no preceptor, no ordination. If you say: 'Fellow **Brahma-farers** address me, sire, as Nāgasena,' what here is Nāgasena? It is, revered **sir,** that the hairs of the head are Nā**gasena?"** "O no, **sire."** "That the hairs of the body are Nā**gasena?"** "O no, **sire."** "That the nails… the teeth, the skin, the flesh, the sinews, the bones, the marrow, the kidneys, the heart, the liver, the membranes, the spleen, the lungs, the intestines, the mesentery, the stomach, the excrement, the **bile,** the phlegm, the pus, the blood, the sweat, the fat, the tears, the **serum,** the saliva, the mucus, the synovic fluid, the urine, or the brain in the head are (any of them) Nā**gasena?"** "O no, **sire."** "Is Nāgasena material shape, revered sir?" "O no, **sire."** "Is Nāgasena sensation… ideation… the conditioned **factors?** Is Nāgasena **consciousness?"** "O no, **sire."** "But then, revered sir, is Nāgasena material shape and feeling and ideation and conditioned factors and **consciousness?"** "O no, **sire."** "But then, revered sir, is there Nāgasena apart from material **shape,** sensation, ideation, the conditioned factors and **consciousness?"** "O no, **sire."** "Though I, revered sir, am asking you repeatedly, I do not see **this** Nāgasena. Nāgasena is only a sound, revered sir. For who **here** is Nāgasena? You, revered sir, are speaking an untruth, a lying **word.** There is no Nā**gasena."**
Then the venerable Nāgasena spoke thus to King **Milinda:**
"You, sire, are a noble delicately nurtured, exceedingly **delicately** nurtured. If you, sire, go on foot at noon-time on the scorching **ground** and hot sand, trampling on sharp grit and pebbles and sand, your **feet** hurt you, your body wearies, your thought is impaired, and **tactile** consciousness arises accompanied by anguish. Now, did you **come** on foot or in a **conveyance?"** "I, revered sir, did not come on foot, I came in a **chariot."** "If you, sire, came by chariot, show me the chariot. Is the pole the chariot, **sire?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "Is the axle the **chariot?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "Are the wheels the **chariot?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "Is the body of the chariot the chariot… is the flag-staff of the **chariot** the chariot… is the yoke the chariot… are the reins the chariot… is the goad the **chariot?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "But then, sire, is the chariot the pole, the axle, the wheels, the **body** of the chariot, the flag-staff of the chariot, the yoke, the reins, the **goad?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "But then, sire, is there a chariot apart from the pole, the axle, the wheels, the body of the chariot, the flag-staff of the chariot, the yoke, the reins, the **goad?"** "O no, revered **sir."** "Though I, sire, am asking you repeatedly, I do not see the **chariot.** Chariot is only a sound, sire. For what here is the chariot? You, sire, are speaking an untruth, a lying word. There is no chariot. You, sire, are the chief king in the whole of India. Of whom are you afraid that you **speak** a lie? Let the five hundred worthy Bactrian Greeks and the **eighty** thousand monks listen to me: This King Milinda speaks thus: 'I **have** come by chariot.' But on being told: 'If you, sire, have come by chariot, show me the chariot,' he does not produce the chariot. Is it **suitable** to approve of **that?"**
When this had been said, the five hundred Bactrian Greeks, applauding the venerable Nāgasena, spoke thus to King Milinda: "Now do you, sire, **speak** if you can." Then King Milinda spoke thus to the venerable Nā**gasena:** 
"I, revered Nāgasena, am not telling a lie, for it is because of the **pole,** because of the axle, the wheels, the body of a chariot, the **flag-staff** of a chariot, the yoke, the reins, and because of the goad that 'chariot' **exists** as a denotation, appellation, designation, as a current usage, as a **name."**
"It is well; you, sire, understand a chariot. Even so it is for me, **sire,**
because of the hair of the head and because of the hair of the body… and because of the brain in the head and because of material shape and sensation and ideation and the conditioned factors and **consciousness** that 'Nāgasena' exists as a denotation, appellation, **designation,** as a current usage, merely as a name. But according to the highest **meaning** the person is not got at here. This, sire, was spoken by the nun **Vajir**ā face to face with the **Lord:**
Just as when the parts are rightly set The word 'chariot' is **spoken,** So when there are the **aggregates** It is the convention to say **'being'."**
"It is wonderful, revered Nāgasena, it is marvellous, revered Nā**gasena.** The explanations of the questions that were asked are very **brilliant.** If the Buddha were still here he would applaud. It is good, it is **good,** Nāgasena. The explanations of the questions that were asked are **very**
brilliant."137 Other early texts emphasize the non-existence of the self and of composite **objects**
in general. According to the Śāriputrā*bhidharma*, the self (pudgala / ā*tman*) is **only**
a name; the parts composing a person are not the self, and there is no self over and above these component parts. Here the self is likened to a hut. 'Hut' is but an empty word; its component parts are not a hut, and a hut over and above them **does**
not exist.138 The Mahā**-Vibh**āṣā - a text whose importance can be deduced **from**
the fact that the Sarvāstivādins in Kashmir also came to be known as Vaibhāṣ**ikas,**
'Adepts of the **Vibh**āṣā' - distinguishes between 'empirical existence' and
'existence through harmonious union'. The *pudgala* belongs to the latter **category,**
whereas pot, cloth, chariot, army, forest and hut illustrate 'empirical existence'. But only the dharmas have real existence.139 The *Visuddhimagga*, a text **belonging** to the Theravāda tradition composed in Ceylon in the 5th century CE,140 compares the terms 'living being' (*satta*) and 'person' (*puggala*) with expressions **such** as
'chariot', 'house', 'fist', 'sounds', 'army', 'town', 'tree' and characterises **them** as merely conventional designations.141 This development turned out to be of the greatest importance for the interpretation of the dharma theory. We saw that the dharmas had **come** to be considered as the component parts of the human person and of all other **objects** found in the world. This new development implied that only component parts **really** exist. Composite entities, whether they be the person or some other objects, do not really exist. Henceforth the list of dharmas is not only a list of all the buildingblocks of the world as it is known to us, but also a list of everything that exists. The dharmas therefore become *elements of existence*, and from now on **Buddhist**
doctrine includes an exhaustive ontology, a complete enumeration of all that **exists.** 
From the point of view of the Abhidharma Buddhists, then, only the dharmas really exist. The other objects that we know from everyday life do not really exist. This forces us to ask the question why and how we can all be **misled** into believing that they do exist. All human beings are convinced, for instance, **that** they live in a house, that they ride in a chariot, that they drink water from a **pot.** If all these objects do not really exist, where does this conviction spring from? The answer is very important for the subsequent history of thought in India, and has had a long-lasting influence on ontological thought, among Buddhists as well as non- Buddhists. It emphasizes the role of language in the construction of the **world** as we know it. As Nāgasena told King Menander, 'chariot' is only a **denotation,** an appellation, a designation, a current usage, a name, which is used when the required component parts are united, and the same holds for a person. The expression which is often used in this connection is *prajñapti* "designation". **From**
this point of view, the objects of the phenomenal world are "mere **designation"**
(prajñaptimātra). 

The world as conceived of in Abhidharma Buddhism now looks like **this.**
Dharmas make up all that there is. Only dharmas, these building-blocks of the world, really exist. Everything else - and this is especially true of **collections** of dharmas such as persons and macroscopic objects - does not really exist. The reason why all people accept the existence of non-real objects, such as chariots and pots, lies in language. In the end, such objects are mere words. In this regard, the texts often speak of "what exists in a limited sense" (saṃvṛ*tisat*) and "what **exists** in the highest sense" (paramā*rthasat*), or of "truth in a limited sense" (saṃvṛ*tisatya*)
and "truth in the highest sense" (paramā*rthasatya)*.

142 With respect to these **truths,**
the **Vibh**āṣā of the Sarvāstivādins remarks that in reality there is only one **truth,**
namely the highest. If one nevertheless distinguishes two truths, this is due to **one's**
point of view, not to the thing itself.143 The person is thus represented as a collection of dharmas. And we have **seen**
that most Buddhists concluded from this that the person does not exist, **because** collections do not exist. They believed that in doing so they were doing **justice** to the words of the Buddha, that declare that all dharmas are not the self. **This** interpretation played a central role in the development of the doctrine **according** to which no composite entities really **exist.** 
There was, however, a movement in Buddhist thought which was not satisfied with the rejection of the person. It came to be known as Pudgalavāda, and its proponents as Pudgalavādins "adepts of the doctrine according to which **there** is a person". We know but little about the origin and subsequent history of **this** movement. Their literature is almost entirely lost, and we are in part **obliged** to refer to the critical remarks of their opponents to learn the details of their **doctrine.**
The Pudgalavādins are mentioned in the canonical Vijñānakāya of the Sarvāstivādins and may belong to the oldest Buddhist schools.144 They were **still** in existence many centuries later: the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang reports in the **first** half of the 7th century CE that among all the schools in India the Pudgalavā**dins**
had the greatest number of followers.145 We do not have enough information to present the ideas of this **school** in a complete manner.146 Nevertheless we see that one theme recurs regularly. Our sources claim that the person is neither identical with the aggregates (*skandha*) nor different from them. It is neither inside nor outside the aggregates. **Sometimes** it is also described as identical with as well as different from the aggregates, the elements (dhātu) and the realms of the senses (ā*yatana*). These descriptions **show**
that, here too, the person was thought of as a collection of dharmas. The **followers** of this school, however, were not ready to conclude from this that the person was non-existent. Numerous canonical citations were used to show that the **Buddha** himself had often spoken of persons, which therefore had to **exist.** 
The Pudgalavādins were not satisfied with only canonical citations. The descriptions of the person cited above, in particular the first one, made it **possible** to present the belief in a person as a middle position between two extremes. The
*Tridharmakaśā*stra* of this school declares: "If the person (*sattva / pudgala*) is different from the dharmas, it is eternal; if it is identical to them, it is **non-eternal.**
These two mistakes should not be made."147 Here "non-eternal" should **probably** be taken in the sense of "momentary" (see below). Eternity and momentariness are the two extremes. Since the person is neither different from the dharmas, nor **identical** with them, these two extremes can be avoided. Another text of the school, the
*Sāṃmitīyanikāyaśā*stra*, adds: "If the person were identical with the **aggregates,** it would disappear or appear when the aggregates disappear or appear."148 **This**
confirms the hypothesis formulated above, namely, that in this context **non-eternal** means 'momentary'. For the aggregates are momentary, so that the person **would** be so likewise if it were identical with them. But in reality, the person does not disappear when the aggregates disappear, and this is what allows the person to **play** a role in connection with rebirth and liberation. These are indeed two **important** functions that the Pudgalavādins attribute to the person: for them rebirth and liberation do not imply a radical break, as they do for most other **Buddhists.**
We shall below see how the Sarvāstivādins - and most other Buddhists **with**
them - divided everything that exists into two kinds of dharmas, namely the conditioned (saṃskṛta) and the non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) ones. The **conditioned**
dharmas are momentary, the non-conditioned ones eternal. We know that the pudgala is situated between these two extremes. One might think that the *pudgala*,
if it really exists, must be a dharma, like everything else that exists. But then, **does**
the *pudgala* belong to the conditioned or to the non-conditioned dharmas? The masters of the Pudgalavāda school dealt with this question. They decided that the pudgala has its own special **category.** 
In the context of Indian Buddhism, the Pudgalavāda can **probably** be understood as an attempt to avoid a complete rupture with everyday reality. **Indeed,** it is the person who makes mistakes, whose activity calls for retribution, and who ultimately keeps the wheel of rebirth revolving. The teaching of the Buddha **itself** is useless without a person - or so the Pudgalavādins believed. But in spite of the efforts of this school, main-stream Buddhism continued to develop in the **direction** described above: it accepted the unreal nature of the person without **questioning,** and extended that unreal nature to the whole phenomenal world. **Subsequent** developments, which we shall examine in connection with the Mahāyāna, **further** deepen the gulf between the phenomenal world and reality. This tendency to **look** for the highest truth outside the phenomenal world, or even to deny its **existence** altogether, was peculiar to Buddhism and had no parallels in **Brahmanism** or Jainism in those days. It can best be explained by the fact that Buddhist **liberation** demanded a supreme insight whose contents, however, had not been fixed **clearly** by the tradition. In a certain sense, the Buddhists of those days were on the **lookout** for an insight, and therefore also for a reality which is hidden behind the phenomenal world. The existence of the Pudgalavāda school and the fact that it **still** had so many followers in the 7th century CE proves that the most **striking** development of Indian Buddhism, which led it ever further away from the phenomenal world, did not find universal approval among the monks, **some** of whom joined this **school.** 
Before turning to the systematisation of the dharma theory in Sarvāstivāda, let us briefly note that spiritual practice and cosmology were **already** interconnected in the old discourses, and, under their influence, in later **Buddhism**
as well.149 Buddhist cosmology cannot be described in detail here. This **cosmology,**
although important in itself, does not constitute Buddhist teaching in the **narrow** sense of the term, nor is it closely connected with it. The three planes of **existence**
(dhātu), also called worlds (avacara, *loka*) or realms of existence (*bhava*) - viz. the plane of desire (kā*madh*ātu), the plane of form (rū*padh*ātu) and the plane of the formless (ārū*pyadh*ātu) - are an exception. The plane of the formless is **related** to the four formless spiritual states (ārūpya), and the plane of form to the Four **Stages**
of Meditation (dhyāna). Nevertheless, these three planes of existence are **spatially**
arranged one above the other. The plane of the formless is situated above the others, and within it, the Realm of Neither Ideation nor **Non-ideation**
(naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā*yatana*) occupies the highest place.150 The relation **between**
the various spiritual states and the corresponding world-regions is **conceptualised** in such a manner that the meditating person gets access to the regions **concerned** by means of these practices. This way of homologising "internal" states and **"external"**
situations has parallels in other religions.151 But it is different from the **more**
rational tendencies characteristic of most later developments of Buddhist **thought** in India. The belief that states of meditation teach us something about the **constitution** of the world, however, also occurs later on. Systematising the dharma theory The dharma theory outlined above was merely a beginning, which **could** be happened in the so-called Sarvāstivāda school of Buddhism. This was not the **only** school which developed in the first centuries of the Buddhist religion; the **names** of several other schools have come down to us, and we shall briefly examine **various** points of doctrine of some of them. But first we must recall that only two of **these**
schools have preserved a complete 'Basket of Scholasticism' (Abhidharma-piṭaka):
the Theravādins and the Sarvāstivādins. Of these two, the latter is by far the **more** important for the subsequent development of Buddhism in India. The Sarvā**stiv**āda school is also the one that went furthest in systematising the dharma theory. It did so in its canonical Abhidharma-piṭaka, 152 and in various non-canonical **works.**
Fortunately, several of these non-canonical texts have been preserved in **Chinese** translations. 

We shall first examine the doctrine of momentariness. This doctrine is not the sole preserve of the Sarvāstivādins: it was soon taken over by other **Buddhist** schools. But in Sarvāstivāda it gave rise to some noteworthy **developments.** 
As the dharma theory developed, the following question **became**
unavoidable: how long do individual dharmas exist, or in other words, how **long** does it take before a dharma, after coming into existence, disappears again? The Buddhist thinkers sought an answer to this question in the transmitted words of the Buddha, and hit upon the theme of impermanence. Several textual passages **deal** with it. We have already come across it in the discourse which the **Buddha** is believed to have preached to his first disciples shortly after his **enlightenment.** There the Buddha said: "What do you believe, o disciples, is the physical **body** eternal or not eternal?" "Not eternal, Lord." "And that which is not **eternal,** is it suffering or bliss?" "Suffering, Lord." The same words are then **repeated** in connection with the four other aggregates (*skandha*). This passage shows that the old teaching of impermanence was closely related to suffering. It occurs **frequently** in the Canon, very often, as here, in relation with the aggregates and also with the dharmas in general. Another passage, for instance, specifies: "All the **conditioned** factors are impermanent, characterised by production and disappearance. **After**
being produced, they disappear."153 We have already seen that the **conditioned**
factors (saṃskāra), like the aggregates (*skandha*) themselves, had **come** to be looked upon as **dharmas.**
Certain Buddhists interpreted this to mean that the dharmas are **momentary:**
they last only a single moment.154 This new doctrine was not immediately **adopted**
by all Buddhists. It is not found in the Sūtra-piṭaka (Pa Sutta-piṭaka) of the Theravādins.155 It first appears in that school in the works of Buddhaghosa **(5th**
century CE).156 Certain Sarvāstivāda texts - e.g. the Saṃyuktābhidharmahṛ*daya* and the Mahā**-Vibh**āṣā - concede that the Buddha did not speak of moments.157 **Other**
schools believed that certain dharmas, though non-eternal, were not momentary.158 The doctrine of momentariness is of course highly compatible with the dharma theory. The latter denies the existence of composite objects: only **their** ultimate component parts, the dharmas, really exist. The doctrine of **momentariness** adds that temporally composite objects do not exist either: from a temporal **point** of view also only the ultimate component parts, i.e. the momentary dharmas, **exist.** 
We shall see that the doctrine of momentariness gave rise to **many**
theoretical discussions, first in the school of the Sarvāstivādins, later in **other**
schools as well.159 The doctrine of momentariness, although not attested in the old discourses, became an inseparable part of the dharma theory, and one which was accepted by most Indian Buddhists. The fact that several schools **made** an exception for a number of so-called non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) dharmas, **which**
are not momentary but eternal, is of minor importance in this **context.** We shall now examine the systematisation of the dharmas which has been **known**
as Pañcavastuka since Frauwallner gave it that name.160 It is a new **arrangement** of the dharmas in five categories. We know that earlier attempts had been **made** to give each dharma its place in schemes taken from the old discourses. These **were**
the Five Aggregates (*skandha*), further the Twelve Realms of the Senses (ā*yatana*) and the Eighteen Elements (dhātu). However, there were dharmas which did not fit
- or fitted only with the greatest difficulty - into these traditional categories. The Pañcavastuka now breaks with this tradition and proposes five new **categories.** We find this new classification in a text bearing the same name (*Pañcavastuka*),
preserved as part of the canonical *Prakara*ṇapāda and also independently. We **also**
find it in the older *Dharmaskandha*, which, too, belongs to the Sarvā**stiv**āda Abhidharma-piṭaka.

161 All the later Sarvāstivāda texts know this **systematisation,**
even if it occupies a secondary place in them, alongside the division into **Five**
Aggregates (*skandha*).

The Pañcavastuka, then, is a division of the dharmas into five objects (*vastu*)
or categories (*dharma*): (1) form (rūpa), (2) mind (*citta*), (3) mental **(dharmas)** (*caitta / caitasika*), (4) Conditioned Factors Separated from the **Mind**
(*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra), and (5) non-conditioned (dharmas) (asaṃskṛta). The dharmas numbered from (1) to (4) are conditioned (saṃskṛta), those in (5) are nonconditioned. 

As compared to the older classification in Five Aggregates (*skandha*) –
called Pañcaskandhaka by Frauwallner - the Pañcavastuka represented **clear** progress, because it could subsume and classify all the dharmas. **Nevertheless,** it was not a radical break from the five aggregates, for the aggregates have their **place** in the new Pañcavastuka, as follows. The first category of the Pañcavastuka, **form**
(rūpa), corresponds to the first aggregate which is likewise called rūpa. **Sensation** (*vedan*ā) and ideation (saṃjñā) lose their status as separate categories and **belong** now to the mental dharmas (*caitasika dharma*), the third category of the mind (*citta*), the second category of the Pañcavastuka. The **aggregate** of conditioned factors (saṃskāra) belongs primarily to the third category of **mental**
dharmas. But its name also lives on in the fourth category, that of the **Conditioned**
Factors Separated from the Mind (*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra). Indeed, **these**
Conditioned Factors Separated from the Mind are already in the old Dharmaskandha described as belonging to the aggregate of conditioned factors.162 But now certain dharmas which only with difficulty found a place in the old **system**
of Five Aggregates are included in this category.163 The same applies to the **fifth**
category, that of the non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) **dharmas.**
The creation of this new classification was a turning point in the development of Buddhist thinking. It testifies to the readiness to go **beyond** tradition and to reflect independently on Buddhist teaching. Wherever the traditional teaching showed weaknesses or deficiencies, there was a **willingness** to change it. 

This new way of dealing with the teaching is illustrated by certain **dharmas**
that figure in the Pañcavastuka. These dharmas were meant to solve **certain** difficulties which arose while systematising the doctrine. Let us look at **some** of them. 

The first "object" of the Pañcavastuka contains the dharmas which **belong** to the category of material form (rūpa). They are described as **follows:**
What is material form? The four great elements and [matter] **which** is dependent on the four great **elements.** 
What are the four great elements? The element earth, the element water, the element fire and the element **wind.** 
What is dependent material form? The eye-organ, the ear-organ, the noseorgan, the tongue-organ, the body-organ, form, sound, odour, flavour, a **part**
of that which can be touched and [the material form of] **non-information**
(*avijñapti*).164 Most of these dharmas are already known to us. Ten out of the Twelve **Realms** of the Senses (ā*yatana*) find a place here, namely the five organs, each with its **object.**
Only the mind (*manas*) and its object, the mental property (*dharma*), are not mentioned. This is understandable, for these two do not belong to the **category** "material form". Furthermore, the four great elements are present: earth, water, **fire** and wind. Their presence in the category "material form" is likewise not **surprising.**
The only element missing is space (ākāśa), but this is readily explained by the **fact**
that space was considered a non-conditioned and therefore eternal element. The Pañcavastuka keeps it in the fifth category, that of the non-conditioned **dharmas.** 
The last dharma listed here is completely different from the other **ones:** it is the dharma of non-information (*avijñapti*). The function of this dharma can **only** be understood in the light of the peculiar interpretation of the doctrine of **karma** in Buddhism. As we have seen, for the Buddhists karma is not only an action, but **also** an intention. An intention can cause a visible, but also an invisible action. In **this**
connection, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya speaks of a person who causes others to act without acting himself. In that person arises "non-information", which **forthwith** distinguishes him objectively and morally from another person who has not provoked such an action.165 Henceforth, this "non-information" sticks to him and accompanies him until the time when his action will be rewarded or **punished.** 
Other dharmas whose presence points to a further systematisation of the dharma theory are found in the fourth category of the Pañcavastuka, that of the Conditioned Factors Separated from the Mind (*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra).166 **This**
category is the most important innovation of the Pañcavastuka and was **created** with the aim of classifying those dharmas which could not easily find a place in the old Pañcaskandhaka.167 We have spoken above of the momentariness of the dharmas, citing in **that**
connection the old canonical phrase: "All the conditioned factors are **impermanent,** characterised by production and disappearance. After being produced, **they** disappear." In Pāli, "characterised by production and **disappearance"** is uppā*davayadhammino*. This expression contains the word dharma (Pa *dhamma*)
and could also be translated "[all conditioned factors] have production and disappearance as dharmas". It is unlikely that such a meaning was intended in the old days; *dharma* has several meanings, among them, characteristic or **quality.**
Nevertheless, at the time when the dharma theory was fully developed, **expressions** such as this one could easily give the impression that all the dharmas **were** accompanied by two more dharmas, namely the dharmas "production" and "disappearance". 

It looks as if this statement of the old Canon, and other similar ones, was indeed interpreted in this fashion.168 We find among the Conditioned **Factors**
Separated from the Mind (*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra) the following four **dharmas:** birth (jāti), old age (jarā), existence (*sthiti*) and impermanence (*anityat*ā). **There**
was no consensus as to the exact number of these so-called "characteristics of the conditioned" (saṃskṛ*talak*ṣaṇa): four or three.169 However that may be, these are the dharmas which are responsible for the production of other dharmas, for **their** momentary existence, and for their subsequent disappearance. The **existence** of these dharmas shows that the early Sarvāstivādins were preoccupied with the doctrine of momentariness. The example also shows to what extent **Buddhist** mentality had changed in the meanwhile. The concepts of birth, old age and impermanence were used in the old teaching to emphasise the suffering **that** is inherent in human existence. The same concepts are used here, but their **association** with suffering has completely disappeared. For our dogmatists, birth, old age and impermanence are dharmas, that is to say, entities accepted in their ontology **which,** like other dharmas, exist only for a moment and fulfil a certain function. We **will** see below that the aridity of this systematisation provoked a reaction in **other** Buddhists. This aridity, however, was not only a loss. Indeed, the case can be **made** that this very aridity with regard to feelings accompanied the birth of **rational** thinking in India. We shall come back to this **later.**
It is clear that a radical attempt was made to develop an ontology **which,**
although peculiar, does not contradict the world as we experience it. The issue was to determine what things really exist. Really existing things are **necessarily** dharmas. The complete list of dharmas should be able to explain our **everyday** "reality" - which as such does not really exist. We know that dharmas **have** a beginning, a duration and an end. The question presents itself whether **that** beginning really exists or not. If the answer is yes, then that beginning can **only** be a dharma. If the answer is no, then the dharmas are without beginning, and therefore not momentary. This type of argumentation is rigorously followed **with** respect to many questions. We find the first manifestations of this way of proceeding in the Pañcavastuka. It is further refined in the later history of the school. 

This subsequent refinement is illustrated by the discussion to which the above-mentioned dharmas gave rise. The question is: If all dharmas possess **birth,** old age, existence and impermanence, how about the dharmas birth, old **age,** existence and impermanence themselves? These dharmas, too, originate, exist and disappear, and they, too, should therefore be accompanied by these same **dharmas.** The later Sarvāstivādins agree with this, and some of them speak about the dharmas "birth of birth" (jātijāti), "existence of existence" (*sthitisthiti*), etc. **These**
new dharmas, however, are not themselves accompanied by further **dharmas** of birth, old age, existence and impermanence. This is not necessary, because the **first** birth also provokes the birth of birth, just as the birth of birth provokes the **first**
birth. The same is true of the remaining dharmas of this kind.170 Let us now turn to some other Conditioned Factors Separated from the Mind, namely to the "body-of-word" (nāmakāya), the **"body-of-sentence"**
(*padak*āya), and the "body-of-sound" (*vyañjanak*āya).171 The exact **explanation** of these expressions varies to some extent in the different texts which have **come**
down to us.172 But all agree that these are linguistic entities. The body-of-word, for instance, is the word seen as a unity, and it is not difficult to see what role **such** a body-of-word could play in the Buddhist world-view. For this world-view has no temporally extended objects, and therefore no place for words and similar **linguistic** entities. This was apparently a problem for the early Sarvāstivādins. Perhaps it was difficult to believe that there are no words at all, and therefore no words of the Buddha either. Later discussions among Buddhists show that this is **indeed** a possible explanation.173 But perhaps they were also thinking of the unreal **nature** of the everyday world, which, as we have seen, is caused by words: a **chariot** is in reality not observed, it is only a denotation, an appellation, a designation, a **current**
usage, a name, as Nāgasena states in the *Milindapañha*. But if the unreal **objects** of the everyday world are caused by words, then these words at least should **really** exist. Unfortunately, the old texts do not reveal to us why the Sarvāstivādins **held**
on to the existence of words and other component parts of language.174 **What** we can be certain about is that they were trying to solve the problem of the nonexistence of these language-entities by introducing the above-mentioned **linguistic** dharmas. 

The momentariness of the dharmas also gave rise to the following **problem.**
How can one claim that the innumerable dharmas which constantly appear and disappear have anything in common with each other? How can one **grasp** exhaustively this unending mass of dharmas with the limited number of **names**
contained in the Abhidharma of the Sarvāstivādins?175 The answer lies in the dharma named "community-of-being" (nikā*yasabh*āga, also sabhāgatā), which **also**
belongs to the Conditioned Factors Separated from the Mind. This community-ofbeing allows us to recognise an aggregate (*skandha*), etc., as such and to name it.

The same is true of the various types of beings.176 We see again that the claim **that**
there exists a community-of-being had the unavoidable consequence that it was added to the list of existing things as a momentary **dharma.**
The Pañcavastuka also mentions under the same fourth category the **dharma**
"obtaining" (prāpti). This is the last dharma we shall examine in this section. Its presence shows once again how the Sarvāstivādins attempted to make the **world** intelligible. A detailed description of this dharma is found, as so often, in the relatively late Abhidharmakośabhāṣya of Vasubandhu.177 According to this text, its existence is proved by the fact that an old discourse claims that by the **obtaining** of the ten dharmas belonging to an Arhat, the accomplished one becomes one who has abandoned the five members (aṅga).178 To understand this proof, it is not **important**
to know exactly which are the ten dharmas belonging to an Arhat and the **five**
members.179 The main point is that this passage mentions "obtaining". From **this,** it was concluded that something like "obtaining" actually exists, and **that** it is therefore a **dharma.** 
In the context of the Sarvāstivādins' world-view, the use of this **dharma** is as follows: As we have seen, there are no persons according to the **Abhidharma**
masters. The person is nothing but a collection, a sequence (saṃtāna / saṃ*tati*) of dharmas (and therefore does not really exist). Nevertheless, it is undisputable **that** different persons do not share the same dharmas: different sequences of **dharmas** make up different persons. It is also clear that the actions of a person have **their** effects within the sequence that makes up that same person. In other **words,** dharmas belong to specific persons. What is responsible for their attribution to one person rather than to another? How is the "unity", that is to say, the **"belonging**
together" of a sequence, guaranteed? This is achieved by the dharma "obtaining".180 This example shows once again how the negation of the person **determined**
to a considerable extent the development of Buddhist thought. It did so **positively** - we already know that the dharma theory, for instance, owes its existence to **that** doctrine. It also gave rise to problems, which the Buddhists sought to **solve** in various ways. We shall examine some of these solutions below. Here it **suffices** to note that, to a certain extent, the dharma "obtaining" (prāpti) plays the role **which**
would otherwise devolve upon the person. This role consists in somehow **keeping** together the dharmas that belong to one person, and in distinguishing them **from**
other persons.181 The dharma "obtaining" was also used for another purpose, at least in the later texts of the school. Wholesome (kuśala) and unwholesome (akuśala) **dharmas,**
as well as morally neutral (avyākṛta) ones - i.e., mind (*citta*) along with the **mental**
(caitta / *caitasika*) dharmas - alternate in a person's stream of thought. Does **this**
mean that wholesome moments of thought can call forth unwholesome **ones?** Naturally, this cannot be the case. The school does not concede either **that** wholesome and unwholesome moments of thought can simultaneously **appear** in one and the same person. How then is the alternation of morally different **moments** of thought to be explained? Here "obtaining" plays a useful role. For **when** an wholesome moment of thought appears, it is accompanied by its "obtaining". **Now,** when the wholesome moment of thought becomes part of the past, but **remains** in existence as a past dharma,182 its "obtaining" causes a series of **wholesome**
"obtainings". Subsequently, when an unwholesome moment of thought **becomes** present, then, even though the previous wholesome moment of thought has **become** past, its "obtaining" is present and coexists in the same person alongside the unwholesome moment of thought. Owing to this wholesome "obtaining" "its" **past** (but nevertheless existing) wholesome moment of thought can produce a new wholesome moment of thought.183 The dharmas discussed so far may have made it clear with how much **rigour**
the early Sarvāstivādins tried to develop and to systematise the dharma **theory.** These efforts continued over many centuries, so that later texts **such** as Vasubandhu's famous Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, which may belong to the early **fifth**
century,184 present a more refined system than the earlier texts. However, the examples discussed above belong to an early time. The Pañcavastuka is **already** present in a few canonical texts of the Sarvāstivāda, and all the dharmas **that** we have discussed have a place in it. Furthermore, the linguistic dharmas **appear** to have exerted an influence on the Brahmanical grammarian Patañjali, who **lived** in the second century BCE.185 This justifies the conclusion that the **detailed**
rationalisation of the dharma theory may have started in the second century BCE at the **latest.**
We turn to the non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) dharmas. The Sarvāstivā**dins**
recognised three of them, namely space (ākāśa), the "cessation not as a **result** of knowledge" (apratisaṃkhyā*nirodha*) and the "cessation through **knowledge"**
(pratisaṃkhyā*nirodha*). We have already observed that the **non-conditioned**
dharmas are eternal. The Sarvāstivādins looked upon space as a dharma, and therefore as something existing. The following can be said about the two **cessations**
(*nirodha*). It may happen that certain dharmas are not produced in the stream **which**
constitutes a personality, because the causes thereof are not present. **Liberating** knowledge has a similar effect: ignorance and other vices no longer occur in the personality stream; in the end the stream is completely interrupted. In both **cases,** the Sarvāstivādins explain this by accepting that there are two dharmas: **"cessation** not as a result of knowledge" and "cessation through knowledge". These **prevent** the appearance of those other dharmas through being connected with the personality stream,.186 The doctrine of momentariness gave rise to other questions than those which the Pañcavastuka tried to solve with the dharmas it contains. For if the world is **nothing** but a succession of distinct momentary dharmas, how can one explain the undeniable regularity of the **world?** 
The traditional answer to this question refers to the twelve-fold causal **series**
of Conditioned Origination (pratī*tyasamutp*āda), which we have met **while**
discussing the old teaching and which has the following form: "With (1) **ignorance** as condition, (2) conditioned factors [come to be]; with conditioned **factors** as condition (3) consciousness; with consciousness as condition, (4) **name-and-form;** with name-and-form as condition, (5) the six realms of the senses; with the the six realms of the senses as condition, (6) contact; with contact as condition, (7) sensation; with sensation as condition, (8) thirst; with thirst as condition, (9) clinging; with clinging as condition, (10) existence; with existence as **condition,** (11) birth; with birth as condition, (12) aging-and-death, sorrow, **lamentation,** suffering, displeasure, and despair come to be." We have seen that this **causal** series was interpreted in such a way that its members were distributed over **three**
births.187 The Abhidharma masters attempted to refine the understanding of **this**
causal series. In doing so, they became convinced that each of its twelve **elements**
was a state (daśā or *avasth*ā) of the Five Aggregates (*skandha*).188 The **Five**
Aggregates are the dharmas which constitute the personality. Seen in this way, the series of Conditioned Origination describes the causality which operates **between** these dharmas. Elsewhere it is said that all the conditioned dharmas are Conditioned Origination, in the sense that they produce all the dharmas **produced** in dependence.189 The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya explains that the conditioned **dharmas**
can be Conditioned Origination, in other words that the expression **"Conditioned** Origination" can refer to the dharmas, because the activity (origination) and the agent (that which originates) are not different from each other.190 This is true in the dharma theory, for this theory does not number activity among its dharmas: **only** the bearers of the activity of origination, i.e. the dharmas, really exist. The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya further explains that the other (i.e., the older) **interpretation**
of the law of Conditioned Origination was only propounded in order to put an end to people's confusion over past, present and future. In reality, the only **valid**
interpretation is the one which is adapted to the dharma theory.191 It is true that this new interpretation gives the dharmas their **due.**
Nevertheless it remains unsatisfactory. It does not explain exactly how the **dharmas** succeed one another at each moment. For this reason, attempts were made **early** to develop an independent doctrine of causality.192 Thus the canonical Vijñānakāya distinguishes four kinds of conditions (*pratyaya*): the producing condition (hetupratyaya); the support (ārambaṇa- or ā*lambana-pratyaya*) or object of **knowledge;**
the immediately contiguous condition (*samanantara-pratyaya*); and the determining condition (*adhipati-pratyaya*).193 The later but likewise **canonical**
Jñā*naprasth*āna introduces a subdivision into six causes, namely, the causal **reason** (kāraṇ*ahetu*), the concomitant cause (sahabhū*hetu*), the common **cause**
(sabhā*gahetu*), the co-operative cause (saṃ*prayukta(ka)hetu*), the **all-pervading**
cause (*sarvatragahetu*), and the reason for ripening (vipā*kahetu*).194 This new doctrine of causality is quite different from the old causal **series** of Conditioned Origination and represents a new and independent development.195 How can we reconcile the old series with the newly-developed ideas? In **this** connection it is interesting to mention the views of Saṃghabhadra. Saṃ**ghabhadra** was one of the younger contemporaries of Vasubandhu, the author of the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. Both authors probably lived in the fifth century of our **era.**
Saṃghabhadra's Nyāyānusāra contains certain ideas about causality **which**
Frauwallner describes as follows:196 According to Saṃghabhadra, causal activity can occur in two ways **among**
the conditioned dharmas (saṃskṛ*tadharma*): as cause (*hetu*) and as **condition**
(*pratyaya*). A cause brings about the arising of an effect, while **conditions**
contribute to the process. This is valid for internal as well as external **causal** processes. The difference between cause and condition is explained by **means** of the following example: the cause brings about, the conditions furthers, like the mother who bears the child and the foster-mother who brings it up. The **condition** fosters what the cause has brought forth, the conditions further its **development.**
In external causal processes, the seed is the cause for the arising of the sprout. Earth contributes as a condition. With the arising of the human **embryo,**
similarly, the first stage of development, the *kalala*, is the cause for the **arising** of the second, the *arbuda.* Consciousness (*vijñ*āna), which according to the law of Conditioned Origination brings about rebirth, contributes as a condition in the process. Although the *arbuda* does not arise independently of **consciousness,** it does not arise from consciousness as cause, because they each belong to **different** causal chains. However, neither can it be said that consciousness does not act as a condition at the arising of the *arbuda*, because its presence and non-presence are based on the former's presence and **non-presence.**
The last example shows how two elements of the old causal **chain** –
consciousness (*vijñ*āna) and name-and-form (nāmarūpa) - are related to **each** other. Consciousness produces name-and-form, but not as a cause (*hetu*), but as a condition (*pratyaya*). In this way the new doctrine of causality is used to **explain**
the old law of **causality.**
The doctrine of momentariness was, in Sarvāstivāda, only part of a **more**
comprehensive understanding of the problem of time. For the **doctrine** of momentariness only concerns the present. What about the past and the **future?** Do they exist as well, or does only the present really exist? At an early date, the Sarvāstivāda school had reached the conclusion that all three - past, present and future - really exist. Its very name expresses this: sarvāsti is composed of *sarva*
"everything" und *asti* "exists", because the adepts of the school held the view **that**
everything, whether in the past, the present or the future, exists.197 A canonical text, the Vijñānakāya, already cites various arguments in **favour**
of this school doctrine.198 These arguments resemble each other. They are all **based**
upon the conviction that two moments of mind or consciousness (citta, *vijñ*āna)
cannot occur simultaneously in a single person. The text does not say why **this** should be so, but this conviction is always presented as the unshakeable startingpoint of the discussion.199 It is not difficult to understand that some **noteworthy**
conclusions could be drawn from this. Consider the case where a **person**
contemplates his or her desire (*lobha*). Desire and contemplation are two **different**
mental states, which cannot therefore co-occur. This means that if the contemplation takes place in the present, the perceived desire cannot belong to the present. It can only belong to the past or to the future. But the Buddha has **declared** that desire exists. For desire to exist and to be contemplated, past and future **must**
also exist. Further arguments are added by later texts.200 One of these **arguments**
pertains to the circumstance that actions would otherwise have no effects, **which** would stand in absolute contradiction with Buddhist doctrine. The existence of the past also explains how a person, after sojourning for some time in the **state** of cessation (*nirodha*), in which there is no consciousness, can again **become**
conscious. The problem is that there is in such a case no continuity of **mental** dharmas, so that the dharmas which appear at the moment of **regaining** consciousness do not have any directly preceding mental dharmas which **could** cause them. The existence of the past, and therefore of past mental **dharmas,** explains their effectiveness over a **time-gap.** 
The position according to which past and future exist was **repeatedly**
debated in subsequent developments of the school. The topic is indeed a **recurrent**
one in its most important texts.201 The question which attracted most attention **was:**
what exactly differentiates a present dharma from the same dharma while in the past or future? The dharmas were thought to travel through the different time **zones**
(*adhvan*): from the future they travel into the present, and from the present into the past. The question how to explain this received various answers. The **opinions** of four teachers - Dharmatrāta, Ghoṣaka,202 Vasumitra, and Buddhadeva - are regularly cited. Dharmatrāta held that it is their state (bhāva) which **differentiates**
the dharmas in the various time zones. For Ghoṣaka the characteristics (lakṣaṇa)
are responsible: a past dharma is linked with the characteristic of the past, **without** being devoid of links with the characteristics of the future and present; **analogous** conditions hold for present and future dharmas. According to Vasumitra, it is the position (*avasth*ā) which differentiates the three types of dharmas, like **calculation**
sticks (*vartik*ā), which, depending on their position, have the value of one, one hundred or one thousand.203 According to Buddhadeva, finally, the various **dharmas**
are differentiated by their relation to earlier and later dharmas, just as one and the same woman can be a mother and a daughter, depending on the relationship one has in mind.204 This idea of dharmas travelling through time zones was **subsequently**
abandoned, probably because it presupposes the existence of time. The Sarvāstivādins did not recognise time as something that exists. In their **attempt** at avoiding the difficulty, they accepted the following solution. Future, present and past dharmas are differentiated by their efficiency (kā*ritra*). If this efficiency has not been activated yet, then the dharmas are future. If it is active, then they are present. And if it has passed, then they are past. The time zones do not really **exist;** they are really nothing but the dharmas existing in the past, the present and the future. 

The theory of efficiency as a decisive element in the temporal position of the dharmas was further investigated and refined by the Sarvāstivādins.205 It is important to remember that according to these thinkers the existence of past and future dharmas is as real as that of present ones. In other words, a dharma's own nature (*svabh*āva) is eternal, even though its manifestation in the present is **only**
momentary.206 These developments of the dharma theory are all linked with the **doctrine** of momentariness. This doctrine is based on an atomic conception of time. **Time** is thought of as a never-ending series of moments, which cannot be **further** subdivided. We have already seen how well such a conception fits the **dharma** theory, which denies the existence of composite **entities.** 
The denial of composite entities did not only lead to an atomic **conception** of time, it also led to an atomic conception of material form. For each **composite** entity has parts which are, as a rule, also composite, and which therefore do not really exist. This might be used as an argument to prove that the division of **matter** can continue endlessly without ever producing anything that really exists, and **that** therefore nothing really exists in the material world. This argument was **indeed** used in certain later developments of Buddhism, but the Sarvāstivādins were not attracted by it. They were not seeking to prove the unreality of the material **world.** On the contrary, the dharma theory claims to describe the reality behind the **unreal** everyday objects. The Sarvāstivādins were therefore forced to admit that the subdivision of matter must stop at some point. It stops at the smallest **component** parts of matter, the **atoms.**
There can be no doubt that the atomic representation of matter became **part**
of the world-view of the Sarvāstivādins at an early date. One cannot imagine **that** these Buddhists would investigate in detail the consequences of the **doctrine** of momentariness without bothering about the atomic structure of matter. The **latter** is, after all, a direct consequence of their doctrine of the **non-existence** of composite objects. Nevertheless, it appears that atoms are not mentioned in **their** canonical texts. This can probably be explained by the circumstance that **material** atoms are not new dharmas, and do not provide reasons for postulating new dharmas, as happened in the case of the doctrine of momentariness. The **canonical** texts primarily concentrate on listing and discussing dharmas; atoms do not contribute anything new to this: like everything else, atoms are **composed** of dharmas.

Atoms are mentioned in Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Abhidharmahṛ*daya,* **which**
belongs to the early centuries of the Common Era and is probably the oldest noncanonical Sarvāstivāda text that has come down to us.207 This text explains the relationship between atoms (*param*āṇu) and dharmas, in the following manner.208 A
distinction is drawn between three types of atoms: first the atoms which **belong** to the four sense faculties (*indriya*), viz. eye, hearing, smell and tongue; then the atoms which are found in the sense organ which is the body; and last all the remaining atoms. The atoms of the four senses are composed of ten dharmas **each.**
The atom of the eye, for instance, contains earth (pṛ*thiv*ī), water (ap), fire (*tejas*), wind (vāyu), form (rūpa), odour (*gandha*), flavour (*rasa*), the tangible (spraṣṭ*avya*),
the sense faculty of the eye (cakṣ*urindriya*), and the sense faculty of the **body**
(kā*yendriya*); something similar holds for the remaining senses, i.e. hearing, **smell**
and tongue. The atoms of the sense organ of the body contain nine dharmas, **viz.,** the same as in the above-mentioned example of the eye, without the sense **faculty**
of the eye (cakṣ*urindriya*). The remaining atoms, which are not senses, **contain**
eight dharmas each, namely the ones which are listed above, with the **exception** of the last two. The text adds that all this is valid for the plane of desire (kā*madh*ātu).

On the plane of form (rū*padh*ātu), since it contains neither odour nor flavour, **each**
atom has two dharmas less. The Sarvāstivādins, moreover, do not concede any spatial extension to their atoms.209 Strictly speaking, atoms cannot be the ultimate components of matter, for they are composite themselves. The really ultimate components are the **dharmas.** This is indeed what we should expect in the light of the dharma theory. There is, however, a problem: the atoms which are not senses all have the same **composition.** In spite of this, they sometimes behave as earth, sometimes as water, or as **fire,** or as wind. In other words, some of these atoms are hard (kaṭ*hina*), others are **liquid** (*drava*), hot (uṣṇa) or mobile (*samud*īraṇa). The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya **explains**
this as follows. The dharmas of earth, water, fire and wind which are **contained** in the atoms can predominate more or less strongly (paṭu). The property **which**
predominates most strongly is the one which is perceived.210 In this conceptualisation of matter, it is hard to maintain that **there** is a difference between substances and properties. If we consider the **atom** as a substance, we must admit that this substance is nothing but a **collection** of momentary dharmas. We might feel tempted to call some of these dharmas - **such** as form, etc. - properties, others - such as earth - substances. But **this** differentiation makes no sense. Both kinds of dharmas are momentary, and one dharma is not the property of another. We have also seen that the dharmas **earth,** water, fire and wind manifest themselves as the properties hardness, fluidity, **heat** and movement. The Buddhists themselves were aware of the **absence** of differentiation. The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya deals with the question in the following words:211 "(Opponent:) Atoms are substances (*dravya*), which are different from the properties form, etc. Therefore, they do not necessarily **have** to vanish at the same time. (Answer:) The essential difference of these two **need** in no way be considered as proved. For if we examine them, there is no special **earth,** etc., apart from form, etc. Therefore they are not fundamentally **different."** 
Sarvāstivāda, then, developed an atomistic world-view in which the difference between substances and properties was lost. As long as we **speak** of dharmas, one might say that their system knew only properties and no **substances.** But as soon as the atoms, which are substances, enter the picture, we must **conclude** that in the Sarvāstivādins' world-view the substances were nothing but accumulations of **properties.** 
We have already noted that the Sarvāstivādins' doctrine of atoms **must** be old: as old as, or perhaps even older than their doctrine of momentariness. **This** conclusion cannot be reached on the basis of textual evidence: in the last **analysis,** it only rests on reflections about the internal logic of the development. **Such** conclusions are dangerous, and should be drawn with utmost care. **However,** we have also seen why the doctrine of atoms could not possibly appear in the **canonical** texts even if it already existed. Besides, it is impossible to imagine that the **thinkers** who had started to elaborate the doctrine of momentariness at an early date **would** not have hit upon the idea of atoms. This idea, even more than the **doctrine** of momentariness, was directly derived from the dharma **theory.** 
We may wonder why the Buddhists of that time rushed into the **elaboration**
of an ontology. We know the Buddha's negative attitude towards **metaphysical** thought. Had the later Buddhists suddenly got rid of this aversion, so as to **dedicate** themselves wholeheartedly to philosophical **questions?**
The situation is not quite so simple. It is true that philosophical **investigation**
gained a foothold in Buddhism through the developments outlined above, and **that** subsequently Buddhism became a kind of motor for Indian philosophy in **general.** Nevertheless, we should not misunderstand the activity of the **Abhidharma** specialists. Their first concern was to preserve the Buddha's message and to interpret it correctly. Besides, the idea that the Buddha had taught the dharmas had become widely accepted. Thus we read in the Mahā**-Vibh**āṣā: "Pārśva says: the Buddha knows the nature and function of all the dharmas."212 And already a Sūtra passage declares that the Buddha teaches all the dharmas without exception. **What** this passage exactly means by "all the dharmas" is subsequently explained: it is the list we have become acquainted with as the "Dharmas Helpful to **Enlightenment** "
(bodhipākṣ*ika dharma*).213 The statement that one cannot put an end to **suffering**
without knowledge of all the dharmas was likewise attributed to the **Buddha:** "I declare that one cannot put an end to suffering as long as there remains **even** a single dharma which is not known and rightly understood."214 By understanding the dharmas, one can practise the Four Noble Truths, understand **Conditioned** Origination, know the vices and isolate them, provoke their destruction and **thus**
reach Nirvāṇa.215 This is why the Buddhists were so concerned with identifying and describing all the dharmas. The philosophical development was somehow a byproduct. One could almost say that it happened by chance, that is, **without** conscious intention. We shall examine this development in more detail below. **Here** it is important to stress that the old canonical Abhidharma texts cannot be **read** as philosophical works. The absence of philosophical thought in many of them has been emphasized by researchers.216 The philosophical dimension remained in the background for a long time, and made its appearance only **gradually.** 
When it did appear, it became necessary to deal with the question **how,**
exactly, liberation is obtained. And inevitably, the Buddhists sought for an **answer** that would be satisfying in terms of the dharma **theory.** 
Dharmaśreṣṭhin was perhaps the first to attempt to answer this **question** in detail.217 His main problem was an old one, and one which we have **encountered**
repeatedly. It is the question of how knowledge can lead to liberation. This **problem** had been the constant companion of Buddhism from its inception, and had **only** gained in importance when attempts were made to determine the exact **content** of this knowledge. We have seen, for instance, how the rejection of the **knowledge** of a self as a means to liberation had been modified in such a way that the **knowledge** of the non-self itself became a liberating knowledge. This knowledge of the nonself was such that its relation to the problem of rebirth was obvious **because** it implied non-identification with those parts of the personality which take **part** in activities. We have also seen how ignorance, i.e. incorrect knowledge, is **presented** as the primary condition for rebirth in the doctrine of Conditioned **Origination.** If ignorance is the primary condition for rebirth, it is clear that only **correct** knowledge can put an end to it. 

Dharmaśreṣṭhin follows a path which resembles the doctrine of **Conditioned**
Origination, in the sense that he too believes that the main problem can be **located,**
at least to a certain extent, in the presence of false **views** (dṛṣṭi). He **distinguishes** five of these. They are the belief in the existence of the personality (satkāyadṛṣṭi), the belief which is attached to extremes (antagrāhadṛṣṭi), just the wrong **view** (**mithy**ādṛṣṭi), the clinging to false **views** (dṛṣṭiparāmarśa), and the **clinging** to ceremonial practices (śīlavrataparāmarśa). These five views belong to a list of ten attachments (anuśaya), which contains five additional elements, namely **passion**
(rāga), doubt (*vicikits*ā), repugnance (*pratigha*), pride (māna), and **delusion** (*moha*). This list of ten attachments is probably a new creation, but it uses **elements**
taken from the old discourses and rearranges them. These attachments are of two kinds: one can get rid of six of them - viz., the five views and doubt - by **means** of discernment (darśana), and of the remaining four by means of practice and contemplation (bhāvanā). The objects of this discernment and contemplation are the Four Noble Truths, which are already well-known to us. Liberation takes **place** when all ten attachments have been **eliminated.**
In their urge to systematise, the Buddhist dogmatists, and Dharmaśreṣṭhin in particular, found it hard to speak of the destruction of the ten attachments by **means** of the knowledge and contemplation of the Four Noble Truths without **exactly** indicating which truth was connected with the elimination of which **attachment.** It was assumed that a knowledge eliminates those attachments which have the **same** object as that knowledge. In this fashion, the attachments which must be **eliminated** by means of insight fall into four groups: they must be eliminated either by **insight** into suffering, by insight into the origin of suffering, by insight into the end of suffering, or finally by insight into the path leading to the end of suffering. **This** because the Four Noble Truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of the **origin** of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the end of suffering. Since most attachments can be directed at more than one **object,** and taking into account the three spheres in which the Buddhists divide the **world,** the attachments were finally subdivided into ninety-eight varieties. 

The insight into the Four Noble Truths was likewise subdivided **into** a succession of individual moments. For each truth, four "paths" were **distinguished,** which occupy one moment each. The entire liberating process of knowledge, the vision of the truth (dharmā*bhisamaya*), covers in this way sixteen **moments** of knowledge. Contemplation (bhāvanā) is practised before as well as after the liberating knowledge but it only takes effect through that knowledge. In this way the decisive significance of the path of discernment (darśanamārga) is **assured.** However, only the path of contemplation (bhāvanāmārga), which follows the **path**
of knowledge, can bring final **liberation.**
What is the connection between the path leading to liberation and knowledge of all the dharmas? In order to answer this question, we must **examine** the beginning of the path. Here, the Four Applications of **Mindfulness**
(smṛ*tyupasth*āna) are mentioned.218 In Dharmaśreṣṭhin's representation, the **disciple**
first contemplates the body (kāya) as impure, impermanent, painful and not the self, according to its characteristic marks. Then he contemplates in the **same**
fashion the sensations (*vedan*ā), the mind (*citta*), the mental dharmas (**caitta /** caitasika dharma), the Conditioned Factors Separated from the **Mind**
(*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra), and the dharmas in general. We recognise the **four**
categories of conditioned dharmas as they are enumerated in the **Pañcavastuka.** These dharmas are contemplated in the applications of mindfulness, first in **their** subdivision into categories and then all together. These **applications** of mindfulness, however, are the precondition for the next steps on the **path** to liberation, as it is from them that certain roots of the wholesome (kuś*alam*ūla) are produced. These then make the liberating process possible. In other **words,**
liberation is not possible without knowledge of all the dharmas.219 The structure of Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Abhidharmahṛ*daya* **appears** to be determined by the Four Noble Truths.220 This would mean that correct **knowledge**
of the Four Noble Truths - i.e., liberating knowledge - implies knowledge of the dharmas. 

Note at this point that in Dharmaśreṣṭhin's representation of the path **leading**
to liberation there is no mention of meditation at all. In particular, the Four **Stages**
of Meditation (dhyāna) are missing. The same is also true for the **stages** of attainment (samā*patti*), which had gained an important position in **Buddhist**
teaching, although they did not originally belong to it. The absence of these **stages** of meditation in Dharmaśreṣṭhin's path leading to liberation is all the more **striking** as the same stages play a major role in his cosmology. We have already seen **that** the cosmology of all Buddhists was influenced by these stages. It is thus **doubly** interesting to see that, in the case of the Sarvāstivādins, they only survived in **their**
cosmology, and played no role in their path to liberation.221 We have so far only dealt with three Buddhist schools: primarily the **so-called** Sarvāstivāda, and in passing the Theravāda and the Pudgalavāda. These, **however,** were not the only schools that existed. We shall presently say something **about** some of the other schools. It is important to note that these schools, as the **word** is used here, are distinguished from each other by divergent doctrinal opinions. **Apart**
from schools, Buddhism also has sects or groups (nikāya). H. Bechert describes the meaning of this word for modern Theravāda in the following terms:222 **"Those**
monks belong to one and the same Nikāya who recognise reciprocally and **without** reservation the validity of their ordination, and who perform together formal **legal** acts in the spirit of the order's rule or 'communal negotiations'." The situation was probably not very different during the early centuries of Buddhism. The **initial** points of dispute between Nikāyas, if there were any, mainly concerned the interpretation and application of Vinaya-prescriptions.223 This is why we **speak** of
'Vinaya schools'. Certain doctrinal opinions developed within, and **remained** associated with certain Nikāyas. Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda are examples: **they** were and remained 'Vinaya schools', each with its own works on Vinaya, **within** which Buddhist doctrine developed in its own specific way. But doctrinal **positions** do not always need their own Nikāya, and inversely, Nikāyas do not always **need** distinctive doctrinal positions. The Pudgalavādins appear to have used the **monastic** rules of the Sarvāstivādins. If this is true, Pudgalavāda was from the **start** a philosophical school, not a Vinaya school.224 In this volume we are more interested in philosophical schools **than** in Vinaya schools. The names of many philosophical schools are known to us, but for the details of their teachings we depend on sources that are much more recent **than** the schools themselves. If we can trust those sources, then the differences **between** these teachings almost always concerned details of dogma. It is possible and **even** likely that many of these schools had started as Nikāyas, i.e. Vinaya schools, and did not develop their own teachings until later. It is impossible to discuss all of these schools and their teachings here, and it would also not be useful.225 We **shall**
rather concentrate on only one of them, namely the one whose adepts **called**
themselves Sautrāntikas. The history of this school is not known in detail,226 but it seems to be primarily a reaction against Sarvāstivāda. The famous **work** of Vasubandhu, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, often mentions positions of Sautrā**ntikas**
next to those of the Sarvāstivādins. The author then mostly takes sides with the former. This is not tantamount to saying that Vasubandhu always presents the scholastic positions of the Sautrāntikas correctly; sometimes he rather seems to use this name to refer to his own opinions.227 The most important doctrines of the Sautrāntikas are the following:228 **They**
take exception to the Sarvāstivāda doctrine concerning the reality of past and future; only the present really exists. The non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) **dharmas** do not really exist either. The same is true of the Conditioned Factors Separated **from**
the Mind (*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra).229 Denying the reality of past and future has certain consequences. The existence of the three times allowed the Sarvāstivādins to explain how past **mental** dharmas can have an effect much later. We have seen this in connection **with**
"obtaining" (prāpti), and also in our discussion of the reawakening from the **state**
of cessation (*nirodha*). Although temporally distinct from each other, **former**
dharmas exist at the time of their effect. Such an explanation was not possible for the Sautrāntikas, who did not recognise the existence of past and future, nor **that** of "obtaining". They were obliged to explain the relation between earlier and **later** dharmas differently. They tried to do this by assuming the existence of **"seeds"**
(bīja).230 Unlike "obtaining", seeds are not independently existing entities; **rather,**
they are the aggregates (*skandha*), i.e., the dharmas which make up a person. But they have the capacity to produce certain dharmas, and are thus able to **establish** a relation with earlier dharmas. With the help of these seeds, it was no **longer** necessary to postulate a direct effect of past **dharmas.** 
Other doctrines of the Sautrāntikas cannot be mentioned here. Those **listed**
so far suffice to show how much this school opposed the Sarvāstivāda, but at the same time, how much its way of thinking was conditioned by that of the Sarvāstivāda. However, the system of Sarvāstivāda thought did not **survive** in Sautrāntika. It is perhaps no coincidence that, according to tradition, **Vasubandhu,**
the author of the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, soon abandoned this school and **joined**
the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna. Concluding observations In the preceding pages we have examined the Sarvastivādins' **systematisation** of the dharma theory. We noted that nothing similar is found in the **preserved** Abhidharma texts of the Pāli school. Erich Frauwallner, the Austrian scholar who opened up the field of Abhidharma in his *Studies in Abhidharma Literature*, contrasts a Sarvāstivāda text, Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Abhidharmahṛ*daya*, with **some** texts of the Pāli school, Upatissa's *Vimuttimagga* and **Buddhaghosa's**
Visuddhimagga, in the following words:231 "In the former, we find a **doctrinal**
system, theoretical considerations and clear, systematic thought. In the **latter** we have a path to liberation, practical considerations and a good deal of **imagination."** Although the Sarvāstivādins' early texts cannot compare in its **degree** of systemization with the Abhidharmahṛ*daya*, it is certain that, ever since the introduction of the Pañcavastuka, the Sarvāstivāda tradition has **fundamentally** distinguished itself from the Pāli school in its attempt to order the **doctrine**
systematically. Indeed, the Kathā*vatthu*, a text belonging to the Pāli school, in its criticism of the main doctrine of the Sarvāstivādins according to which past and future do not exist, clearly reveals that its author hardly knew that doctrine and the arguments that support it, and certainly did not understand it correctly.232 What is meant here by *systematising* has probably become clear after our discussion of the various elements of Sarvāstivāda doctrine. Many of **these** elements purport to safeguard the doctrine; i.e., to make it autonomous and internally consistent. It is, or at least tries to be, a system in the sense that its elements are coherent and corroborate each other: the Sarvāstivādins took **pains** to shape their doctrine in such a way that critical questions could be answered. The doctrine was *rationalised*, i.e., the attempt was made to make it resistant **against**
rational **attacks.** 
This suggests that the Sarvāstivādins did indeed have to defend **their**
doctrine against rational attacks. Rational attacks are radically different from **other** types of attacks. A religious doctrine can for instance be forbidden, or its **adepts** can be persecuted. Or the doctrine can lose influence through social or **political** developments. Rationalisation is of no help against such attacks. **Rationalising** a doctrine only helps in cases where the adepts of this doctrine feel **threatened** by disputes with those who think differently. This presupposes a situation where **those** who think differently are ready to listen to the proponents' doctrine, and **where** they are themselves listened to. Strengthening one's own doctrine **through** rationalization is only useful in such **situations.** 
The later history of Indian philosophy repeatedly illustrates how a **rational**
tradition, once it has gained a foothold, can influence or even completely **change** doctrinal positions. It is not at all certain that such a rational tradition **already** existed in India when the Sarvāstivādins started their systematisation. The development of the Pāli school shows that the need for rationalisation was not equally strong in every part of India. As Erich Frauwallner says:233 **"The** Pāli school demonstrates that the process of development in the Sarvāstivāda **school** was by no means the rule and that things could take quite a different course." The debates found in Vedic literature, particularly in the Upanishads, also have **little** to do with rational exchanges. Walter Ruben contrasts them to later rational **debates:** "The type of debates found in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka- and Chāndogya-Upaniṣ**ads,** which is the same as that in the Brāhmaṇas, is completely different from the **later** type of debates. In later debates, one protagonist proposes a thesis, the **opponent** proposes another thesis, and then both refute each others' theses with counterarguments and defend their own view, until one of the theses proves to be **right.** But in the old Upanishads or in the Brāhmaṇas, one person asks questions and the other answers, until the first has nothing more to ask, or the second no **longer** knows how to answer: the winner is the one who has the last say. We could sum this up by means of the following formula: in the old Upanishads one had to **know** more, in later times one had to know better. In the old Upanishads, the point is not to fight for the victory of one theory and against another, wrong, theory, as it **later**
sake - is to establish who is the greatest Brahmin, who knows the most."234 **These**
remarks leave no doubt that the Vedic debates had little to do with rationality in our sense of the term. In these circumstances, how can we explain the **rational** developments within the Sarvāstivāda **school?**
We have noted above that the rationalisation of Sarvāstivāda teaching had begun before the middle of the second century BCE at the latest. At that time the Pañcavastuka, and most of the dharmas it contains, were part of this **school's** teaching. The geographical location of the school in those days is well **known:** it was a missionary school, which owed its existence to Aśoka's missions. **Already** in the oldest times this school belonged to the north-west of the Indian **subcontinent.** The Pāli school was also a missionary school, but one which, in all **probability,**
developed in and around the town of Vidiśā, nowadays Gwalior.235 What **difference**
between Gandhāra and Vidiśā could possibly explain the Sarvāstivādins' **attempts** at rationalising, and its absence in the Pāli **school?** 
One important fact is that there were Greek kingdoms in the **north-west** of India during the centuries preceding the Common Era. The rational **tradition** in Greek and Hellenistic culture is well-known. Hellenistic kings liked to **take** a personal interest in philosophy and other forms of knowledge. Wise men frequented the court, and it appears that the kings debated with them.236 We **know**
that the inhabitants of the Greek kingdoms in the north-west of India held to **their** Hellenistic culture, which included Greek thought. Indeed, a Greek **philosopher** named Clearchus, a direct pupil of Aristotle, visited that region at the **beginning** of the third century BCE.237 Besides, archaeological excavations have brought to **light** a Greek philosophical papyrus.238 In spite of their own lack of interest in Indian culture,239 the Greeks in northwest India exerted a deep influence on the Buddhist visual arts.240 We cannot **rule** out that the Buddhists were also indebted to the Greeks in other respects.241 It would be especially interesting to know whether the Buddhists had **regular** discussions with the Greeks, and whether it was through these that they **learnt** to present their positions in such a manner that an outsider could not reject **them** as incoherent. 

It may be impossible to *prove* Greek influence of this nature. For we are not looking for specific Greek ideas in Sarvāstivāda thought. The situation is **more** abstract, and therefore more complicated. It is highly unlikely that the **Buddhists,** who themselves had inherited a rich store of ideas, would simply have taken **over** ideas from the Greeks; indeed we find no trace of this. The question is **rather**
whether they learned the art of rational discussion from the Greeks.242 **This**
hypothesis would make the shape of their teaching substantially **more** understandable. Furthermore, Buddhist literature contains no trace of **acquaintance** with the Greeks, whom the Buddhists in the north-west must yet have **known.** There is one exception, and this exception concerns, nota bene, a **discussion** between a Greek king and a Buddhist monk about religious questions. This is the famous *Milindapañha*, the "Questions of Milinda", cited above. Although **there** is little in this text which is Greek besides the name of the king,243 its very **existence** is a testimony that Buddhists and Greeks discussed religious and related **questions,** or at least that the Buddhists remembered the Greeks as partners in **discussions.** It is therefore legitimate to postulate Greek influence on the Sarvāstivā**dins.** 
From this early time onwards, a rational element found its way **into**
Buddhist thinking. This does not mean that Indian Buddhism has developed in **only** a "rational" way ever since: this is certainly not the case, as we shall see **below.** It means that from time to time thinkers tried to present the Buddhist doctrine of **their** respective schools in a coherent way, i.e., in a way that would resist **rational** attacks. Moreover, more and more discussions took place with people who **held** different opinions, whether they were Buddhists or not. In other words, a **tradition** of rationality established itself. And where there is a rational tradition, it **becomes** more difficult for divergent opinions to coexist without influencing each other. For the main characteristic of a rational tradition is that the different parties **listen** to each other. This certainly does not mean that one is convinced by the other. On the contrary, an exchange of ideas can emphasise or even bring to light **differences** which played no role before. Nevertheless, the likelihood of mutual **influence** is increased. This influence can take various forms. Particularly interesting are reactions against a specific system, giving rise to currents of thought which do not agree with a part, or even with the totality of another one. If these reactions are produced in rational exchanges, they can give rise to new systems of **thought.** As we have seen, this may have happened in the case of the Sarvāstivāda **system,** which may have come about in an attempt to arm itself against Greek criticism, **real** or imagined. Criticism of Sarvāstivāda, in its turn, gave rise to new systems **within** Buddhism and Brahmanism. The next chapter will show **this.**

# 4. Mahāyāna

## Early Mahāyāna

The oldest Buddhist texts make no distinction between the Buddha's liberation and that of his disciples. In both cases the word *arhat* is used, which we have **translated**
as 'accomplished one'. Everyone who has attained liberation, including the Buddha, is called an Arhat. This changed later. Dissention arose as to what **exactly**
characterises an Arhat, and whether or not an Arhat can again lose his Arhatship.244 These controversies did not concern Buddhahood. Already in the old Sūtras, the Buddha was said to possess distinctive signs and powers which Arhats lack,245 and these were further emphasised in the school of the so-called Mahāsāṃghikas.246 In this school, the Buddha's activities were considered to be illusory. The **connection** between this belief in the Buddha's essential non-activity and the link between nonactivity and karmic retribution exposed at the end of Chapter Two is obvious but cannot be further explored here. In more conservative schools, too, features **such** as omniscience were ascribed to the Buddha, but denied to the Arhat.247 It is understandable that certain Buddhists were no longer satisfied with **Arhatship** as a goal, and rather sought to achieve the higher goal of Buddhahood. And just as the old texts call the historical Buddha before his enlightenment a 'being **destined** to enlightenment' (*bodhisattva*),248 likewise, these Buddhists did not merely **want** to follow the 'Path of the Listeners' (śrā*vakay*āna), but rather the 'Path of **Beings**
Destined to Enlightenment' (*bodhisattvay*āna).249 These were primarily personal and private decisions. Inscriptions show **that**
this new movement remained a minority movement for several centuries.250 Inscriptions also suggest that this movement came to find its principal **support** in the community of monks, and not among the laymen. However, this does not necessarily rule out the hypothesis that the movement began among the laity.251 The role of women seems to have been negligible in this.252 Even before the **beginning** of the Common Era, the movement began to develop its own writings.253 **Along**
with the designation 'Path of Beings Destined to Enlightenment' (*bodhisattvay*āna),
the name Mahāyāna 'Great Path' is also frequently used.254 It is to be **distinguished**
from the Path of the Listeners (śrā*vakay*āna), also called the Low Path (hīnayāna)
by its opponents.255 Mahāyāna, then, is first and foremost characterised by the **aspiration** to attain perfect Buddhahood rather than to gain enlightenment as an Arhat. In **what** way does the career of beings destined for enlightenment differ from **that** of listeners? Details of the career of the Buddha Śākyamuni - i.e. the **historical** Buddha - are known from the so-called Jātakas, stories about his previous **lives.** These describe how he helped other living beings in many ways, sometimes at the cost of his own life. Accordingly, one of the main characteristics of a **Bodhisattva** is that he seeks not just his own liberation, but the liberation of all other **beings** as well.256 At least this is how the Mahāyāna texts describe the difference **between**
Mahāyāna and other Buddhists, and it seems clear that they look down upon the other Buddhists' attempt to reach mere personal liberation as a lower **goal.**
Mahāyāna was not a new sect (nikāya). Monks who chose the **path** to Buddhahood remained members of the same monastic community and **continued** to submit to the same monastic rules.257 On the doctrinal level there were **initially** no points of dispute either. And why should there be? Doctrine and order were not at stake. Strictly speaking, nothing was at stake, for only a personal choice was involved. Undoubtedly, the adepts of Mahāyāna studied the same texts as the **other** Buddhists, and from the point of view of Buddhist doctrine one would **hardly**
expect the birth of Mahāyāna to produce significant changes.258 In reality, events took a different course. Mahāyāna distinguished itself **ever**
more through its own doctrinal developments. In most cases, their starting **points** can be traced to non- or pre-Mahāyāna Buddhism, but their full **development** belongs to Mahāyāna. In these cases one can say that certain tendencies which **also** existed outside and before the birth of Mahāyāna asserted themselves **more** strongly here. Moreover, these new doctrines do not exclusively concern the **main** claims of emergent Mahāyāna such as, for example, the nature of a Buddha **being** different from that of an Arhat. Important developments within Mahāyāna **have** little or nothing to do with these claims. Mahāyāna developed the doctrine in new and unexpected directions, and this happened at a time when the **development** of Buddhist doctrine outside Mahāyāna had for the most part lost its impetus. **This** is all the more astonishing in view of the fact that for a long time the **adepts** of Mahāyāna remained less numerous than the non-Mahāyā**nists.** 
Why should such enthusiastic renewals of Buddhist doctrine take **place**
within this minority movement - renewals which had nothing to do with its **main** aspirations? 

It may be impossible to give a full answer to this question. One **factor**
probably played a major role. It seems that the adepts of emergent Mahāyāna **were** involved in spiritual practice - perhaps more so than other Buddhists. It is **even** possible that at least some of the Mahāyāna Sūtras were inspired by **meditational**
experiences, or by ideas about such experiences.259 These Buddhists **practised**
certain states of meditation. It is likely that the experiences gained in these **states** - or, more likely: the ideas about the experiences to be gained in these **states** - contributed to their world-view. We shall return to this question while **discussing** specific doctrinal developments which may have been influenced or **even** determined by spiritual **practice.**
We will summarise the Mahāyānist path to liberation first. This path is not always clearly depicted in the oldest Mahāyāna texts, but when it is, it often **takes** the following shape. When somebody has taken the resolve called **"mind** of enlightenment" (*bodhicitta*), and has thus become a Bodhisattva, it is his **duty** to cultivate, one after the other, a long series of qualities and practices. **Prominent**
among these are the thirty-seven Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment (bodhipakṣ**ya /** 
bodhipākṣ*ika dharma*), i.e., the Four Applications of **Mindfulness**
(smṛ*tyupasth*āna), the Four Right Exertions (samyakpradhāna or -*prah*āṇa), the Four Constituent Parts of Supernatural Power (ṛ*ddhip*āda), the Five **Faculties** (*indriya*), the Five Strengths (*bala*), the Seven Helpful Means to **Enlightenment**
(*bodhya*ṅga), and the Noble Eightfold Path (ā**rya a**ṣṭāṅga mārga).260 **Sometimes,**
the Four Unmeasurables (*apram*āṇa) - benevolence (*maitr*ī), compassion (*karu*ṇā),
sympathy in joy (*mudit*ā) and equanimity (*upek*ṣā) - are emphasised.261 We **know**
that this enumeration of qualities and practices was looked upon as a list of the most essential points of Buddhist doctrine and practice long before the **birth** of Mahāyāna. It is a concise representation of the path to Arhatship. Thus the Bodhisattva follows the same path as the Arhat up to a certain point. And if we can believe an old text, he even runs the risk of unwittingly becoming one.262 In **order**
to avoid this, he fulfils (paripū*rayati*) the Dharmas Helpful to **Enlightenment,**
without realising (sākṣā*tkaroti*) them.263 The Mahāyānist Bodhisattva aspires for more than mere Arhatship. His **path**
to complete enlightenment, to Buddhahood, is therefore longer and **more** complicated than the path leading to Arhatship. It consists of more than the thirtyseven Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment. A Bodhisattva should also cultivate the so-called perfections (pā*ramit*ā).264 Initially there were six of these, namely the perfection of giving (dāna), of moral conduct (śīla), of patience (kṣānti), of **energy**
(vīrya), of meditation (dhyāna), and of wisdom (*prajñ*ā).265 Four **additional**
perfections were added subsequently. Most of these perfections are **primarily** connected with the mode of life of the adepts of Mahāyāna, but the last one, the perfection of wisdom, has a direct connection with the doctrine. This **perfection** of wisdom was held in high esteem, especially in the so-called Prajñāpāramitā Sū**tras,** "Discourses concerning the perfection of wisdom". Rā**hulabhadra's**
Prajñāpāramitā*stotra*, for instance, calls it the only way to liberation. The Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpā*ramit*ā "Perfection of wisdom in eight thousand **verses",**
which is perhaps the oldest Mahāyāna Sūtra,266 describes it as the leader of the **five**
(remaining) perfections. These five perfections are subsumed in the **perfection** of wisdom. Other texts express similar views.267 What is this perfection of wisdom? The question is discussed in **many**
Mahāyāna texts, particularly in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras. These texts **emphasise** the fact that the phenomenal world does not really exist. This belief is not new in Buddhism. We have already noted how strongly it had marked **Abhidharma**
Buddhism, which, however, did not so much stress the *unreality* of the **phenomenal**
world as the *reality* of the dharmas, which were discussed in much **detail.**
Nevertheless, the Sarvāstivādins already called themselves śūnyavādin - **i.e.,**
"adepts of the doctrine of emptiness" - in the old Vijñānakāya; here it means **that**
they did not recognise the existence of the person.268 We know that they **went**
further and concluded from the non-existence of the person that no **composite**
objects really exist. It is therefore understandable that the **Vibh**āṣā - **another**
Sarvāstivāda text - declares that only the principle according to which all **things**
are empty and without self can be recognised as the highest truth.269 The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras do not hesitate to place this unreality of the **phenomenal** world in the foreground, and to emphasise its absurdity. For if the **phenomenal** world does not really exist, the Buddha does not really exist either, nor do the Bodhisattvas. The following passage from the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpā*ramit*ā illustrates **this:**
The lord said to the Venerable Subhūti, the Elder: Make it clear **now,** Subhūti, to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, starting from perfect **wisdom,** how the Bodhisattvas, the great beings go forth into perfect **wisdom!** [...] Whereupon the Venerable Subhūti, by the Buddha's might, said to the **Lord:** The Lord has said, "make it clear now, Subhūti, to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, starting from perfect wisdom, how the Bodhisattvas, the **great**
beings go forth into perfect wisdom!" When one speaks of a **"Bodhisattva",** what dharma does that word "Bodhisattva" denote? I do not, O Lord, see that dharma "Bodhisattva", nor a dharma called "perfect wisdom". **Since** I neither find, nor apprehend, nor see a dharma "Bodhisattva", nor a **"perfect** wisdom", what Bodhisattva shall I instruct and admonish in what **perfect** wisdom? And yet, O Lord, if, when this is pointed out, a Bodhisattva's **heart** does not become cowed, nor stolid, does not despair nor despond, if he **does** not turn away or become dejected, does not tremble, is not **frightened** or terrified, it is just this Bodhisattva, this great being who should be **instructed** in perfect wisdom. It is precisely this that should be recognized as the perfect wisdom of that Bodhisattva, as his instruction in perfect **wisdom.**
When he thus stands firm, that is his instruction and admonition.270 Later in the same chapter, the following words are attributed to the **Buddha:**
The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, the great being, thinks thus: **countless**
beings I should lead to Nirvāṇa and yet there are none who lead to **Nirvana,**
or who should be led to it. However many beings he may lead to **Nirvana,** yet there is not any being that has been led to Nirvāṇa, nor that has led others to it. For such is the true nature of dharmas, seeing that their **nature** is illusory. Just as if, Subhūti, a clever magician, or magician's **apprentice,** were to conjure up at the cross roads a great crowd of people, and **then** make them vanish again. What do you think, Subhūti, has there anyone **been** killed by anyone, or murdered, or destroyed, or made to **vanish?**
Subhūti: No, indeed, **Lord.** The Lord: Even so a Bodhisattva, a great being, leads countless **beings** to Nirvāṇa, and yet there is not any being that has been led to Nirvāṇa, nor **that**
has led others to it.271 There are many similar passages. Here we should notice the comparison **with** magic, which occurs in many texts. The phenomenal world is not **essentially** different from a magic show. Only the highest knowledge is free from it. It is hardly surprising that the Mahāyāna texts often attribute great magic powers to the advanced Bodhisattvas. Being themselves free from everyday illusions, they can modify at will the unreal delusion to which other beings are continually **subject.** This is, of course, connected with the supernatural powers which those **advanced** on the path of liberation already cultivated before the rise of Mahāyāna, and **which** are called, for example, the Four Constituent Parts of Supernatural **Power**
(ṛ*ddhip*āda) that are part of the Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment (bodhipakṣ*ya /* bodhipākṣ*ika dharma*). In Mahāyāna these supernatural powers blend **more**
smoothly with the overall picture of reality than had been the case before.272 **They** play an especially important role in later times, in Tantric forms of Buddhism.273 Mahāyāna went further than simply denying the reality of the **phenomenal**
world. The next step was to deny the reality of the dharmas.274 We should not underestimate the importance of this step, on the basis of two reflections. First, the dharma theory had practically become identical with Buddhist doctrine.275 The negation of its absolute truth was a rupture of the highest **significance.** Furthermore, the negation of the reality of the dharmas fundamentally modified the Buddhist world-view. The dharma theory enumerates what really exists, and explains how the dharmas constitute our phenomenal world. If the **dharmas** themselves no longer exist, nothing is left. We will examine the **consequences** of this revolutionary change below. First we must deal with the question of how it could take place at **all.**
The sheer delight with which the authors of the Prajñāpāramitā Sū**tras**
appear to emphasise the unreal nature of many things, among them Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, must have made it very tempting for them to take one further **step,** i.e., towards the unreal nature of the dharmas. However, these authors **were** Buddhists, and would therefore have hesitated to reject the central **doctrine** of Buddhism without support from the old canonical texts. And indeed, they **found**
such ancient canonical support.276 In order to understand it, we must briefly **deal**
with a linguistic problem in Middle **Indic.**
We have already dealt with the doctrine of non-self in Buddhism. We **have**
seen that the Buddha rejected the idea that one can reach liberation **through** knowledge of the self. The concept of the self that he referred was hardly **different** from the one current among certain non-Buddhists. This self was eternal, **blissful,** not subject to change. This concept was soon succeeded by another one, which **sees**
the person as the totality of all its component parts. The negation of *this* self was closely connected with the view that composite objects do not **exist.**
The development of the Buddhist doctrine of the non-self did not end **here.**
In order to understand its subsequent development, we have to remember that the oldest Buddhist tradition did not use Sanskrit, but a Middle Indic language **which**
has not survived.277 It was different from the other Indian languages in which the old Canon is now extant, i.e. mainly (Buddhist) Sanskrit and Pāli.278 Pāli, **too,** is a Middle Indic language, which differs from Sanskrit on a point that is important for this **discussion.**
Consider some canonical statements which concern the doctrine of the nonself. It is often stated that all the dharmas, or other things, are not the self.279 In all of these statements, the Pāli uses the singular substantive *anatt*ā 'non-self', **which** belongs to the n-stem *attan* 'self'. But in Pāli, as in other old Middle **Indic**
languages, the n-stems often change under the influence of a-stems.280 This **means**
that *anatt*ā can also be the plural of *anatta*, rather than the singular of *anattan*. In this case, *anatt*ā is a plural adjective meaning 'without self'. In Sanskrit **this**
confusion is impossible: the singular substantive is anātmā, the plural **adjective** anātmāna˙. 

Fortunately, the Pāli canon contains many passages which **allow** us to ascertain that *anatt*ā is a singular substantive, meaning 'non-self'.281 Buddhist **texts**
in Sanskrit likewise confirm this interpretation.282 Nevertheless, certain **variant**
readings suggest that the alternative interpretation was found attractive **already** at an early date. Sometimes, the Pāli commentaries interpret *anatt*ā to mean **'without**
self'.283 In other places, we find a modified reading for *anatt*ā which only **allows**
for the interpretation 'without self'.284 Certain sanskritisations also show that *anatt*ā
/ anā*tman* was often taken to be an adjective.285 At times, the adjective *anatta* is not used but its meaning is expressed differently; as in the sentence "forms are **empty**
of self, or empty of what belongs to a self".286 This means the same as "forms are without a **self…".** 
This technical discussion allows us to understand how an important **change**
in the Buddhist world-view that took it away from the Buddha's words could **take** place without anyone noticing. For the difference between "the dharmas are not the self" and "the dharmas are without self" is highly significant. The first **sentence** only states that there is no self among the dharmas. Combined with the belief **that** only the dharmas really exist, this justifies the conclusion that no self **exists.** Indeed, the sentence "the dharmas are not the self" does not say anything about the dharmas, but concerns something (the self) which is found - or would be **found** if it existed - outside the dharmas. The sentence "the dharmas are without self", on the other hand, says something about the dharmas. It can be interpreted to mean **that**
the dharmas have no nature of their own, so that they do not really exist.287 **This**
idea soon became popular. The texts mention the "emptiness of the **dharmas"**
(dharmaśū*nyat*ā) or the "lack of self of the dharmas" (dharmanairā*tmya*), to be contrasted with the older "lack of self of the person" (pudgalanairā*tmya*). **More**
precisely, the lack of self of the dharmas was seen as an extension of the **lack** of self of the person. As we have observed in our analysis of the word *anatt*ā, **this**
development appears to have already started in canonical times.288 A few **non-** Mahāyāna Buddhist schools subsequently adopted this idea,289 which **became** important in Mahāyāna.290 The doctrine of the emptiness, or lack of self, of the dharmas cannot be **fully**
explained by a linguistic misunderstanding of the Middle Indic word *anatt*ā. It **fits**
too well into the developments outlined above. The change of interpretation of the word *anatt*ā was therefore very convenient. The linguistic ambiguity helped the development, and gave it a certain direction. But we should not conclude from **this** that without this ambiguity there would have been no further **development** in approximately the same **direction.** 
What hides behind this tendency to deny the reality of the **phenomenal**
world and the dharmas? Its first beginnings can be found in the old **discourses,**
which claim, for instance:291 "Sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, **false,**
deceptive; they are illusory, the prattle of fools." It has been suggested that the doctrine of the illusory nature of appearances was the reflection of a spiritual **state,**
and simultaneously an indicator of how to reach it.292 The corresponding **spiritual**
state would be the Attainment of Cessation of Ideations and **Feelings**
(saṃjñāvedayitanirodhasamā*patti*), also referred to as Attainment of **Cessation**
(nirodhasamā*patti*). We noted earlier that no spiritual processes can take **place** in this state, and that in ancient times the highest enlightenment could therefore not take place in it. But we cannot rule out that the lack of ideations and **sensations** in this state came to be interpreted to mean that ideations and sensations do not correspond to the highest reality. In other words, the world is empty. The Mahāyāna doctrine of the illusory nature of the world could be the **ontological** equivalent of this state, now understood to be the experience of the unreal **nature** of the phenomenal **world.**
There are indeed passages which describe how a Bodhisattva can reach the concentration on emptiness (śūnyatāsamādhi). In this concentration, the **aggregates**
(*skandha*) must be visualised (*pratyavek*ṣ-) as empty.293 Mental activity, **which** is responsible for the phenomenal world, must be abandoned. The aim of **such**
exercises is to "empty" the phenomenal world. A passage of the Kāś*yapaparivarta* is more explicit:294 "Enter into the state of Attainment of the Cessation of **Ideations**
and Feelings! [For] when a monk has entered into the state of Attainment of the Cessation of Ideations and Feelings, he has nothing further left to do." If the **monk** has nothing left to do, he has reached **liberation.**
If it is true that the doctrine of the unreal nature of **appearances** is a reflection of the state of Attainment of Cessation295 - or better: the **reflection** of ideas about this state of attainment296 - then we are allowed to draw **certain**
conclusions. For we have seen that the Attainment of Cessation originally **belonged** to another, non-Buddhist circle of ideas and practices. This state entered **into** Buddhist practice at an early date, but without fundamentally changing the **ideas** about liberating knowledge. In Mahāyāna a further step was taken: even the **content** of the highest liberating knowledge is now determined by the state of **Attainment** of Cessation. Since the latter is empty of ideations and feelings, liberating **knowledge** itself, i.e. the perfection of wisdom, has the emptiness of the phenomenal **world** as its object. Seen this way, the non-Buddhist ideology which the Buddha had **tried** to keep out, had now definitely found its way into Buddhist doctrine and **practice.**
Buddhist texts also link the doctrine of the emptiness of the world with **other**
meditative states. In early Mahāyāna, the spiritual technique of visualising had gained prominence.297 This technique is often linked with the "meditation on the Buddhas" (buddhā*nusm*ṛti), which is already mentioned in the old **discourses.**
Initially, this practice had nothing to do with visualising. This new element **appears**
Buddhism.298 The Pratyutpanna-buddha-saṃmukhāvasthita-samādhi Sūtra
"Discourse on the concentration in which [the yogi is] situated face to face with the Buddhas existing at that time", which is one of the oldest Mahāyāna texts that **have** been preserved, emphasises the fundamentally unreal nature of the **objects** experienced during this concentration and compares them to things **experienced** in a dream. The Sūtra then goes on to explain the emptiness of all the dharmas.299 Unlike the Attainment of Cessation (nirodhasamā*patti*), the **practice** of visualisation is less directly connected with the emptiness of all dharmas. On the basis of visualisation practices, it would likewise be possible to reach the conclusion that the phenomenal world is shaped by the mind, and is **therefore** unreal, and that only the mind really exists. This is indeed stated in a passage of the Pratyutpanna-buddha-saṃmukhāvasthita-samādhi Sūtra which declares: **"This**
[entire world] consisting of the three spheres is mind only (cittamātra)".300 We **shall**
see below that this point of view came to occupy a central place in the **so-called**
Yogācāra.301 The present passage, on the other hand, appears to **interpret**
meditational experiences (or ideas about them) as corroborating the new **doctrine** of emptiness. Seen this way, there is no one-way road between spiritual praxis and doctrine. Certain doctrinal positions were probably inspired by **meditational** experiences (or in the case of the Attainment of Cessation, by the lack of any **such** experiences) - or better, by ideas about such experiences or **non-experiences.** Inversely, certain meditational experiences were interpreted in the light of **these** doctrinal positions. There is in this way a constant interplay between doctrine and spiritual praxis, in which it is impossible to decide in every instance how **exactly** they influenced each **other.** 
We have to be attentive, however. In the context of Indian **religions,** it is customary to claim that the doctrinal positions of this or that school are **based** on the direct perception of reality by certain spiritually advanced beings. In the context of Brahmanism, such beings are mostly the seers of yore (ṛṣi), or **yogis;** in the context of Jainism, it is the Jina. Yogis, for example, are supposed to **perceive** directly the categories and sub-categories of the Brahmanical school of the Vaiśeṣika: among these, one's own and other people's souls, substances **such** as space, direction and time, atoms, wind, the mind, inherence, etc.302 No **modern**
scholar is likely to take these Vaiśeṣika claims seriously.303 Its ideas are not **taken**
from meditative practices. Nevertheless, it looks as if the Vaiśeṣika felt **somehow** obliged to postulate a connection between its own doctrines and **meditative** practices, even though the school had no particular link with **traditions** of meditation.

In Buddhism the situation is completely different. Here meditative **practices**
are constantly discussed and analysed. It is indeed hard to imagine that any new doctrine could have been accepted in Buddhism without it being looked **upon,** implicitly or explicitly, as the object of experience of spiritually advanced **adepts.** Hence it is justified to ask whether the Buddhist assertion that this or that **truth** is perceived during meditation still means anything at all. We have **therefore** to examine whether and to what extent the doctrine of the unreal **nature** of appearances can be understood as continuous developments out of older **forms** of Buddhism. In the old discourses, liberation takes place in the fourth **stage** of meditation (dhyāna); the knowledge which leads to liberation concerns the **Four**
Noble Truths. The same role was also attributed to other types of **knowledge** in ancient Buddhism, especially the knowledge of the non-self or lack of **self.** Mahāyāna Buddhism developed the doctrine of the lack of self, and widened its interpretation so as to include the lack of self of the dharmas. This **reinterpreted** lack of self is the emptiness of the world, knowledge of which leads to the perfection of wisdom. Thus it turns out that this perfection of wisdom is not a **break** with the past, but rather the partial reinterpretation and extension of an **element**
which already existed before Mahāyāna Buddhism.304 The phenomenal world and the dharmas, then, are without reality. But is **there** passages in the Prajñāpāramitā literature seem to evoke this possibility. **Erich** Frauwallner summarises their content as **follows:** 
The idea of a highest existence is central [...]. In conformity with the **general** development of Buddhism, the texts sharply emphasise the ungraspable and indeterminable nature of this highest existence. Only rarely is it **described** as a spotless and luminous mind (prabhāsvaraṃ *cittam*), following an old **idea**
found here and there in the Canon, later taken over by the Mahāsāṃ**ghikas.** Generally, it is stated again and again that no determinations apply to it. It is without origin and end, uncreated and unchanging, and has not **entered** existence at all. It is unthinkable, imponderable, immeasurable, **uncountable** and without equal. It is limitless, i.e., without beginning, middle or end, and thus spatially unlimited. It is also temporally without beginning, **without** present, and without end, and thus it lies outside the three time **zones.** In short, it is naturally pure and free from all determinations. It is as a **result**
also unimaginable (*avikalpa*) and no cognitive processes can take place in it.

Due to its unlimited and ungraspable nature, it is frequently **likened** to empty **space.**
As a further consequence of this, it is not touched by what happens in the phenomenal world. It is neither bound nor released, neither stained nor purified, and it exercises no influence itself. Whether recognised or **not,** it remains unmoved. It does not thrive when it is taught, nor does it **decline** when it is not **taught.** 
As a designation of the highest existence, we often find the **expression**
"essence of the dharmas" (**dharm**āṇāṃ *dharmat*ā) and "element of the dharmas" (*dharmadh*ātu), further "culminating point of the real" (bhū*tako*ṭi).

More characteristic and equally favoured is its designation as **thusness**
(*tathat*ā), which can already be found in the canonical writings. This **name**
seems to express the ungraspable nature of highest existence, which is **only** similar to itself. In later times, it was thought to express its **unchangable** nature. Even more typical, though less common, are its **designations** as emptiness (śū*nyat*ā), as without characteristics (ā*nimitta*) and as **undesired**
(apraṇ*ihita*), expressions which were already used in the Hīnayāna but **with**
a different meaning. For these expressions strongly emphasise the undefinable nature of the highest existence, and their importance is **further** heightened by the fact that they - and their contemplation - are called the gates to liberation (vimokṣ*amukha*).

As the essence of all things, this highest existence is also the essence of the Buddha (tathā*gatatva*), it is omniscience (*sarvajñat*ā) and the **perfection** of wisdom (prajñāpā*ramit*ā).305 It is clear from this passage that the texts create the impression that they **recognise** a highest existence. However, at least for some of them, this impression is **wrong.** The highest truth is that there is no highest existence. The following **passage** illustrates **this:**
Subhūti: Even Nirvāṇa, I say, is like a magical illusion, is like a dream. How much more so anything else? … Even if perchance there could be **anything** more distinguished, of that too I would say that it is like an illusion, **like** a dream.306 The old Mahāyāna texts confront us in this way with a contradiction. In reality, the contradiction is only apparent. The example of eternity makes this clear.307 We know that according to early Mahāyāna the phenomenal world and the dharmas are empty, i.e., without highest reality: because they do not really exist, they **cannot** be produced and cannot disappear. In this sense, they are without beginning and without end. The same holds for the so-called highest existence. It is also **ultimately** unreal, and has no beginning and no end. This is stated in the following **passage**
with reference to the perfections:308 "The perfection of wisdom (prajñāpā*ramit*ā)
has not perished, does not perish, will not perish; and thus the **perfection** of meditation (dhyānapā*ramit*ā), energy (vīryapā*ramit*ā), patience (kṣāntipā*ramit*ā),
morality (śīlapā*ramit*ā), and generosity (dānapā*ramit*ā) has not perished, does not perish, will not perish; that is because there is no birth of those dharmas, and **what**
has no birth, how can that be known to undergo perishing?" And the Aṣṭasā*hasrik*ā Prajñāpā*ramit*ā declares:309 "The perfection of wisdom is immeasurable, **eternal,**
without end. Why? Because the perfection of wisdom does not exist." The **passage**
then goes on to make a comparison with space (ākāśa): just as the latter has no measure, no duration, no end, similarly the perfection of wisdom has no **measure,** no duration, and no **end.** 
In this representation there can ultimately be no difference between socalled highest existence on the one hand, and the phenomenal world and the dharmas on the other. Both are unreal and therefore without beginning or end. The following passage from the thirteenth chapter of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpā*ramit*ā shows this by putting the highest existence and the phenomenal world beside **each** other on one and the same **level:**
Subhūti: Deep, O Lord, is perfect wisdom. Certainly as a great enterprise has this perfection of wisdom been set up, as an unthinkable, **incomparable,** immeasurable, incalculable enterprise, as an enterprise which equals the unequalled.

The Lord: So it is, Subhūti. And why is it an unthinkable **enterprise?**
Because unthinkable are Tathāgatahood, Buddhahood, **Self-existence**
(svayaṃbhūtva), and omniscience (*sarvajñatva*). And on these one **cannot**
reflect with one's thought, since they cannot be an object of **thought,** or of volition, or of any of the dharmas which constitute thought. And why is it an incomparable enterprise? Because one cannot reflect on Tathāgatahood, **etc.,** nor compare it. And why is it immeasurable? Because Tathāgatahood, **etc.,** is immeasurable. And why is it incalculable? Because Tathāgatahood, **etc.,** is incalculable. And why is it an enterprise which equals the **unequalled?** Because nothing can be equal to the Tathāgata, to the fully Enlightened **One,** to the Self-existent, to the Omniscient, how much less can **anything** be superior to **him?**
Subhuti: Do these five attributes apply only to Tathāgatahood, etc., or **also** to the aggregates (*skandha*), and to all **dharmas?**
The Lord: They apply to them also. Also the aggregates, and also all dharmas are unthinkable. For with regard to the true essential **nature** of form, etc., there is no thought, nor volition, nor any of the dharmas **which** constitute thought, nor any comparing. For that reason the aggregates and all dharmas are also unthinkable and incomparable. They are **also** immeasurable, because one cannot conceive of a measure of form, etc. **since** such a measure does not exist, in consequence of the infinitude of all dharmas. They are also incalculable, because they have risen above all possibility of counting. They are also equal to the unequalled, because all dharmas are the same as space.310 This passage mentions the Five Aggregates (form, sensation, ideation, **conditioned** factors, consciousness), as well as all the dharmas in general, in the same **breath** as the essence of the perfected one, Buddhahood, existence of the self, and omniscience. In other words, the text does not differentiate between the phenomenal world (embodied in the dharmas) and the so-called highest **existence.** This highest existence is described in the same terms as the phenomenal world and the dharmas because neither of them really exists. Both are without origin and without end because they ultimately do not exist; and that which does not exist can We may yet wonder whether these authors - who repeadedly discuss the essence of the dharmas (**dharm**āṇāṃ *dharmat*ā), the element of the **dharmas**
(*dharmadh*ātu), the culminating point of the real (bhū*tako*ṭi), thusness (*tathat*ā),
emptiness (śū*nyat*ā), the essence of the Buddha (tathā*gatatva*), **omniscience**
(*sarvajñat*ā), and the perfection of wisdom (prajñāpā*ramit*ā) - really rejected the idea of a highest existence. This plethora of designations only made sense if **their** users had some idea of what they represented. One cannot but think of the comparison with space (ākāśa), which is often used in the texts. Space is **presented**
as being nothing at all, and therefore without measure, duration or end. But in India, space is not only looked upon as being nothing at all. Since ancient **times,** a more positive concept of space has also been known. In the older **Upanishads,**
space is an element that is sometimes identified with the highest Brahman.311 Within Buddhism, the Sarvāstivādins considered space a **non-conditioned**
(asaṃskṛta) dharma, as we have seen. We have also seen that the Sautrā**ntikas**
rejected this; for them, space is pure absence, and therefore nothing at all. The authors of the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras were no doubt aware that it was **possible** to interpret the example of space positively.312 It looks as if they were playing **with**
ideas which in the end they rejected. They discussed something very **similar** to a highest existence, but in the end they returned to the position that this **highest** existence is also empty and therefore **unreal.** 
Whatever the case may be, further developments within Mahāyāna **show** a great need for a highest reality. Increasingly, the expressions enumerated **above** tended to be interpreted positively, but the ambiguity between highest **existence** and nothingness was not abandoned. We shall examine some of these **developments** below. First we deal with Madhyamaka, a development which - as we shall see - links the tradition of the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras with Sarvāstivāda **rationality.** Madhyamaka The early Mahāyāna Sūtras seem to react against the Abhidharma **Buddhists'** overall attempts at systematisation. However, they did not as a rule attack **isolated** doctrinal positions adopted by the Sarvāstivādins. This would not have **been** possible without examining these ideas in depth and dealing with them **rationally.** Such rational discussions were not sought by the adepts of early Mahāyāna. **They** preferred to dedicate themselves to religious practice rather than **hair-splitting** discussions. 

There was however one Mahāyāna adept who answered the Sarvāstivā**dins'**
challenge on their own terms.313 This was Nāgārjuna, who probably lived during the second century CE.314 Using the utmost skill and virtuosity, Nāgārjuna turned the Sārvāstivādins' own rationality against them. His major work is the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā "the Foundational Verses of the Middle **Teaching",**
probably not yet called thus by Nāgārjuna himself. We know that the **Buddha's** path to liberation was called "middle path" already in the old discourses. Nāgā**rjuna**
borrows the idea, but reinterprets it in his own way.315 As the name of a **school,** Madhyamaka or Mādhyamika is only attested later.316 The *Foundational Verses of the Middle Teaching* are not merely an **attack** on Sarvāstivāda doctrine. The method which they develop goes much farther, and no doubt at times it made even non-Sarvāstivādins shake their heads in **wonder.** Nāgārjuna did not merely assert that the phenomenal world does not exist, but he actually managed to prove it. Nāgārjuna thus belongs to those thinkers, of **whom** there are also examples in ancient Greece and China, who put the new **instrument**
of logic to this use.317 We must remember, however, that most **Buddhists** of Nāgārjuna's time were a priori convinced of the outcome of his arguments that the effect of Nāgārjuna's method was to prove that their conception of the world, **i.e.,** their dharma theory, could not be correct **either.**
A proof that shows that the phenomenal world does not exist should **interest**
everyone who is interested in philosophy, even non-Buddhists, and indeed, **these** latter were not slow to react. We shall however concentrate on some of the arguments which mainly concern Abhidharma Buddhism. We shall soon **discover** that even when Nāgārjuna attacks doctrines which are specific to these **Buddhists,** the scope of his argumentation goes well beyond these **doctrines.**
In order to grasp many of Nāgārjuna's arguments, we must note the following. Nāgārjuna's starting point, which he shared with most Buddhists of his time, was the conviction that the objects of the phenomenal world are **somehow** conditioned by words. We have already discussed this understanding of the **relation** between words and things while dealing with the arrangement of the doctrine in the early centuries following the Buddha's demise. This belief was the **common** property of most Buddhists at that time. Nāgārjuna did not feel **compelled** to go against it. On the contrary, his new method consisted in using this belief - or **better,** this conviction - in a new fashion. In so doing, however, he did not, like **most** Buddhists before him, limit its scope to isolated words: he also took **propositions** into consideration. His premise was that the words which occur in a **proposition** each correspond to an object or event in the situation described by it. As a **matter** of fact, this is often the case. For instance, the proposition "Nāgārjuna reads a **book"** describes a situation in which there is a book, Nāgārjuna, and the **activity** of reading. But there are other propositions in which such a direct connection with the phenomenal world is difficult to maintain. An example is the **proposition** "Nāgārjuna writes a book". This proposition describes a situation in **which** Nāgārjuna and the activity of writing have their place. But the book is not yet **there;** it will be there when the writing is over. Faced with this difficulty, one **might** conclude that the hypothesis according to which the words in a **proposition** correspond to objects or events in the situation described is not correct. For Nāgārjuna, this conclusion was unimaginable. For him, difficulties like this **were** merely proof that the phenomenal world does not really exist. Like other Buddhists, he knew this beforehand. Contradictions of this kind only showed that the **unreality**
of the phenomenal world could now also be proved.318 We now turn to some passages from the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā which **deal**
with Sarvāstivāda doctrinal positions in particular. As we said before, the Kārikās' arguments are not exclusively aimed at the Sarvāstivādins; they have a wider **scope.** However, here and there Nāgārjuna takes Sarvāstivāda doctrinal positions as the starting-point of his **argumentations.**
We start with the seventh chapter, which deals with the **"characteristics** of the conditioned" (saṃskṛ*talak*ṣaṇa). These are Conditioned Factors Separated **from**
the Mind (*cittaviprayukta sa*ṃskāra), viz., birth (jāti), old age (jarā), **existence**
(*sthiti*) and impermanence (*anityat*ā), which we have discussed in a **previous**
chapter. Their number varies: sometimes there are four of them, sometimes **three.** Nāgārjuna knows only three of them, with old age left out. Instead of the expressions birth (jāti), existence (*sthiti*), and impermanence (*anityat*ā), he **uses**
origination (utpāda), existence (*sthiti*) and destruction (bhaṅga) respectively. The role of these dharmas remains the same: they are responsible for the **origination,** existence and disappearance of each conditioned dharma. Nāgārjuna **says:**
If there is a characteristic of the conditioned other than origination (utpāda),
existence (*sthiti*), and destruction (bhaṅga), there would be infinite **regress** (*anavasth*ā). If there is no such [characteristic], these are not **conditioned** (na saṃskṛta). (7.3)319 This concerns a problem which we have met before. **Conditioned** (saṃskṛta)
dharmas need a dharma called birth (jāti), or origination (utpāda), in order to **come** into being. But the dharma "birth" is itself conditioned (saṃskṛta), and **therefore**
needs such a dharma itself, which could then be called "origination of **origination"**
(utpā*dotp*āda). This origination of origination, however, too is a **conditioned**
dharma, and would therefore need a further dharma called "origination". **This**
series has no end, and this is what Nāgārjuna calls infinite regress (*anavasth*ā).

We have already seen how the Sarvāstivādins sought to solve this **problem:**
the primary origination brings about the origination of origination, and the origination of origination brings about the primary origination. These are the **exact** words which Nāgārjuna puts in the mouth of his **opponent:** 
The origination of origination is exclusively the origination of **primary** origination. Again, the primary origination produces the **origination** of origination. **(7.4)**
Here Nāgārjuna points out how problematic mutual causes **are:**
If the origination of origination is for you the origination of the **primary** origination, not being produced by the primary [origination], how can the [former] produce the [latter]? **(7.5)** If, produced by the primary [origination], it produces the **primary** [origination], how can that primary [origination], not being produced by it, produce it? **(7.6)**
In other words, something has first to be produced itself in order to **produce** something else. The next verse elaborates **this:**
This, while being produced, may, if you so desire, produce that, if **this,**
[though as yet] unborn (ajāta), can produce that. **(7.7)**
Here Nāgārjuna attributes to his opponent the following **explanation:**
As a light will illuminate itself as well as other things, so does **origination** produce both itself and other things. **(7.8)**
Nāgārjuna submits this example of a light to the following destructive **analysis:**
There exists no darkness either in the light or in whatever place it is **situated.** What does light illuminate? For illumination is the destruction of **darkness.** (7.9) How can darkness be destroyed by light that is arising, when the light **that** is arising does not reach the darkness? **(7.10)** On the other hand, if darkness is destroyed by light that has not reached it, then that [light], while remaining here, will destroy the darkness **present** in all the worlds. **(7.11)** If light illuminates both itself and other things, then certainly darkness too will conceal itself and other things. (7.12)
Nāgārjuna then returns to the dharma "origination" (utpāda):
How can this non-arisen origination (utpāda) produce itself? If it **produces**
having arisen, then, it having been born, what is it that is produced **again?**
(7.13) Neither that which is presently arising, nor what has arisen, nor what has not arisen, arises in any way. This has already been explained by means of **[the** road] being traveled, [the road] traveled and [the road] not traveled. **(7.14)**
In this last verse, Nāgārjuna refers to an argument which he had **exposed** in an earlier chapter. This is indeed one of his favourite arguments. It frequently **recurs** in his verses. We will discuss it **below.**
A central element in Nāgārjuna's reasoning is tersely expressed in verse 17: 
If something that has not arisen exists somewhere, it could arise. **Since** no such thing exists, what **arises?**
Nāgārjuna then submits the two remaining characteristics of the **conditioned** to a similar and equally destructive analysis. He concludes the chapter with the following two **verses:**
Since origination, duration and destruction are not established, the conditioned (saṃskṛta) does not exist. Given that the conditioned is not established, how will the non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) be established? **(7.33)**
Origination, endurance and destruction have been declared to be **like** an illusion, like a dream, like a city of the *gandharvas*. **(7.34)**
This conclusion clearly shows what remains of Sārvāstivāda ontology in the **hands** of Nāgārjuna. Not only do the three (or four) dharmas known as the **characteristics** of the conditioned turn out to be unprovable or even non-existent. All the conditioned (saṃskṛta) and non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) dharmas undergo the **same**
fate. But for the Sarvāstivādins, the conditioned and non-conditioned dharmas are the only things which really exist. Without an answer to Nāgārjuna's attack, **their** whole ontology breaks **down.**
In order to understand Nāgārjuna's method of analysis better, let us **look**
more closely at verse 17. Here Nāgārjuna **declares:** 
If something that has not arisen exists somewhere, it could arise. **Since** no such thing exists, what arises?

The problem becomes clearer once we apply this question to a concrete **example.** In the proposition "the pot comes into existence", the question arises: how can the pot come into existence if it isn't there? The pot must exist in order to accomplish any kind of activity. In the present case, the activity is that of coming into **existence.** Therefore, the pot must exist in order to come into existence. But if it **already** exists, it no longer needs to come into existence, because it is already **there.**
As we have noticed earlier, Nāgārjuna bases himself on **propositions** in order to draw conclusions about the phenomenal world. This can lead to **impossible** and contradictory situations. These problematic propositions show that the phenomenal world does not really exist. For Nāgārjuna, being a **Buddhist,** it probably went without saying that the analysis of the phenomenal world and the analysis of verbal propositions should come to the same. For language and the phenomenal world correspond to each other, this because the phenomenal **world** is conditioned by language. The proposition "the pot comes into existence" **must** therefore correspond to a situation in the phenomenal world in which the pot and the activity of coming into existence coexist. Since this is impossible - if **there** is already a pot, it no longer needs to come into existence - this analysis **demonstrates** what the Buddhists had known all along, namely, that the phenomenal world has no absolute **reality.** 
Nāgārjuna pushes this method of argumentation further, and in **doing** so does not spare the Abhidharma Buddhists. He shows that their explanation of the phenomenal world, too, is untenable. The existence of dharmas is no **more** defendable than that of pots and similar **things.** 
In the above translated verse 7.14, Nāgārjuna refers to an argument **which**
concerns the paths which are presently being traveled, those which have **been** traveled, and those which have not been traveled. This argument is explained in the second chapter of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, and leads to the conclusion **that**
traveling, the traveler and the path which is being traveled, do not exist (2.25).320 Consider the following **verses:**
If there were a traveling of [a road] that is being traveled, there **would** be two [acts of] traveling: the [traveling] by which that [road] is being **traveled,**
and again that traveling on it. **(2.5)**
If there were two [acts of] traveling, there would be two travelers. For **there** can be no traveling without a traveler. **(2.6)**
We shall not examine Nāgārjuna's subsequent verses. These two are **enough** to show that here, too, Nāgārjuna bases himself on a verbal expression, namely: **"The** road presently being traveled is being traveled." In this proposition, the verb "to travel" is used twice, and this is enough for Nāgārjuna to conclude that there **must** be two acts of traveling. As in the proposition "the pot comes into existence", **here** too, Nāgārjuna does not distinguish between language and the phenomenal **world.** 
It appears that for Nāgārjuna the case of the road which is being **traveled**
served as an example for others. He refers to it in the discussion of the characteristics of the conditioned, as we have seen. He does the same elsewhere, for example in the third chapter where he discusses the Buddhist **doctrine** of perception, which, too, is shown to be untenable. Here we turn to the first **chapter**
of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, which deals with the Abhidharma **Buddhists'**
doctrine of causality. We have noted above that this doctrine is an important **part** of the dharma theory. For it is causality which connects the momentary dharmas **that** are produced one after the other, and which conditions their production. The Sarvāstivādins had made a distinction between different sorts of **conditions**
(*pratyaya*): the producing condition (*hetu-pratyaya*); the support (ā*ramba*ṇa- or ā*lambana-pratyaya*) or object of knowledge; the immediately contiguous **condition**
(*samanantara-pratyaya*); and the determining condition (*adhipati-pratyaya*). **They**
are mentioned in the second **verse:**
There are four conditions (*pratyaya*), namely, the producing **condition** (*hetu*), the support (ā*ramba*ṇa), the immediately contiguous **condition**
(*anantara*), and the determining condition (ā*dhipateya*). A fifth **condition**
does not exist. (1.2)321 Nāgārjuna then proceeds to demolish the idea of cause and **effect:** 
Activity is not constituted of conditions (*pratyaya*) nor is it not **constituted** of conditions. Conditions are neither constituted nor not constituted of **activity.** (1.4) These are conditions, because depending upon them these [others] **arise.** So long as these [others] do not arise, why are they not non-conditions? **(1.5)** A condition of something that is non-existent or of something that is **existent** is not proper. What non-existent [thing] has a condition? Of what use is the condition of an existent [thing]? **(1.6)**
Since a thing that is existent or non-existent or both existent and nonexistent does not produce, how could there be, such being the **case,** a producing condition? **(1.7)**
It is easy to show that Nāgārjuna's logic, here as well as in the examples **discussed**
above, is mostly false.322 This observation, though correct, does not do **sufficient**
justice to Nāgārjuna's presuppositions. For him - as we have already noted **above** - language plays a decisive role in interpreting the phenomenal world. Language **says** that a cause needs an effect, and vice versa. However, cause and effect do not **exist** at the same time. When a cause exists, its effect does not exist. And once the **effect** is there, its cause often exists no longer. How then can they be dependent on **each** other? In order to convince Nāgārjuna that his conclusions are false, one should not teach him a better logic, but a different world-view.323 Given his **presuppositions,**
most of his arguments are faultless from a logical point of **view.**
After this overall criticism, it is easy for Nāgārjuna to prove in the **verses**
that follow that the four types of conditions mentioned above are untenable. **Here** again, he reaches the conclusion that coming into being is not really **possible.** 
In the first verses of the nineteenth chapter, Nāgārjuna uses the same **type** of argument to prove that time does not **exist:**
If the present and the future depend upon the past, then the present and the future will be in the past time. **(19.1)** Again, if the present and the future do not exist therein [i.e., in the **past],** how could the present and the future depend upon it? **(19.2)** Moreover, non-dependent upon the past, the [present and future] **cannot** be established. Therefore, neither the present nor the future time exist. (19.3)324 In the fifteenth chapter, Nāgārjuna deals with another notion we have met before, namely, the Sarvāstivādins' concept of the dharmas' "own **nature"**
(*svabh*āva). This is supposed to be eternal and beyond the scope of time. **According**
to Nāgārjuna, such an "own nature" stands in contradiction with **causal** dependence. He **states:**
The occurrence of the own nature through causes and conditions is not proper. An own nature that has occurred as a result of causes and **conditions** would be something that is made. **(15.1)** Again, how could there be an own nature that is made? Indeed, an **unmade** own nature is independent of something else. **(15.2)**
In the absence of an own nature (*svabh*āva), whence can there be **another**
nature (*parabh*āva)? For the own nature of another nature is called **another**
nature. **(15.3)** How can there be something that is without own nature and other **nature?** For something is established only when there is own nature and other **nature.** (15.4) When something is not established, [its] absence is also not established. It is, indeed, the change of something that people generally call its **absence.**
(15.5)325 While reading this passage, it is important to keep in mind that only that **which** "exists" in the highest sense of the term can be or have an own nature. We **have** already seen that whatever has originated from causes or conditions does not **really** exist. It is therefore not surprising to see that Nāgārjuna starts from the premise **that**
if things were to possess an own nature, they would have to be without origin.326 We have already touched upon Nāgārjuna's position on causality, but without mentioning the doctrine of Conditioned Origination. This doctrine is of the highest interest to him. For Nāgārjuna, it is proof that the dharmas cannot **really** exist. For this doctrine connects the dharmas with each other, and shows **their** mutual dependence. We have seen that for Nāgārjuna dependence **implies** simultaneity. However, the dharmas arise one after the other, and this gives **rise** to a contradiction from which Nāgārjuna concludes that all the dharmas are **empty,** i.e., without real **existence:**
We state that Conditioned Origination is emptiness. It is mere **designation** depending on something, and it is the middle path. **(24.18)** Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is **nothing**
that is not empty. (24.19)327 For Nāgārjuna, Conditioned Origination is emptiness, just as for the Sarvāstivā**dins,** Conditioned Origination was the conditioned dharmas. Since for Nāgārjuna **there** are no dharmas (because the dharmas are empty), Conditioned Origination is **also** empty, or, as he says here, emptiness. For Nāgārjuna, therefore, neither the **objects** or events of the phenomenal world nor the dharmas exist in highest **reality.** Ultimately, for him, nothing exists at all. This knowledge constitutes the **middle** way, as verse 18 appears to **state.** To conclude, we shall examine Nāgārjuna's treatment of the problem of the **self.** We know what important role this problem had played in the history of **Buddhism** before his time. The relevant canonical passages had been interpreted in **various** ways. Originally, their aim appears to have been to reject a concept of the **self** similar to the one found in the old Upanishads, and the liberating knowledge **which** was associated with it. But soon, knowledge of the non-self became **liberating** knowledge in its own right. Besides, these passages started to be **seen** as confirmations of the idea that composite things do not really exist. Finally, **certain** Buddhists saw in these very passages proof that the dharmas do not really **exist.** It is interesting to see how Nāgārjuna dealt with this **problem.** 
We meet most of these ideas in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā. For Nāgā**rjuna,**
the dharmas are empty and do not really exist. We shall soon see that for him, **too,** knowledge of the non-self plays a decisive role in reaching liberation. He is **also** of the opinion that composite things do not really **exist.** 
This last idea is closely connected with the Buddhist concept of the **person**
as a collection of dharmas. This concept belonged to the Pudgalavādins, who accepted it, but was also known to those Buddhists who denied the **existence** of a person: these Buddhists rejected precisely this concept. The Pudgalavāda, we saw earlier, was a movement within Buddhism which sought, in a limited **way,** to ascertain the reality of the phenomenal world. The Pudgalavādins maintained **that** the person really exists and is no mere illusion. In a certain sense, the Pudgalavādins and Nāgārjuna, who brought the negation of the phenomenal **world** to new heights, are complete opposites. Contrary to the Pudgalavādins, Nāgā**rjuna's** highest reality is empty. This does not change the fact that his phenomenal **world** contains many things, including persons and composite objects. We should not be surprised to see that Nāgārjuna, while discussing the person, starts from **premises** that resemble those of the Pudgalavādins. Indeed, Nāgārjuna's discussion of the person immediately turns to the relationship between the person and the **aggregates**
(*skandha*):
If the self were to be identical with the aggregates, it would arise and **cease.** If it were different from the aggregates, it would not have the **characteristics** of the aggregates. **(18.1)** In the absence of a self, how can there be something that belongs to the **self?** From the appeasement of the self and of what belongs to the self, one is **free** from "mine" and "I". **(18.2)** No one is free from "mine" and "I". Whoever sees someone who is **free**
from "mine" and "I", sees wrong. (18.3)328 The point of the last verse is that someone who is free from the belief in **"mine"** and "I" must nevertheless be a person, a self; but a self does not **exist.** 
The verses that follow are especially interesting. Up to this point, Nāgā**rjuna**
has merely brought to light the internal contradictions of the phenomenal **world.** Beside this, he has refuted certain world-views, among them that of the Sarvāstivādins. The idea that the phenomenal world is unreal, however, was the common property of almost all Buddhists in his days. Nāgārjuna's own contribution is to provide a method to prove it. His proof concerns a **relatively** minor part of the Buddhist religion. The latter's main aim is liberation. In what way is Nāgārjuna's method of use for attaining this aim? The next verses of the eighteenth chapter deal with this **question:**
When views pertaining to "mine" and "I", whether associated with the internal or the external, have ceased, then clinging (upādāna) ends. With the ceasing of that, birth ceases. **(18.4)**
 

328 MadhK(deJ) chapter 18. Cf. Vetter, 1982: 176 f.

Here again, Nāgārjuna does not state anything new. The old discourses and **even** the Buddha's so-called first discourse call the knowledge of the non-self **liberating** knowledge. The same, or a similar, knowledge still seems to play a comparable **role** for Nāgārjuna. The text **continues:**
Liberation (mokṣa) results from the cessation of actions (*karman*) and defilements (kleśa). Actions and defilements result from **representations**
(*vikalpa*). These from false imagining (*prapañca*). False imagining **stops** in emptiness (śū*nyat*ā). **(18.5)**
The Buddhas have communicated that there is a self. They have taught **that**
there is no self. And they have taught that there is neither self nor **non-self.** (18.6)
The nameable (abhidhā*tavya*) has ceased; the domain of mind (*cittagocara*)
has ceased. For the essence of dharmas (*dharmat*ā) is without arising and disappearing, like Nirvāṇa. **(18.7)**
It is easy to recognise certain themes here which we have met earlier. The **diversity** of the phenomenal world is conditioned by representations and by naming - **i.e.,** by words. But it disappears when representations and cognising stop.329 This **happens**
when the practitioner gains insight into emptiness. Emptiness is precisely **what** Nāgārjuna's method teaches. In this emptiness, the diversity of the **phenomenal** world is removed, representations disappear, followed by actions and **defilements,** and liberation takes place. At the same time, Nāgārjuna offers a solution to the problem which preoccupied the Pudgalavādins and their opponents. Both can, **with** some justification, cite passages which support their point of view. In reality, the Buddha - more precisely, the Buddhas - enunciated these contradictions in **order** to proclaim the highest **truth.**
It is hardly necessary to emphasise that Nāgārjuna's thought raises - and indeed has raised through the ages - many more questions that have been dealt **with** above. It has given rise to many different points of view, in modern research **too.** This is not the occasion to discuss these points of view, which are often **based** on faulty interpretations.330 What is important here is that Nāgārjuna's **thought** is determined, to a significant extent, by the difference between limited **truth**
(saṃvṛ*tisatya*) and highest truth (paramā*rthasatya*). The phenomenal world **does**
not exist in highest truth, but it has limited reality. Likewise the Buddha, his teaching, liberation, and even Nāgārjuna's arguments, only have limited **reality.** But this limited reality has its use and is even necessary in order to reach **liberation,** Nirvāṇa. This is what Nāgārjuna explains in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā:
(Objection:) If all this is empty and there is no arising and ceasing, **then** there are no Four Noble Truths for you. **(24.1)** In the absence of the Four Noble Truths, understanding, **relinquishing,** cultivation, and realization will not be possible. **(24.2)** In the absence of this [fourfold activity], there are no four noble fruits. In the absence of the fruits, neither those who have attained the fruits nor **those** who have reached the way [to such attainment] exist. **(24.3)** If the eight types of individuals do not exist, there will be no **congregation.** In the absence of the noble truths, there is no true doctrine. **(24.4)** When the doctrine and the congregation are non-existent, how can **there** be an enlightenend one (*buddha*)? Speaking in this manner, you contradict the three jewels [i.e., the Buddha, the doctrine and the congregation]. **(24.5)** You [also] contradict emptiness, the reality of the fruits, both evil and **virtue,** and all worldly conventions. **(24.6)** (Answer:) We say that you do not comprehend the purpose of **emptiness,** emptiness, and the meaning of emptiness. That is why you are **repelled.** (24.7) The teaching of the doctrine by the Buddhas is based upon two truths: **truth**
in a limited sense (saṃvṛ*tisatya*) of ordinary life, and truth in in the **highest**
sense. **(24.8)** Those who do not understand the distinction between these two truths do not understand the profound truth embodied in the Buddha's message. **(24.9)** Without relying upon convention, the ultimate fruit is not taught. **Without**
understanding the ultimate, Nirvāṇa is not attained. (24.10)331 It will be clear that Nāgārjuna does not merely state his conclusions, he often **tries** to prove them. Reflections on the correct way to draw conclusions had started **early** in India and it is possible that Nāgārjuna himself contributed a treatise in **this**
field.332 Although some of his arguments are not convincing from a logical **point** of view, many others are logically irreproachable. Logic and epistemology **underwent** him), primarily linked with the names of Vasubandhu and Dignāga (both **perhaps** belonging to the 5th century CE). Some of Nāgārjuna's followers, starting **with** Bhāvaviveka (6th century), took pains to present their master's **arguments** in a manner that agrees with the requirements of the logic of their time. **However,** whether the arguments are formulated in Nāgārjuna's own terms or in **those** imposed by later developments of logic, their main weakness is not, as **some**
scholars seem to think,333 their logic, but the premises on which they are **based.**
These premises primarily concern ideas about the relationship between words and things. 

The question of Nāgārjuna's influence on later Indian thinkers **must** be reserved for a separate study.334 The question will come up briefly **below,** in connection with Dignāga. Here we must briefly examine if and how the Sarvāstivādins - who were among the main targets of Nāgārjuna's attacks - **reacted** to his criticism. No explicit response of the Sarvāstivādins to Nāgārjuna has survived; perhaps it never existed. To my knowledge, modern research has **never**
dealt with this problem.335 We can therefore only make a brief, but **important,**
observation: the Sarvāstivāda system was to a fair extent immune to Nāgā**rjuna's** main attacks. Nāgārjuna maintains that an object can only originate if it **already** exists. But this is Sarvāstivāda doctrine, according to which past and future **exist.** A future object already exists before it is produced, i.e., before it enters into the present. The difference is that only a present object is endowed with **efficiency.** Many of Nāgārjuna's arguments, which are often concerned with causality, are in this way answered in a more or less satisfactory **fashion.** 
Further developments in Mahāyāna With the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and the Madhyamaka, Buddhism had, in a **certain** sense, developed in this particular direction as far as it could possibly go. The **idea** that the phenomenal world does not really exist had become prominent **some** centuries after the death of the historical Buddha. This trend had started with the negation of the person and had soon been extended to all composite objects. The dharmas were all that was left. In the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and the **Madhyamaka,** no place remains even for the dharmas, or for any kind of higher **existence.** As we have said, it is impossible to go further in this **direction.**
We should not however think that the development of Mahāyāna ends **with**
the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras. Quite on the contrary Mahāyāna **Buddhism** is characterized by a variety of different views and doctrines. We have seen that the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras allude to some kind of highest existence. And **indeed,** Mahāyāna literature - or at least that part of it which has come **down** to us - contains much that cannot easily be fitted into the scheme of **completely**
"emptying" the world. One Mahāyāna Sūtra, the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, **goes** so far as to state that the teaching was proclaimed in three "turns of the **wheel** of Dharma".336 The first "turn" concerns the teaching of the Śrāvakayāna. The descriptions of the second and third turns are so unclear that they have given **rise** to various interpretations.337 Whatever their correct interpretation, they testify to the fact that there an awareness of the differences between the various **developments** which took place in Mahāyāna. Views arose that are quite independent of **notions** of the emptiness of the world. Moreover, these views at first betrayed **little** or no mutual relationship. The historical study of many of these views still stands in its infancy, so that it is impossible to give a satisfactory and complete picture of it. We must restrict ourselves to a brief presentation of a few of them in their **historical** development. This will convey a first impression of the complicated early **history** of Mahāyāna teachings. It is important to distinguish this early history from the attempts by later thinkers to harmonise these manifold ideas into a single **coherent** reach internal consistency in their ideas. Such efforts seem to have been the exception rather than the **rule.**
We shall first discuss the concept of "body of teaching" (*dharmak*āya), **whose**
origin is to be looked for in the old discourses. Shortly before his death, the **Buddha**
told his disciple Ānanda:338 "It may be that you will think: 'The **Teacher's**
instruction has ceased, now we have no teacher!' It should not be seen like **this,**
Ānanda, for what I have taught and explained to you as Dhamma (Skt. *dharma*) and discipline (*vinaya*) will, at my passing, be your teacher." Elsewhere, too, the Buddha identifies himself with his teaching:339 "Who sees the teaching sees me; who sees me sees the teaching". And once, the expression *dhammak*āya **(Skt.** dharmakāya) is used as an adjective qualifying the Buddha, in the sense of **"whose**
body is the doctrine".340 Paul Harrison has shown that the expression *dharmak*āya was retained for some time, even in the later Mahāyāna Sūtras, in the **sense** of
"whose body is the teaching", or "who is embodied in the teaching".341 **This**
expression here always designates the Buddha, or the Buddhas, who **is/are**
embodied in the teaching. The expression *dharmak*āya, however, was **also**
beginning to be used as a substantive with several meanings, because its two constitutent words *dharma* and kāya have two meanings each. *Dharma* means **"the**
teaching" and "mental property" (and of course "element of existence", a **meaning**
which became all-important in Buddhism). Kāya means "body" as **well** as
"collection". *Dharmak*āya can therefore mean "collection of the teaching",342 but very soon it is also found in the sense "collection of mental properties", **where** it designates the special mental properties which belong to a Buddha. The **meaning** of dharmakāya as "collection of dharmas" or even "totality of dharmas" **appeared**
somewhat **later.**
So far, the use of the expression *dharmak*āya is in no way different **from**
what can be found in non-Mahāyāna Buddhist teachings. In certain Sū**tras,** however, the expression receives a broader meaning in accordance, it seems, **with**
the need for a highest existence. Thus, the Anūnatvāpūrṇ*atvanirde*śa declares on the one hand that the *dharmak*āya consists of all the good properties of a **perfected**
being, and on the other, that it is a thing which has no parts.343 This implies that the dharmakāya is thought of as something that really exists.344 *Dharmak*āya is **here**
equated with *dharmadh*ātu "element of the dharmas", i.e., with the totality of **what**
exists.345 An even more interesting equivalence is found in the texts of the **so-called**
Tathāgatagarbha tradition.346 Tathā*gatagarbha* means "embryo of the Buddha".347 This expression springs from the idea that all living beings carry, and have **always** carried, in themselves their own Buddhahood in a latent form, veiled by **external** impurities caused by passions and other earthly factors. When the living **being** is freed from these accidental impurities and its "support is **transformed"**
(āśrayaparivṛtti),348 then the Tathāgatagarbha, the 'Buddha-embryo', becomes the dharmakāya, the "body of the teaching (*dharma*, sing.) and of the **perfected**
properties (*dharma*, plur.)", i.e., the absolute aspect of fully **realised**
Buddhahood.349 In their essence, Tathāgatagarbha and *dharmak*āya are **therefore**
identical. Moreover, the Tathāgatagarbha is conceived of as something that **really** exists. It is indeed the "highest reality", which has no fundamental connection **with**
the doctrine of universal emptiness.350 Various texts apply predicates to the Tathāgatagarbha and to the dharmakāya such as 'eternal' (*nitya*), 'unchanging' (*dhruva*), 'joyful' (*sukha*), **'self'**
(ā*tman*) and 'pure' (śubha, śuci).351 We recognise without difficulty the **concept** of the self which had been rejected by the Buddha. It appears that this concept **held** such a powerful sway that certain Buddhists could not resist it. We have **already** come to know one of the reasons for this attraction: it was unclear to **many** Buddhists why and how the Buddhist path could lead to liberation from **rebirths.** This explanation does not rule out the possibility that the notion of the Tathāgatagarbha as an eternal and joyful self may have originated **within** Buddhism, without non-Buddhist influence; or even that later non-Buddhists may have borrowed this notion from the Buddhists, as some scholars hold.352 **There** is no need to examine these possibilities in detail. Certainly the similarity between **this** notion of the Tathāgatagarbha and the self of the non-Buddhists is so striking **that**
the Buddhist texts themselves comment on it. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra **contains** a passage where the Bodhisattva Mahāmati asks the Buddha the following **question:**
Now the Blessed One makes mention of the Tathāgata-garbha in the Sū**tras,** and verily it is described by you as by nature bright and pure, as **primarily** unspotted, endowed with the thirty-two marks of excellence, hidden in the body of every being like a gem of great value, which is enwrapped in a **dirty**
garment, enveloped in the garment of aggregates (*skandha*), **elements**
(dhātu), and realms of the senses (ā*yatana*), and soiled with the dirt of **greed,**
anger, folly and false imagination, while it is described by the Blessed One to be eternal, permanent, wholesome, and unchangeable. Is not **this**
Tathāgata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the self (ā*tman*)
taught by the non-Buddhist philosophers (tī*rthakara*)? The self as **taught** in the systems of the non-Buddhist philosophers is an eternal **creator,**
unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable.353 It is hardly surprising that this representation of the Tathāgatagarbha - **outrageous**
from a Buddhist point of view - was soon weakened.354 In one of the **solutions**
proposed this doctrine was looked upon as not ultimate, requiring an **interpretation**
(neyā*rtha*),355 not to be taken literally (nītā*rtha*). Another solution was to **interpret** it in the light of other Mahāyāna doctrines, mainly the doctrines of **selflessness** responsible for the fact that the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine in India became **more** or less absorbed by the Yogācāra school, as seems to have happened.356 Certain **works**
of this school which are attributed to Maitreyanātha, contain ideas which are **still**
very close to the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine.357 We will now examine some **other**
aspects of this **school.** 
Yogācāra means 'activity of yoga' and also 'one whose activity is yoga', **i.e.**
'yogin'.358 The word *yoga* here appears in a Buddhist context, in the **sense** of
'spiritual practice'.359 It was not yet used in this sense in the old discourses. **Outside**
Buddhism, however, it was used early in this sense, especially in the Mahābhā*rata*,
the great Sanskrit epic,360 where it designates the path leading to liberation **that** is characterised by effort: the first meaning of *yoga* is 'yoking', hence 'effort'. In the Mahābhā*rata*, the path of effort is opposed to the path of knowledge (sāṃ*khya*).361 For all practical purposes, epic yoga consists of ascetic practices in which **physical**
and mental immobility play a major role.362 Although such practices were **adopted**
by Buddhism at an early date, it does not use the term *yoga* to refer to them **until**
much later. Accordingly, it is likely that Buddhist and non-Buddhist ascetics **were** in contact not only at the beginning (as has been argued in Chapter Two), but **also**
later. The adoption of the word *yoga* in Buddhism undoubtedly indicates **influence**
of non-Buddhist currents on Buddhism. Influence in the opposite direction **also** took place and will be discussed **below.**
Let us return to Yogācāra. "This school is usually considered to **belong** to Mahāyāna. Indeed, all later Yogācāra texts propagate primarily the Mahāyāna **path**
to liberation. But the oldest materials found in the voluminous Yogācā*rabh*ūmi, 363 which was compiled at the latest at the beginning of the 4th century CE, contain not only passages of a clearly Mahāyāna orientation, but also passages which **still**
entirely rest on traditional, so-called Hīnayāna Buddhism." 364 Yogācāra is **rooted,** so to say, in pre- or non-Mahāyāna Buddhism.365 This is especially true of **various**
ideas which this school used and adopted while developing its **doctrine.**
One of the most important works of classical Yogācāra is Asaṅ**ga's**
"Summary of Mahāyāna" (Mahāyānasaṃ*graha*), which was written around the fourth century CE.366 This work exposes the main tenets of the school, and discusses them in detail. We shall briefly present some of the concepts **discussed** in this work with an eye on their historical development367 and will see that they had to be profoundly modified before they could take their place in the classical **system.**
As we have seen, spiritual practice (or reflections on it) may have **influenced**
or even determined certain developments within Mahāyāna; the doctrine of the unreal nature of appearances was discussed as an example. This doctrine, we **saw,** may be the ontological equivalent of the Attainment of **Cessation**
(nirodhasamā*patti*). It was also connected with visualisation **practices.**
The same is possibly true of the notion of Ālayavijñāna, a term **which** is sometimes translated as "Fundamental Consciousness". This notion was **destined** to play an important role in Mahāyāna. It is very different from the doctrine of the unreal nature of appearances. Nevertheless, there are reasons to suppose that the Ālayavijñāna was, at its inception, closely connected with reflections about the state of Attainment of Cessation. This is Lambert Schmithausen's thesis, **which** seems to find confirmation in the **texts.**
The problem that the Ālayavijñāna may have been invented to solve, **then,** is linked to the Attainment of Cessation. In this state there is neither **ideation** (saṃjñā)
nor feeling (*vedayita*). This was understood to mean that mind (*citta*) and **mental** dharmas (*caitasika*) are absent. While discussing the Pañcavastuka, we saw **that** mind (*citta*) and consciousness (*vijñ*āna) correspond to each other. **There** is therefore no consciousness in the Attainment of Cessation: it **represents** an interruption of the sequence of mental dharmas. The question now is: how can a person who has sojourned in this state come back to consciousness? **Mental** dharmas normally succeed each other in a continuous sequence. **After** an interruption like the Attainment of Cessation there are no mental dharmas **which** could produce succeeding ones. Nevertheless, the ancient discourses proclaim **that** it is possible to return from the Attainment of **Cessation.** 
This problem was not exclusive to the Yogācāras. The Sarvāstivādins, **too,**
had to confront it, but they had their own solution. For them the past exists. **Past** mental dharmas can therefore directly bring forth new dharmas, in spite of the distance in time.368 In Yogācāra this solution was not possible because it did not accept the existence of the **past.**
There is a canonical text which claims that there is consciousness (*vijñ*āna)
in the Attainment of Cessation. How is this possible? A passage of the Yogācā*rabh*ūmi, called *Initial Passage* by Schmithausen, answers this **question** in the following **manner:**
When [a person] has entered [Attainment of] **Cessation**
(nirodha(samā*patti)*), his mind and mental [factors] have ceased; how, **then,**
is it that [his] mind (*vijñ*āna) has not withdrawn from [his] body? - **[Answer:**
No problem;] for [in] his [case] Ālayavijñāna has not ceased [to be **present]** in the material sense-faculties, which are unimpaired: [Ālayavijñāna] **which** comprises (/possesses / has received) the Seeds of the forthcoming **[forms**
of] mind (pravṛ*ttivijñ*āna), so that they are bound to re-arise in future **(i.e.**
after emerging from this attainment).369 It is likely that in this passage the word Ālayavijñāna is used in its oldest **meaning.** The presence of the Ālayavijñāna explains how one can survive a sojourn in the Attainment of Cessation, and how one can come out of it and obtain **consciousness** again. It becomes clear that in this case the Ālayavijñāna cannot be **conscious.** If it were conscious, experience would be possible in the Attainment of Cessation and this would contradict the traditional description of this **state.**
The problem which is solved by postulating the Ālayavijñāna has in **itself**
nothing to do with specifically Mahāyānist concerns. It is possible that this **concept** had existed for a long time in non-Mahāyāna circles before it was adopted **into** Mahāyāna. It is neither possible nor necessary to examine here the **complicated** history of the meaning of this word, as this has been done by Schmithausen, but some of the new functions which came to be attributed to the Ālayavijñāna in **later**
times can be considered.370 The Ālayavijñāna came to be considered the **individual**
substratum of the cycle of rebirths (saṃsāra), and even of liberation. Moreover, the Ālayavijñāna came to serve as a link between actions and their effects. It also **came**
to function as the bearer of impressions (vāsanā) and seeds (bīja), or was **itself**
considered a seed having a future effect. It was the basis for the sense of 'I', **which** it explains in this way, and the principle which is responsible for a new life **after** death.

This enumeration of functions shows how close the later Ālayavijñāna **came**
to the notion of a self.371 By rejecting the self, Buddhism had created a **problem**
which kept cropping up in various ways in the course of its history. The **doctrine** of non-self had given rise to the developed dharma theory, and to the **doctrine** of emptiness in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and Madhyamaka. In Mahāyāna, we **find** different examples of the way in which Buddhist thinkers tried to find a **substitute** for the self. One of these is the Ālayavijñāna.

The notion of the Ālayavijñāna found a place in classical Yogācāra **beside**
another doctrine which became famous under the names "mind-only" (cittamātra)
and "making-known-only" (vijñaptimātra). According to this doctrine, any cognition or perception has as object an image that exists in cognition itself, not a real object that exists outside cognition. Knowledge is "mind-only" or "makingknown only"; no corresponding external object is cognised. In this **doctrine,** it is to remember this, for the doctrine is sometimes called "idealism" in **modern** scholarly literature - a custom which we sometimes follow. The existence of the external world could yet easily be reconciled with the manifold series of **individual**
consciousnesses that are accepted in the texts.373 As far as the origin of this doctrine is concerned, it is once **again**
Schmithausen who has emphasised, and tried to prove, its connection with the practice of meditation, especially with the spiritual technique of visualising.374 We know that spiritual experiences were used to demonstrate the emptiness of all dharmas. We also know that, at least on one occasion, the conclusion was **drawn** from these experiences - or at least from the way they were thought of - that the phenomenal world is created by the mind and therefore unreal and that only the mind is real. This idea subsequently became an essential part of Yogācāra **doctrine.**
Thus in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, the "Discourse of the Unraveling of the Hidden Meaning", we find the claim that the images which are made the **objects** of contemplation are not different from the mind, for they are nothing **beyond**
"making-known only" (vijñaptimātra). To prove this, the Sūtra adduces a **saying** of the Buddha, which is apparently interpreted as a proof of the ideal, i.e. not objectively real, nature of the objects of contemplation.375 The Saṃ*dhinirmocana* Sūtra, however, goes one step further. In the paragraph that immediately **follows,** it explains that ordinary objects, too - i.e., the objects of ordinary perception - are not different from the mind, and are not external to the act of making-known. They are mere images in the mind. Schmithausen concludes from these and other **similar** reflections: "The Yogācāras' universal idealism arose from reflections **about** a certain spiritual practice, and from the generalisation of the conditions **observed** during this **practice."**
This main doctrine of the Yogācāras could also be explained differently.376 We have met the doctrine of "mere designation" (prajñaptimātra etc.) before, for the first time in the dialogue between the monk Nāgasena and King **Menander.** Later, this doctrine became the common property of various Buddhist **schools,** whether or not they were Mahāyāna. The doctrine of "making-known **only"**
(vijñaptimātra) shares certain elements with the doctrine of "mere **designation"**
(prajñaptimātra), and we cannot rule out that the former arose from the latter. For the doctrine of "mere designation" states that the objects of the phenomenal **world** are nothing but designations or denominations. Who gives the objects **their** designations? If we assume that we are the ones who do this - and for the Buddhists there is no other possibility - we must conclude that the **phenomenal** appearances denoted by these denominations are likewise attributed to the **objects** by us. They are therefore, in reality, our representations. Between this and the conclusion that knowledge is mind-only only a small step **remains.** 
One more point must be added. The rejection of the person was a **perpetual**
source of problems in Buddhism. For instance, if there is no person, how can the dharmas of one person be distinguished from those of another? And how can the continuity of a person be explained if there is no person? The fruit of an **action** belongs to the person who has performed it. How is this possible? We have **seen** how the Sarvāstivādins tried to solve this problem and also that the later Yogācāra used the Ālayavijñāna as a connection between actions and their results. The Sarvāstivādins' solution, however, was not universally accepted, and the **solution** of the later Yogācāra does not help us to understand the early history of this **school.**
We know that the Buddhists cultivated the notion of a **"series"** or
"uninterrupted succession" (saṃtāna). The so-called "uninterrupted **succession** of mind" (citta-saṃtati or -saṃtāna) often played the role of "pseudo-self".377 **This**
"uninterrupted succession of mind" made it possible to explain the relation **between** actions and their fruits. The circumstance that, in Buddhism, actions were not considered to be purely physical, but rather to be mental, made this explanation all the more convincing.378 Only the fruits of actions posed a problem, for they are not always mental. For instance, when a being is punished for past crimes in hell, his or her experiences are not only mental: the guardians of hell play an important **role** in these punishments.379 The *Abhidharmako*śa makes the following general **statement:**
the diversity of the world is produced by actions.380 How is it possible for **actions** to produce non-mental effects? This problem would at least partly be resolved if one could believe that "this [whole world] consisting of three spheres is **mind-only**
(cittamātra)", as the oldest known passage dealing with this topic puts it. **This** is also what Vasubandhu says in the commentary to his Viṃś*atik*ā:
381 "You **imagine**
that elements arise and change in such a way through the activities of the inhabitants of hell. The impression (vāsanā) of those activities attaches to **their**
continuity of consciousness, not somewhere else. Why then do you not accept **that** there where the impression is also its results appears, viz. a corresponding **change** of consciousness? For what reason do you imagine that its fruit appears there **where** the impression is **not?"**
It would be vain to try to choose between these explanations. It is likely **that**
they supported and strengthened each other. It is probably impossible to **determine** whether the idealism of the Yogācāra really arose from experiences of **meditation** (or ideas about such experiences) and was subsequently strengthened by **reflections** about the doctrine of "designation only", or the other way round, and we will not try to do so. The important point is that the idealistic doctrine of Yogācāra was not born in a vacuum. Here too, as so often in the development of Buddhist **doctrine,** there is a continuity with older ideas and **practices.**
Although it may no longer be possible to establish which role the **doctrine** of designation-only (prajñaptimātra) played in the development of the **doctrine** of making-known only (vijñaptimātra), it is possible and even important, to **mention**
the mutual relationship of these two doctrines in classical Yogācāra. This can be done by considering the doctrine of the triple nature, or triple constitution of **things,** to which we now **turn.**
The starting point of this doctrine are the two truths, limited **truth**
(saṃvṛ*tisatya*) and highest truth (paramā*rthasatya*).382 Limited truth, which is **also**
known as "real in a limited sense" (saṃvṛ*tisat*), is conditioned by **language,** as we have repeatedly observed. In Yogācāra, the situation is somewhat **more** complicated than elsewhere in Buddhism. To put it briefly, in Yogācāra there is one more level, situated between the truth which is conditioned by language and the highest truth. As for other Buddhists, the truth conditioned by **language** is ultimately no truth at all. Rather, it is an imagined reality, which is **properly** speaking unreal. In the case of the Yogācāra school, this is the world of the **objects** that make up the phenomenal world. We imagine that these objects **exist** independently of our consciousness, but, according to Yogācāra, this is not the case. For nothing exists except the act of making-known. The texts speak of the imagined (*parikalpita*) nature (*svabh*āva) or characteristic (lakṣaṇa) of things. **This**
nature or characteristic is unreal, because the doctrine of "making-known **only"**
(vijñaptimātra) recognises no objects outside ourselves, only the act of makingknown. In other words, the dharmas which figure in the doctrine of **Conditioned**
Origination (pratī*tyasamutp*āda) and elsewere only condition the acts of makingknown and play no role in the objects of the phenomenal world, because these **latter**
do not exist. In this connection one speaks of the dependent (*paratantra*) **nature** or characteristic of things. This is not the highest truth, which the Yogācāras call the perfected (pariniṣ*panna*) nature or characteristic of things. The perfected **nature** of things is identical with the dependent nature, but is free from **representations,** which give rise to the belief that the imagined nature is **real.**
The doctrine of the triple constitution of things is already formulated in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. The following passages contain its most important **tenets.**
Here the Buddha is speaking to the Bodhisattva Guṇā**kara:**
The dharmas, Guṇākara, have three characteristics. Which are these **three?**
The imagined characteristic (*parikalpitalak*ṣaṇa), the **dependent** characteristic (*paratantralak*ṣaṇa) and the perfected **characteristic**
(pariniṣ*pannalak*ṣaṇa).

What, Guṇākara, is the imagined characteristic of the **dharmas?** It is each establishment of a name and of a convention for the dharmas **according** to essence or particularity, in order to designate them in everyday **linguistic** usage. 

What, Guṇākara, is the dependent characteristic of the **dharmas?** It is the dependent origination of the dharmas, namely, when this exists, **that** comes into being, following the production of this, that arises, **namely,** depending on ignorance the conditioned factors arise - (here follows the whole series of elements of Conditioned Origination, up to) - and thus **this** great mass of suffering **arises.** 
What, Guṇākara, is the perfected characteristic of the **dharmas?** It is the thusness (*tathat*ā) of the dharmas. It is seen by Bodhisattvas **through**
their energy and correct observation, and through the realisation of the practice of this vision. [This is] the realisation of the highest **perfect** enlightenment. 

[...] As the association with colour in the case of a clear **crystal,**
Guṇākara, likewise we must consider, in the case of the **dependent** characteristic, its impregnation - belonging to the imagined **characteristic** - by linguistic usage. Just as the mistaken perception of the clear **crystal** as saphire, ruby, emerald or gold, similarly we must consider the **mistaken** assumption of the dependent characteristic as the imagined **characteristic.** As the clear crystal itself, so we must consider the dependent **characteristic.** Just as the clear crystal is not established stably and lastingly as a **saphire,** ruby, emerald or gold, and is unreal, likewise we must consider the perfected characteristic, insofar as the dependent characteristic is not established stably and lastingly as the imagined characteristic, and is **unreal.**
We can recognise the imagined characteristic, Guṇākara, if we **base**
ourselves on the names linked with the images of the phenomenal **world.** We can recognise the dependent characteristic if we base ourselves on the conception of the dependent characteristic as imagined characteristic. And we can recognise the perfected characteristic if we base ourselves on the non-conception of the dependent characteristic as imagined characteristic.383 In this passage, the connection between imagined nature and **denominations** is obvious. It speaks, for instance, of the impregnation of this nature by **linguistic**
usage. Later, in Asaṅga's Mahāyānasaṃ*graha*, it is said that the **seeds** (bīja) of imagination (*parikalpa*) are the impressions of words (abhilāpavāsanā). **Dependent** own nature (*paratantra svabh*āva), on the other hand, is the act of **making-known**
only (vijñaptimātra); and acts of making-known have no existing objects.384
"Fundamental consciousness" (ā*layavijñ*āna), "the act of **making-known**
only" (vijñaptimātra) and the triple nature of things are essential **concepts** of classical Yogācāra, which are accordingly abundantly discussed in Asaṅ**ga's**
Mahāyānasaṃ*graha*.

385 This work also knows the concept of Dharmakāya, but interprets it differently from the Tathāgatagarbha school. This latter school **should** perhaps be understood as a reaction against the Yogācāra interpretation of **this**
concept.386 Nevertheless, the Dharmakāya of the Yogācāra school, too, **seems** to come close to the idea of a highest truth. This may be deduced from the **attributes**
which the Mahāyānasaṃ*graha* assigns to it.387 The Dharmakāya is, for **example,**
eternal (*nitya*), inconceivable (*acintya*), neither existing nor non-existing, **neither**
conditioned (saṃskṛta) nor non-conditioned, not produced by actions (*karman*),
neither many nor one. It can be reached through knowledge free **from**
representations (*nirvikalpakajñ*āna). This Dharmakāya is the support (āś*raya*) of the various Buddhas' bodies of enjoyment (saṃ*bhogak*āya) and bodies of **magical**
transformation (*nirm*āṇakāya). A discussion of these bodies has no place in **this**
book. Note however that these three bodies are the main constituents of the socalled "doctrine of the three bodies" of the Yogācāra **school.** 

## The Logico-Epistemological School

Buddhist teaching as we have examined it so far had much to say about the **nature** of reality. Quite early, the reality of the phenomenal world had come to be **denied.** Only the dharmas really exist according to the ancient systematisers. The **reality** of these dharmas, too, was subsequently subjected to doubt, especially by Mahāyā**nist** thinkers. Some of them went so far as to claim that in reality nothing exists at **all.** They even believed that they could logically prove this. Others claimed that our experience is mind-only, or making-known only, and came close to **denying** external reality. It seems that with Dignāga, who was active around the **beginning** of the 6th century, a change took place which allowed Buddhism to **successfully** combine various threads of its history. This change is expressed in Dignāga's **main**
work, the "Collection of valid means of knowledge", Pramāṇ*asamuccaya*.

It is almost certain that Dignāga did not deny the existence of **external**
reality.388 This does not mean that he accepted the existence of the dharmas, as the adepts of the Path of the Listeners (śrā*vakay*āna) did. According to Dignāga, external reality is the object of perception (*pratyak*ṣa). It is also **completely**
indescribable, for the very essence of perception is that it is free **from**
representations (*kalpan*ā).389 The object of perception is the "own **characteristic"**
(*svalak*ṣaṇa) of things. It is opposed to the reality described by words, **which**
concerns the general characteristic (sāmā*nyalak*ṣaṇa).390 Perception, then, **concerns**
external reality, while the reality described by words concerns **representations**
found in the mind. The same applies to the reality reached by inference.391 The realm of language and logic is therefore that of the general characteristic; it has a mental nature. The two realms - the realm of the own characteristic and the **realm** of the general characteristic - are completely different from each other and do not overlap, according to Dignāga. 

In this binary division, we recognise the division between a highest **reality**
and a reality conditioned by language which we met while discussing the **Path** of the Listeners. What is missing in Dignāga is a description of external **reality** in terms of the dharma theory. This means that Dignāga's external reality, unlike the dharma theory, is immune to Nāgārjuna's criticism. With Dignāga, **Buddhism** is once again in a position in which external reality can have its place without **this** time being endangered by Nāgārjuna's arguments and those of his **school.**
What about the realm of the general characteristic? This realm **consists** of representations in the mind. It does not therefore belong to external **reality.** Dignāga might have asserted, without running into difficulties, that it is nothing but a delusion without internal structure. Moreover, he might have defended the opinion that the realm of language and logic is subject to the contradictions **brought** to light by Nāgārjuna. But he did not do so. On the contrary, he developed a **theory** concerning the relationship between words and things - or, better, **between** language and reality - which permanently protects the reality that is **conditioned** by language against Nāgārjuna's attacks. This is the so-called *apoha* theory, **which**
was perhaps not exclusively invented for this reason, but which **nonetheless** annihilated once and for all the threat posed by the Mādhyamikas' **destructive** arguments. 

We know that Nāgārjuna's main arguments are based on the conviction **that**
there is a close parallelism between words and things. The words found in the proposition "Nāgārjuna writes a book" should, each of them, correspond to a **thing** or event in the situation described. But the book does not exist while it is **being** written, and therefore this proposition poses a problem, at least to Nāgārjuna and his disciples. This problem can, however, be solved in two different ways: **either** by admitting that the book somehow already exists before coming into **existence;** or by refusing to accept that the word "book" designates the concrete book **which** is being **written.**
The Sarvāstivādins did indeed believe that objects already exist **before**
coming into existence. Certain Brahmanical thinkers, especially those **belonging** to the schools of Sāṃkhya and Yoga, followed the Sarvāstivādins in this respect. For them, Nāgārjuna's attacks were therefore no real problem. Other **non-Buddhists** who were confronted with Nāgārjuna's challenge proposed various solutions **which** have one point in common, namely, that words do not exclusively **designate**
individual objects.392 In this context, the Naiyāyikas' point of view was **particularly**
important. They believed that words designate species (jāti); more precisely, **that** words can designate individual things (*vyakti*), forms (ākṛti) and **species** (jāti).

According to this theory, the word "book" in the proposition "Nāgārjuna **writes** a book" already designates something before the book has come into existence, for the species exists already before the individual book comes into being. The Naiyāyikas, and all of those who shared this view, could therefore stick to the premise that the words which occur in a proposition each correspond to a **thing** or event that are part of the situation described. For according to the Naiyā**yikas,** species are things, too. This solution was not acceptable to the Buddhists, **because** they had no place for species in their ontology. Thus, those Buddhists who did not share the Sarvāstivādins' point of view still feared Nāgārjuna's **challenge.**
This is where the *apoha* theory finally brought relief. The *apoha* **theory**
made it possible to explain the denotation of words in such a way that all the advantages of the assumption of species could be used, but without **having** to accept their existence. This was of course a revolutionary change in a **tradition** which had always taken for granted that words correspond to something, **even** if not necessarily to individual things. According to Dignāga, words no **longer** correspond to something, not even to something which is only real in a **limited** sense. There is simply nothing which corresponds to words. And yet, **denotation** takes place in such a manner that it looks as if there were **species.**
How does Dignāga manage to develop and support such a theory? Note **here**
that Dignāga was a competent logician, who made an important contribution to **this** field. In logic the following rule applies: In a correct inference the **consequence** must be present where the reason is present, and where the consequence is not present, the reason is not present either. Dignāga had, as a matter of fact, been the first to formulate this insight clearly.393 An example will elucidate what it is **about.**
The statement "There is fire on the mountain because there is smoke" is the traditional example of a correct inference. It is correct, because wherever **there** is smoke, there is fire, too. The opposite is not always true: there can be fire **without** smoke. But where there is no fire, there is certainly no smoke either. This **last** observation shows that a correct inference necessarily involves exclusion. For instance, it says something about all objects that are without fire, and about all objects that are without smoke, namely, "where there is no fire there is no **smoke".** The collection of all objects without fire is a subgroup of the collection of all objects without **smoke.** 
Dignāga now claims that denotation takes place in a way which is **similar,** or even identical, to inference. A word - for instance "book" - refers to a **great** number of objects, namely, to all books. It is not always possible to establish the precise relationship between the word and all these objects. What is certain is **that**
whatever is not a book is not connected with the word book.394 From this **point** of view, denotation is exclusion (*apoha*). The word "book" does not designate all books: rather, it excludes all **"non-books".** 
Denotation as exclusion explains without difficulty how expressions **like**
"white lotus" can be used. The two words "white " and "lotus" do not **designate** two objects. On the contrary, together they designate one object, namely a **white** lotus, or, as the case may be, all white lotuses. But a white lotus is not a combination of everything that is white and everything that is lotus. Rather, the word "white" excludes everything that is not white, and the word "lotus" **excludes** everything that is not a lotus. What remains after this double exclusion is a **white** lotus, or, as the case may be, all white lotuses. Note further that since the two words "white" and "lotus" in the expression "white lotus" designate together one single object, they do not in this case designate anything on their own.395 This way of understanding the relationship between words and **things** –
which was new for the Buddhists - had important consequences. Previously **words** had been linked to individual objects, and on this basis it had been **impossible** to say much about the structure of reality as conditioned by language. This **situation**
now changes drastically. In the *apoha* theory, different words no longer **simply**
stand next to each other on the same level. A clear hierarchy is established **among** words, and therefore also among the things conditioned by words. To put it differently, the world conditioned by words has a structure. Consider the **word**
'śiṃśapā'. It designates a tree of a certain species, or, according to the *apoha* theory, it excludes all objects which are not śiṃśapā-trees. By a similar **process** of exclusion, the word 'tree' designates a collection of objects which includes all śiṃśapā-trees. Thus the word 'tree' is hierachically superior to the **word** 'śiṃśapā'.

It is, on the other hand, inferior to the word 'earthy' (i.e., made of earth), for all trees are earthy, but not all earthy things are trees. 'Earthy' is in its **turn** subordinated to the word 'substance', and so on. In this way a pyramidal **structure** develops. On the top of this pyramid the all-encompassing concept **'knowable'**
(*jñeya*) is found. The knowable is either existent (sat) or non-existent (*asat*). Not much can be said about the non-existent. The existent, on the other hand, is **said** to be of three kinds: it is either substance (*dravya*), property (guṇa), or **activity**
(*karman*). We shall not go into the further subdivisions of these three **categories.**
Suffice it to say that for Dignāga the structure of reality, which can be **grasped** by words, displays a great similarity with the structure of the Brahmanical **system** of Vaiśeṣika. In both cases, the existent is first divided into substances, properties and activities.396 This is not surprising in itself, for both Dignāga and the Vaiśeṣika system follow the model of language - i.e., the Sanskrit language - to **systematise**
reality.397 And the Sanskrit language contains primarily substantives, adjectives and verbs, to which substances, properties and activities correspond.398 If we now summarise Dignāga's understanding of reality, we must note **that**
he preserves the two traditional 'levels' of Buddhism. For him, too, **there** is a highest reality and an apparent reality. Highest reality cannot be **described** by words, and is only accessible through perception. Apparent reality, on the **other** hand, can not only be described by language, it is conditioned by it. But **neither** highest reality nor apparent reality are contradictory in themselves. **Apparent** reality obtains in this way internal coherence; and highest reality is free **from** contradictions for the simple reason that nothing can be said about it.

It can, however, be perceived. It seems as if this pure **perception,**
unconnected with representation, was a goal to be pursued. Dignāga does not explicitly say so. He only mentions the yogins' perception, which is free **from**
representation (*vikalpa*).399 It is likely that for Dignāga this pure **perception**
constituted liberating insight, just as perception without representation was liberating insight for other adepts of Mahāyāna, as we have seen. This **perception** - and strictly speaking it is the only perception there is - cannot have a false **object,**
for false objects are only mistakes of the mind.400 Why does Dignāga not explain in his Pramāṇ*asamuccaya* how to **reach**
liberation? This is probably to be accounted for by his purpose, not to **write** a religious but rather a logico-epistemological work. In his introduction, he **states** that the aim of his book is to reject other theories in this field, and to expose his own theory.401 He does not say what the knowledge it describes is good **for,**
presumably because this would have been obvious to every **Buddhist.** 
With Dignāga, Buddhism reached a new phase in its **development.** An advanced logic and theory of knowledge made it possible to renew traditional **ideas** and to develop a refined ontology. This development did not end with Dignāga. Other Buddhist and non-Buddhist thinkers continued to discuss, criticise and develop his ideas. It is not possible to examine these further developments **here.** Suffice it to say that the fundamental ingredients of these later developments **were** already present in Dignāga's **work.**

# 5. Final **Observations**

The preceding presentation of Buddhist teaching in India is not exhaustive. **Many**
thinkers and ideas are not dealt with. The third Vehicle after the Śrāvakayāna and the Mahāyāna, viz. the Mantrayāna or Vajrayāna which constitutes **Tantric** Buddhism, has been left out altogether. All that can be said here about this **third** Vehicle is that it differs from the earlier forms of Buddhism by its frequent use of magical formulas and rites. In spite of this, the continuity that links this new Vehicle with the forms of Buddhism we have studied is undeniable. The **magical**
power of the Bodhisattvas, for example, played a role in Mahāyāna, and was **rooted** in the idea that "the true nature of dharmas is illusory". The use and **potency** of magical formulas is also easy to understand if we remember that for **most** Buddhists the phenomenal world is a reflection of language. As a result, power can be obtained over the phenomenal world through language. Similar ideas **were**
prevalent in India outside Buddhism.402 Some points remain to be discussed in this final chapter. These are: (1)
Buddhist hermeneutics, (2) the influence of Buddhism on other, **non-Buddhist** developments in India, and (3) some important landmarks in the **developments** described **here.** 

## 1. Hermeneutics

The development of Buddhist teaching in India was not one-dimensional. **Indeed,** it would be hard to imagine greater differences than those between certain ideas and practices common in Mahāyāna and those which characterise **Abhidharma** Buddhism. Both, in their turn, are radically different from the teachings of the historical Buddha. Nevertheless, they are all forms of Buddhism. All the conceptions and ideas which we have discussed, and all the spiritual **practices** connected with them, are supposedly based on the words of the Buddha. How did the Buddhists explain this variety based on a shared **claim?**
There could only be one explanation. Obviously certain Buddhists had not correctly understood the words of the Buddha. Understanding them correctly was of the greatest significance. This concern gave rise to the **development** of hermeneutics, of a method of **interpretation.**
According to the older tradition, the words of the Buddha were **established**
in various councils which were held after the Buddha's death. The word **'council'** is used in modern research; the Indian word - saṅgīti or saṅgāyanā - means **'common**
recitation', and thus emphasises the aspect of establishing the words of the Buddha:403 the words of the Buddha were established in the memory of the **monks**
through common recitation. There could be no question of writing them **down,** at least not in the earlier days, for no script was used in India at that time.404 In spite of these councils, no agreement was reached as to which texts **could**
and could not be ascribed to the Buddha. The disagreement began during the **first** council, supposedly held in Rājagṛha shortly after the Buddha's demise, **where** a monk called Purāṇa did not join the council because he preferred to remember the words of the Buddha as he had heard and marked them: "Well recited, sirs, was the doctrine and the discipline by the older monks. However, I will remember **[these** two] exactly as I heard them and received them directly from the mouth of the Exalted One."405 Nor do the accounts of the first council agree as to what **exactly**
was recited. Some say that the Basket of the Discipline (Vinaya-piṭaka) and the Basket of Discourses (Sūtra-piṭaka) were recited. Others add to these the **Basket** of Scholasticism (Abhidharma-piṭaka). Many modern scholars doubt that this **council**
was ever **held.** 
The old Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra attributes to the Buddha rules for **examining**
the authenticity of texts and thus for their acceptance as his teaching. If a **monk** claims that he has heard the teaching or the discipline in this or that form from the monk, this should neither be accepted without proof, nor rejected; in such a **case,** one must find out whether the opinions presented agree with the Sūtra in **terms** of doctrine, and whether they agree exactly - perhaps what is meant is **"word** by word" - with the Vinaya.406 These rules did not solve all problems. In later times, especially after the **rise**
of Mahāyāna, a plethora of new texts appeared which were accepted by **many** Buddhists as the authentic words of the Buddha. The words attributed to the Buddha in this manner do not always agree with each other. If one accepts all of these texts as authentic, some will have to be interpreted in round-about **ways** so as to avoid contradictions. One statement attributed to the Buddha does indeed **allow** one to proceed in this manner. According to this statement four rules **should** be observed:407 One must rely upon the doctrine, not on the person; upon the **meaning,**
not on the sound; upon a discourse which can be taken literally (nītā*rtha*), not on one which must be interpreted (neyā*rtha*); upon direct cognition (jñāna), not on discursive cognition (*vijñ*āna). Inevitably these rules were often used to prove **that**
one's own opinion was correct. The belief that the Buddha had pronounced **certain**
discourses which needed interpretation (neyā*rtha*) and others which **were** to be taken literally (nītā*rtha*) was particularly helpful for those who wished to **justify**
their own convictions. The question of *which* sayings need interpretation and *which* are to be taken literally predictably led to differences of opinion. The **rule** according to which one must rely upon direct cognition probably **favoured** Mahāyāna **Buddhism.**
The Buddhists, then, had a double strategy to deal with the **multiplicity** of teachings that were attributed to the Buddha. First of all there were rules **which** were meant to distinguish between authentic and spurious discourses. Second, the authentic discourses had to be sifted, too: some were to be taken literally, **others** had to be "interpreted". In spite of this double strategy, differences of **opinion** between Buddhists did not disappear. The adepts of the Śrāvakayāna criticised the new Mahāyāna discourses, and the adepts of Mahāyāna tried to answer **these**
criticisms.408 Words of the Buddha which had so far been taken literally **were**
subjected to new interpretations: the texts which corresponded to one's own doctrine were taken literally, all the others as needing interpretation.409 One question could not be circumvented: Why did the Buddha **bother** to express himself in words that need interpretation and cannot be taken at their **face** value? To answer this question, the Buddhists made use of the concept of **"skill** in means" (upāyakauś*alya*).410 Skill in means was soon recognised by Mahāyāna as one of the perfections (pā*ramit*ā) which a Bodhisattva must seek to attain, and which a Buddha possesses. Through skill in means, a Buddha encourages **people** to seek enlightenment. And different people need different means. A **well-known**
parable from the Lotus Sūtra tells of a rich man who owns a big house which has one single door.411 One day, while this rich man's children are playing with **their**
toys inside, the house catches fire. When their father calls them, the children do not come out. Now the father uses skill in means if, on the basis of his **knowledge** of his children's tastes, he entices them to leave the house with the **promise** of particularly enchanting toys. In reality, he does not have these toys, but he **gives** them something much more valuable. The aim is to save the **children.** It is noteworthy that the father promises his children different types of carts, but **that** in the end he gives them all big carts, big vehicles (mahāyāna). The comparison **with**
the three Vehicles (yāna) of Buddhism is clear. In this comparison, Mahāyāna is represented as the best, or even as the only Vehicle.412 

## 2. Influences Outside Buddhism

We have seen that Indian Buddhism cannot be rightly understood without **taking** into account non-Buddhist religious and intellectual currents. This is true for the early development of Buddhism, which was strongly influenced by Jainism and related movements, as well as by the idea that knowledge of the self was **essential** to attain liberation. Later on, the Sarvāstivāda school may have been **influenced** in a decisive manner by the Greek culture prevalent in north-west India, **especially** by its tradition of debate. In the further developments of Indian Buddhism, **too,** it is important to take its interactions with other movements into account. We **shall** do so in this **section.**
Buddhism was not always merely at the receiving end in this **exchange** of ideas and practices. With the constant growth of its importance in India, **Buddhism** itself started to exert an influence on other movements. In the course of the centuries, this happened in various fields. Sometimes it directly **concerned** Buddhist doctrine and praxis. Influences in other fields, such as the arts and literature, cannot be dealt with here. Let it suffice to state that Buddhism left its mark on the most important Brahmanical philosophies, as well as on the **practice** of yoga. Attempts to prove that Buddhism was already known to late Vedic **literature**
are not always convincing.413 The Sarvāstivāda tendency to systematise found resonance within as **well** as outside Buddhism. Indeed, several thinkers tackled the question as to how to use the Sarvāstivādins' method without adopting the details of their doctrine.414 **This**
means that they tried to develop alternative doctrines that were **systematically** thought through. Others thought that the Sarvāstivādins' rationality only led to absurdities, and that one should turn away from it, or point out its **absurdity.** In these cases we are dealing with reactions to the doctrine, or rather the **method,** of the Sarvāstivādins. Thirdly, there were thinkers who simply borrowed their **ideas.**
We find some early traces of Buddhist influence in the Mahābhā*rata*.

415 One of its verses declares - with respect to the manifested (*vyakta*) of Sāṃkhya - **that,**
being connected with the four characteristics (lakṣaṇa), it is born, grows, **becomes**
old, and dies. The unmanifested (*avyakta*) is without them.416 Both from the **point** of view of terminology and content, this may be compared with the Sarvāstivā**dins'**
four characteristics of the conditioned (saṃskṛ*talak*ṣaṇa). The necessity to know all the names of the unmanifested in order to reach liberation may be an **epic** reformulation of the Buddhist conviction that one cannot put an end to **suffering** as long as there remains even a single dharma which is not known and **correctly**
understood.417 The Mahābhā*rata* also knows the expression **avipra**ṇāśa 'nondestruction' in connection with the theory of karma. **Avipra**ṇāśa was **sometimes**
used in Buddhism as a synonym of *avijñapti* 'non-information'.418 A clearer but **still**
implicit reference to Buddhism is found in the Śā*ntiparvan* of the Mahābhā*rata* where it speaks of a fourfold dhyā*nayoga*. This recalls the Four **Stages** of Meditation (dhyāna) of Buddhism. And indeed, the goal which must be **reached** is called Nirvāṇa, also in this passage of the Mahābhā*rata*. The first **stage** of meditation (the only one described) contains reflection (vicāra) and **deliberation**
(*vitarka*), as well as joy (*sukha*), exactly as in Buddhism.419 The earliest trace of borrowing of a Buddhist idea by a non-Buddhist may perhaps be found in the Mahābhāṣya, Patañjali's "Great Commentary". **This** is a commentary on Pāṇini's famous grammar, and belongs to the **Brahmanical** tradition. As such, it has nothing to do with Buddhism, and accordingly it does not even mention that religion. The Mahābhāṣya was probably composed in **north-west**
India.420 As we know, this is also the region where the Sarvāstivādins had settled.421 There are several reasons to believe that Patañjali underwent the **influence**
of Buddhism, which we considered in chapter 3. The Sarvāstivādins, as we **have** seen, introduced some linguistic dharmas in the context of their **systematisation**
called Pañcavastuka. These are: the body-of-word (nāmakāya), the body-ofsentence (*padak*āya), and the body-of-sound (*vyañjanak*āya). The Sarvāstivā**dins'**
ontological preoccupations induced them to accept these dharmas in their **system.**
These dharmas, like all the other conditioned (saṃskṛta) dharmas, **were**
momentary. 

Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya does not share the Sarvāstivādins' **interest** in ontological matters. Rather, the aim of his work is to discuss problems **relating** to Pāṇini's grammar, and, whenever possible, to solve them. Thus Patañjali **continues,** and enlarges upon, Pāṇini's work. Nevertheless, we find considerable **differences** between these two thinkers. One such difference concerns the question which **parts** of language are the real conveyers of meaning. According to Pāṇini, this **role** is fulfilled by nominal stems, verbal roots and suffixes, i.e., by the **grammatical** components of words. Only a small step is needed to conclude from this that the meanings attached to words and sentences are secondary, and are deduced from the primary meanings which belong to their parts. These ideas fit in with **what** we know about the linguistic ideas of those days. It is therefore all the more **surprising**
to see that Patañjali defends the opposite view that *words* are the real **conveyers** of meaning. According to him, the meanings of nominal stems, verbal roots and suffixes are secondary, and can only be deduced from the meanings of **words.**
This difference between Pāṇini and Patañjali is fundamental, and **requires** an explanation. Furthermore, as we have remarked above, ontological **questions** played no role with the grammarians. This is also true of Patañjali's **disquisitions.**
However, there are some passages in his Mahābhāṣya which reveal that for him sounds and words are really existing things which, moreover, are eternal. Here **too,** a question arises: how do we explain Patañjali's ontological **interest?**
Both these problems can easily be solved if we suppose that Patañjali was directly or indirectly influenced by the Sarvāstivādins. For the latters' **linguistic**
dharmas concern sounds and words,422 whereas nominal stems, verbal roots and suffixes hold no interest for them. Furthermore, ontological problems are **central** to Sarvāstivāda. The fact that the Sarvāstivādins' linguistic dharmas are **momentary,** whereas Patañjali's sounds and words are eternal, is not very significant: **according** to the Buddhists, virtually everything is momentary, and Patañjali was not in the least bound to share the Buddhists' doctrine of momentariness, even if he **borrowed**
some of their ideas.423 Patañjali's ontological reflections are the starting **point** of a development in Indian philosophy which became known as the sphoṭa-theory. Its central concepts are quite similar to the Buddhist body-of-word (nāmakāya), bodyof-sentence (*padak*āya), and body-of-sound (*vyañjanak*āya). In other words, the sphoṭa-theory drew its ultimate inspiration from Sarvāstivāda. 

There are further indications which strengthen the supposition that **Patañjali**
was directly or indirectly acquainted with the doctrines and texts of the Sarvāstivādins. They cannot be dealt with at present.424 If Patañjali was **indeed**
influenced by the Sarvāstivādins (and there is no reason to doubt this), it is **possible** to establish the date of their systematising activities. For their linguistic **dharmas** are part of the Pañcavastuka, without which they would have no place in the dharma theory. It is therefore likely that the Pañcavastuka had already **been** invented at the time of Patañjali. Patañjali's date is known. He wrote in the **middle**
of the second century BCE.425 Accordingly, the Pañcavastuka must have **existed** as early as the second century **BCE.** 
In the case of the Brahmanical system called Vaiśeṣika, too, **Buddhist**
influence must be postulated. The oldest texts of Vaiśeṣika do not **mention** Buddhism. Any conclusions as to Buddhist influence can therefore only be **reached**
on the basis of deep similarities. Such similarities exist.426 In order to **understand**
this, recall the following. First, the Sarvāstivādins, and many other Buddhists **with** them, claimed to present an exhaustive enumeration of everything that exists in the world. This inventory existed in the form of a list of dharmas. The dharmas **being** all that exists, their exhaustive enumeration is an enumeration of everything **that** exists. Closely connected with this first claim, their second claim is that **composite** things do not really exist. This could hardly be otherwise, for composite things are no dharmas. A third point concerns the relationship between language and **what** is believed to be reality: the chariot does not exist, but the word *chariot* is used **when**
the constituent parts of a chariot are assembled. In this way, language explains how we believe that composite objects exist at **all.** 
These three points characterised the thought of many Buddhists in **those**
days. Momentariness and the doctrine of atoms should be added to these. We **have** seen that the Sarvāstivādins took great pains to systematise their thought and elaborate these last two **positions.**
All of the points here mentioned recur in Vaiśeṣika. Its main **characteristic** is certainly its advanced rationality, which at times does not hesitate to adopt **risky** doctrinal positions if internal consistency demands it. As explained above, **this** rational attitude appeared perhaps for the first time in India in Sarvā**stiv**āda thought. It is possible that the Vaiśeṣika borrowed it directly or indirectly from **that** school. 

Let us now examine more closely the above-mentioned points. The Buddhists had an exhaustive enumeration of everything that exists. The Vaiśeṣ**ikas**
established one, too.427 Their list had to be different from the Buddhist **list** of dharmas, because the Vaiśeṣikas did not agree with the Buddhists' second **point.** According to the latter, there are no composite things; the Vaiśeṣikas claimed the opposite: composite things exist, and are not identical with their component **parts.** A pot, for example, really exists and is different from its two halves. This **opinion** made it impossible to agree with the Buddhists' third point. According to the Buddhists, our false belief in the existence of composite things is caused by the words of language. The Vaiśeṣikas turned this round, and assumed that *reality itself* is conditioned by language, i.e., that it corresponds to language. This also **means** that it is possible to draw conclusions about reality from linguistic **data.** 
The doctrine of atoms is an essential part of Vaiśeṣika. Their atoms had no spatial extension. This was the position accepted by the Sarvāstivādins, too. The Vaiśeṣikas also have a doctrine of momentariness, which is visible in **their** treatment of mental events. The Vaiśeṣikas likewise considered it impossible for two mental events to take place simultaneously in one and the the same **person.** Also the Sarvāstivādins held this belief; it was adopted by other **Buddhists.**
A detailed description of the non-Buddhist Vaiśeṣika system in a book **about**
Buddhist teaching would not be appropriate. The above indications must **suffice,** and readers interested in Vaiśeṣika are referred to the relevant literature for **further**
details.428 Note however how closely the Vaiśeṣika system resembles the **Buddhist**
system, despite many differences. This similarity allows us to understand Vaiśeṣika as a reaction against Buddhism, and more precisely, against the Sarvā**stiv**āda system of thought. The subsequent development of Vaiśeṣika, now combined **with**
the school of Nyāya, is characterized by further interaction with Buddhism.429 Regarding Nāgārjuna's influence outside the sphere of Buddhism, the situation is not very clear and has not been sufficiently studied so far. **Nevertheless,** we can make the following observations. Sarvāstivāda, as we noted earlier, was immune to Nāgārjuna's main attacks, because, according to the doctrine which had given it its name, objects already exist before they come into being. A **similar** doctrine is found in the Brahmanical system called Sāṃkhya. It became **known**
under the name "doctrine of the effect (kārya) already existing (sat) in the **cause"** (satkā*ryav*āda). This doctrine appeared relatively late: we meet it for the first **time**
in Āryadeva, who was perhaps Nāgārjuna's younger contemporary. **Moreover,** it does not seem to fit the oldest form of Sāṃkhya that we know of.430 It is **therefore**
justified to wonder "whether satkārya itself was not perhaps only an **aspect** of a discussion with Mādhyamika Buddhists."431 It may not be possible to prove **this.** It is possible that both Nāgārjuna and the Sāṃkhya system reacted to a **problem** which existed already before Nāgārjuna. It is however most likely that this **problem** - resting as it does on the hypothesis that words and things are closely **correlated** - ultimately had a Buddhist **origin.**
The preoccupation with this set of problems during an important part of the first millennium can be traced in the writings of all Brahmanical **systems** of thought, and even in Jainism. It is not possible to present the different **positions** in detail. But these discussions had a profound, sometimes decisive, influence on the classical shapes of the Brahmanical schools.432 From the time of Nāgārjuna onward, texts belonging to various **systems** of thought began to discuss the opinions of others. Their main aim was to defend **their** own positions, and to show that the opponents' views are incorrect. But the unavoidable side-effect of such discussions was that the schools **increasingly** influenced each other. A good example is the development of logic, which **came** into existence as a result of the constant exchange of ideas, mainly **between** Buddhist and Brahmanical thinkers. The Buddhists' contribution to **this** development was important and decisive. It cannot be discussed here, because **this** development is rather far removed from Buddhist teaching in a strict **sense.** 
The influence of Mahāyāna Buddhism on the Vedānta **philosophy** –
especially on Advaita Vedānta - is interesting. Vedānta philosophy is **primarily** based on the Vedic Upanishads. Indeed, the term Vedānta means "end of the **Veda"** and designates the Upanishads. However, the relevant Upanishads were **composed** before the Common Era, whereas Vedānta philosophy became important only **late** - later than most of the other principal Indian **philosophies.** 
The thinker Bhartṛhari may have considered himself to be a Vedāntin. In his major work, the Vā*kyapad*īya, he quotes at one point the opinion of the trayyantavedin "the knowers of the end of the triple [knowledge]", i.e., **"the**
knowers of the Upanishads", and there are indications that he may **perhaps** be quoting his own opinion.433 Bhartṛhari's thought betrays in many ways the influence of Buddhism. Like the Buddhists, he starts with the premise that **there** is a close correspondence between words and things. He goes so far as to claim that the mere existence of the words "heaven" and "god" allows us to conclude that **heaven**
and god exist.434 Like the Buddhists, Bhartṛhari believed that the phenomenal **world**
ultimately does not exist. More precisely, he believed that everything has a real and an unreal side. The real side of things is identical with the highest reality, the totality of all that exists. This highest reality is divided, by the words of **language,** into the things that make up the phenomenal world. Here Bhartṛhari diverges **from** Buddhist thinking, which does not accept that any composite things really **exist.**
But the role of language is comparable. In both cases, *words* give to the **objects** of the phenomenal world a semblance of **reality.** 
The Āgamaśā*stra*, attributed to a certain Gauḍapāda, belongs to the **oldest**
texts of Advaita Vedānta. The influence of Mahāyāna is very clear in this case. The fourth chapter of this work, for example, was written either by a **Buddhist** or by a Vedāntin who was strongly influenced by Buddhism.435 One point of doctrine of the Āgamaśā*stra* is the thesis of the non-production of the phenomenal **world.** It is practically certain that it was borrowed from **Buddhism.** 
It is not yet clear to what extent the great Śaṅkara was **influenced** by Buddhism.436 Other Vedāntins levelled this accusation against him. Rāmā**nuja** called him a crypto-Buddhist.437 Śaṅkara's connection with 'Gauḍapāda' is emphasised by tradition and confirmed by a commentary on the Āgamaśā*stra* **that**
was perhaps composed by him. Since Śaṅkara is very critical of **Buddhism,** it is unlikely that he borrowed much from it directly. But an indirect **influence** - through 'Gauḍapāda' or other authors - cannot be ruled **out.** 
We have already discussed some verses of the Mahābhā*rata* which **betray**
Buddhist influence on yoga. Buddhist influence on the more recent form of **yoga**
which we call *classical yoga* was recognised long ago by modern scholarship.438 Recall that the oldest form of yoga consisted of ascetic practices which put **great** emphasis on physical and mental immobility. These practices constituted a **path** classical yoga influenced Buddhism at an early date. Conversely, by accepting and adapting certain ideas and practices from Buddhism, pre-classical yoga was **able** to develop its classical form, embodied in the Yoga Sūtra and the *Yoga Bh*āṣya.

439 In this process, Buddhism contributed the following. Pre-classical, non-Buddhist **yoga** aimed at physical and mental immobility. The Buddhists had borrowed this **interest** in immobility - especially mental immobility - quite early in their history, but **they** did not believe that it was sufficient for reaching the highest goal. There was the additional requirement to destroy certain mental impurities; the texts speak of **taints**
(ā*srava*), but also of attachments (anuśaya), impressions (vāsanā), **seeds** (bīja), or intentions (āśaya), and sometimes of conditioned factors (saṃskāra). **This**
requirement found a place in the Yoga Sūtra, and all the above-mentioned **terms,**
with the exception of ā*srava*, are used in that text.440 Concretely, this means **that**
under the influence of Buddhism, yoga no longer exclusively sought to suppress the mind, but also - and this was new - that it sought to attain a lasting **transformation** of the mind by destroying these volitional **processes.**
Apart from this essential contribution of Buddhism to classical yoga, the Yoga Sūtra contains other parallels to Buddhist practice and theory. Among **them,**
the four concentrations in YS 1.17 - which, from the points of view of content and terminology, can be shown to be parallels of the Buddhist Four **Stages** of Meditation (dhyāna) –, the Four Unmeasurables (*apram*āṇa) (YS 1.33), and the Five Faculties (*indriya*) or Five Strengths (*bala*) (YS 1.20). All of these **were**
borrowed from **Buddhism.** 

## 3. Landmarks

To conclude, we shall briefly discuss a few particularly important landmarks in the development of Indian **Buddhism.**
Buddhism originated within the so-called Śramaṇa movement.441 It **shared**
various characteristics with other currents belonging to this movement, **especially** the belief in the cycle of rebirths conditioned by actions, and the search for liberation. But Buddhism occupied a *special position* within this movement. Its understanding of what constitute actions, as well as the method it preached, are different from the actions and methods accepted by those other currents. The connection between method and liberation from the cycle of rebirths, in **particular,** was less obvious in Buddhism than it was in the other currents. As a result, the Buddhists were, practically from the beginning, searching for the correct **method,** and could sometimes not resist the attraction of the methods propounded by **their** competitors. 

Then there is the role played by the doctrine of *non-self* in **Buddhism.**
Initially it implied no more than the denial of insight into the true nature of the **self** as an essential element of the road leading to liberation. The idea of **non-self** subsequently developed into one of the fundamental dogmas of Buddhism. It **gave** rise to the doctrine of the non-existence of composite things. The **ultimate** constituent elements, the dharmas, became in this way the only things that **really** exist, and the dharma theory developed into an ontology. Subsequently a **further** step was taken, and the existence of the dharmas themselves came to be denied; **this** time, too, a justification could readily be found in the doctrine of **non-self.**
The belief in the non-existence of composite things gave rise to **reflections**
on the relationship between *words and things*. Our everyday conviction **that**
composite things, including ourselves, really exist, can be explained by **linguistic** usage. A chariot does not really exist, it is nothing but a word. Nāgārjuna **went** a step further, including also propositions in these reflections. This allowed him not only to assert, but to prove that phenomenal reality does not really **exist.** 
This last development could take place because something new had **become**
part of Buddhism, viz., a tradition of *rationality*. This term is here used to **refer** to the readiness (and obligation) to discuss with people who think **otherwise.** It is possible that this tradition arose as a result of contacts with the Greeks who **lived** in the north-western part of the subcontinent. It soon spread throughout South **Asia,** and came to characterise the subsequent development, not only of **Buddhist** thought, but of Indian philosophy in **general.**
The last element to be mentioned is the constant interest of **Buddhist**
thinkers for *religious practice*. This does not necessarily mean that many of **them**
really practised meditation, but that ideas about such experiences often **conditioned** their conception of reality. Already in canonical times three levels of **reality** - corresponding to mental states - were distinguished within the objective **world.** Later developments - such as Yogācāra idealism - were probably inspired, at **least** in part, by similar **reflections.**
The interplay of these and other factors gave Indian Buddhism its **richness** in doctrines and ideas. These doctrines and ideas exerted a deep influence on non- Buddhists in India. It is for instance doubtful whether classical Indian **philosophy** would ever have come into existence without Buddhism. If it had, it would **have** been completely different from what it is. It is also clear that classical yoga, **which** in itself is not at all Buddhist, was strongly influenced by Buddhism (and not the other way round, as scholars sometimes claim).
