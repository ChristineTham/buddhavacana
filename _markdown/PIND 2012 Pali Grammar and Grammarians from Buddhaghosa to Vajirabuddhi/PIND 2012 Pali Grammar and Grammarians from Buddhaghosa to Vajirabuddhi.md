## I. Introduction

§1. Since the publication of R.O. Franke's study *Geschichte und Kritik der einheimischen Pāli-Grammatik und -Lexicographie (PGL)* in 1902 which constitutes the first and so far only attempt at writing an outline of the history and development of indigenous Pāli grammars, little research has been carried out in this vast and largely unexplored field.[^1] When Franke wrote his monograph he did not consider historically important grammars like Vajirabuddhi's Mukhamattadīpanī (Mmd) mainly basing his study on Kaccāyana (Kacc) and Kaccāyanavutti (Kacc-v), Rūpasiddhi (Rūp), Moggallāna (Mogg), Moggallānavutti (Mogg-v), and fragments of Saddanīti (Sadd), nor did he attempt a more thorough study of the literature he chose to focus upon. Thus the limited textual basis of Franke's study sometimes made him draw conclusions which are no longer valid. Now that all important surviving grammars have been published, there is reason to make another attempt at writing a survey of the indigenous Pāli grammars in a historical perspective : first of all, Helmer Smith has published his monumental edition of Aggavaṃsa's Saddanīti which in many ways constitutes the culmination of centuries of indigenous Pāli philology. Other historically important works like Kaccāyanasuttaniddesa (Kacc-nidd) and Moggallānapañcikā (Mogg-p) have also been published as well as a substantial number of minor grammatical works together with their commentaries.[^2] Consequently, the basis for evaluating the extant Pāli grammars has been widened considerably: it is now possible to study the statements of the Pāli grammarians in a more comprehensive historical context. This is especially important for a correct evaluation of their descriptive method: as a rule they would either formulate new rules or re-formulate the rules embodied in Kacc and Kacc-v so as to improve upon their grammatical description of the many phonological, morphological, and syntactical features of the Pāli. This was done on the basis of a comprehensive collection of examples from canonical and post-canonical literature.[^3] Thus the study of the Pāli grammars from a historical perspective is likely to shed light upon the transmission of the canonical and post-canonical literature.

§2. A substantial part of post-Kaccāyana grammatical literature is no longer extant. Thus we are only informed about important works through grammars like Mmd (see IV.3.1), Rūp, Rūp-ṭ, Mogg, Mogg-p, and Sadd which occasionally quote or discuss statements found in Mahānirutti (Mahā-nir) (see IV.2.2), Niruttipiṭaka (Nir-piṭ) (see IV.2.4),
Cūḷanirutti (Cūḷ-nir) (see IV.2.5), Mañjūsā (Mañj) (see IV.2.6), Saṅgaha
(Sgh) (see IV.2.7), Mahāsandhippakaraṇa (Mahā-s) (see IV.2.8), Cūḷasandhi (Cūḷ-s) (see IV.6.9), etc. Without these references it would have been impossible to form an idea of the history and development of Pāli grammar. Direct as well as indirect evidence indicates that these works have exerted a great influence on subsequent Pāli grammarians. Thus, for instance, Mañj affected the description of the *kāraka* system in Rūp, which in turn was used by Aggavaṃsa who copied verbatim several of the relevant paragraphs from Rūp.[^4] In those circumstances - there are many other examples - it is clear that the Pāli grammars have to be studied from a historical perspective, otherwise the context of certain of their statements or discussions remains incomprehensible.

§3. In addition to main works like Kacc, Kacc-v, Mmd, Rūp, Mogg, and Sadd, Pāli grammarians mention or quote many other treatises. Thus, for instance, Kaccāyanasuttaniddesa (Kacc-nidd) - no doubt the most important source of information on grammatical literature in the fifteenth century A.D. - quotes as many as twenty-five grammatical treatises in addition to well-known works like Nyāsa (= Mmd), Rūp, Sadd, and Mogg: 1. Akkharapadamañjūsā,[^5] 2. Akkharasamūha,[^6] 3. Aṭṭhakathāatthadīpanī,[^7] 4. Atthajotaka,[^8] 5. Atthavinicchayavaṇṇanā,[^9] 6. Atthavyākhyāna,^[10] 7. Atthavaṇṇanā,[^11] 8. Kaccāyananissayappakaraṇa,[^12] 9. Kārikā,[^13] 10. Ṭīkāvyākhyā,[^14] 11. Therapotthaka,[^15] 12. (Mahā)-Nirutti,[^16] 13. Niruttijotaka,[^17] 14. Niruttijotakavaṅṇṇanā,[^18] 15. Niruttibījâkhyāna (= Bījâkhyāna ?),[^19] 16. Nyāsaṭīkā,[^20] 17. Nyāsapadīpaṭīkā,[^21] 18. Nyāsappadīpappakaraṇa,[^22] 19. Bālâvatāra,[^23] 20. Bījâkhyā,[^24] 21. Bījâkhyāna,[^25] 22. Bhassakārī,[^26] 23. Mañjūsāṭīkā,[^27] 24. Mukhamattasāra,[^28] and 25. Saṅgahakāra.[^29]

[^5]: See Kacc-nidd 202,14–17: *Akkharapadamañjūsāyañ ca*\
*ekâkhyāto padacayo siyā vākyaṃ sakārako*\

*bhaye kodhe pasaṃsāyaṃ turite kotūhalacchare*\
*hāse soke pasāde ca kare āmeṇḍitaṃ budho*\
*ti vuttaṃ*; the second verse is quoted by Buddhaghosa from an unknown source in his cts.; see Pind 1989: 74–75; if the verse is part of the original work and not just quoted from the Aṭṭhakathās, the Akkharapadamañjūsā must antedate Buddhaghosa ; perhaps it is an old Pāli kośa.

[^7]: See Kacc-nidd 126,17 ; the subject matter of this work appears to be the case system of Pāli; it is related to the Saṅgaha (see IV.2.7); Kaccāyanasāraṭīkā mentions it together with Mmd (*paramatthavinicchayo pana Aṭṭhakathādīpanīto Nyāsato ca gahetabbo*, 48,9–10) immediately after having quoted the relevant verses from Mañj (for which, see § 93) as a work dealing with the question of *paramatthavinicchaya*, presumably in the light of Mañj and the Pāli Aṭṭhakathās which occasionally quote verses defining the nature of the Two Truths, on which, see O.H.

§4. Among these grammatical treatises, Gandhavaṃsa only mentions Atthavyākhyāna by Cūḷavajira and Mukhamattasāra by Guṇasāgara.[^30] However, the Pagan Inscription from 1442[^31] A.D. mentions not only Atthavyākhyāna,[^32] Kaccāyananissaya,[^33] Bālâvatāra,[^34] Bījâkhyā,[^35] and Mukhamattasāra,[^36] but also other important Pāli and Sanskrit grammars.[^37] Especially Atthavyākhyāna must have been an important work, because Chapaṭa either quotes from, or refers to it twenty-eight times in Kacc-nidd. Particular interest is also attached to Bījâkhyā, from which Kacc-nidd cites a verse, which has been interpolated in Kacc-v (see §64).

§5. Faced with this overwhelming number of works and the regrettable fact that virtually no research has been carried out in this vast field, it is obvious that a selection has to be made in the context of a brief survey. Since there is no hope of understanding the history and development of Pāli grammar without knowledge of the works that in one way or another shaped the tradition, it seems justified in the present case to focus primarily, although briefly, on those works that belong to the formative period of Pāli grammar, that is to say, the period that stretches from the time of composition of Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathās through the complicated history of Kacc and Kacc-v to the completion of Vajirabuddhi's Mmd, presumably in the tenth century A.D. The treatment is not intended to be exhaustive.[^38] The main purpose has been to shed light upon important aspects of the early history and development of indigenous Pāli grammars.

## II. Grammar In The Pāli Aṭṭhakathās

### II.1. Grammatical Terminology of the Aṭṭhakathās

§6. Buddhaghosa (fifth century A.D.) occasionally focuses on points of grammar in Visuddhimagga and the Aṭṭhakathās in order to explain a syntactical problem, a particular construction, or the derivation of a particular word or the like. The interesting thing about these grammatical analyses is that certain of the technical terms Buddhaghosa uses are without parallel in Sanskrit grammar. It is possible to show, however, that in substance the analyses found in Visuddhimagga and the Aṭṭhakathās presuppose Pāṇinian grammar. Consequently there is no reason to assume with R.O. Franke[^39] that these terms constitute the vocabulary of an old Pāli grammatical system used by the compiler(s) of the Aṭṭhakathās.[^40] In fact, the rudimentary character of the vocabulary would seem to indicate that it was established for exegetical purposes, its nature being dictated by its relevance for the canonical exegesis and the wish to use a distinct Pāli terminology for this purpose, rather than with the intention of establishing a comprehensive Pāli grammatical system.

[^39]: See *PGL*: 2; 20.

[^40]: See Pind 1989 : 33*ff*.

§7. The grammatical vocabulary that is specific to the Aṭṭhakathās is limited to (a) a peculiar phonological terminology, (b) a remarkable case terminology, (c) a term denoting the syntactical category of adverb, (d)
terms denoting the four parts of speech, (e.a, e.b) two sets of terms defining four types of nominals, and (f) terms denoting words, sentences, and syllables.

(a) Certain of the phonological terms differ from Sanskrit terminology. They occur in a verse which is quoted and commented on at Sp 1399,19*ff*. [^41] where the question of correct articulation of the Pāli is discussed in the context of the *kammavācā*. Among the individual technical terms *sithila* "unaspirated", *dhanita* "aspirated", *niggahīta* "nasalized", and *vimutta* "oral", are without parallel in Sanskrit terminology ;
dīrgharassa "long and short", *garuka* "heavy" and *lahuka* "short", however, are common to Pāli and Sanskrit grammar, whereas *sambaddha*
"bound together" and *vavatthitaṃ* "separated" merely relate to the connected or disjoint articulation of the words in a sentence. The term *niggahīta*, which denotes a nasalized vowel articulated by checking the organs of articulation (*karaṇāni*) and without opening the mouth (*avivaṭena mukhena*), has been adopted by Kacc and post-Kaccāyana grammarians as a technical term equivalent to Sanskrit *anusvāra.* The grammarians, however, differ in their interpretation of *niggahīta*.
Vajirabuddhi, the author of Mmd, interprets the term as *(saraṃ) nissāya gayhati*, i.e., grasped by means of a vowel.[^42] Buddhappiya propounds the same view, but in addition he reproduces the definition of the Aṭṭhakathā, quoting a verse at Rūp 10[^43] which defines *niggahīta* in such a way as to suggest that it is a versification of the definition at Sp. In contrast to Vajirabuddhi he also refers to sithila, *dhvanita* and the other terms at Rūp 1 (= Kacc 1),[^44] thus evidently interpreting the remarks at Kacc-v 1 about *akkharavipatti*, i.e., failure to articulate the letters correctly, in terms of the *kammavācā*, which in the final analysis may have been the *raison d'être* of Kacc 1 ;[^45] moreover, he uses *sithila* and dhanita at Rūp 11.[^46] Aggavaṃsa appears to be the first Pāli grammarian who has integrated all the terms into his grammar.[^47]

[^41]: *sithilaṃ dhanitaṃ ca dīgharassaṃ* | *garukaṃ lahukañ ca niggahītaṃ* | *ambaddhaṃ vavatthitaṃ vimuttaṃ* | *dasadhā vyañjanabuddhiyā pabhedo ti* (= Sv 177,1–4 = Mp II 289,17–20). For a study of this interesting passage, see von Hinüber, 1987.

[^42]: See Mmd 17,3.

[^43]: See Rūp 4,26–27:\
*karaṇaṃ niggahetvāna mukhenâvivaṭena yaṃ.* |\
*vuccate niggahītan ti vuttaṃ bindu sarânugaṃ* ||\
Quoted Mogg-p 9,22–23 ; cf. Sp 1399,30–32 : *niggahītan ti yaṃ karaṇāni niggahetvā avissjjetvā avivaṭena mukhena anunāsikaṃ katvā vattabbaṃ.*

[^44]: See Rūp 1,12: *sithiladhanitâdiakkharavipattiyaṃ hi atthassa dunnayatā hoti.*

[^45]: Kacc-nidd 8,5*ff*. quotes three verses that connect the articulation of *niggahīta* with *kammavācā* and *ñatti*:\
*padamajjhe padante vā patiṭṭhitaṃ anussāraṃ*\
*ñattiyaṃ kammavācā*yaṃ bhaṇe niggahītantaṃ vā*\
*dutiyādo makārantaṃ upajjhaggahaṇâdisu*\
*vaggantaṃ niggahītan ti yathāraham udīraye*\
*saraṇagamanadāne niggahītaṃ makārantaṃ*\
*avaggesu ṅakārassa ṅâdayo n' atthi sāsane.*

[^46]: Rūp 5,5: *ettha ca vaggānaṃ dutiyacatutthā dhanitā ti pi vuccanti, itare sithilā ti.*

[^47]: See Sadd §§14–21.

(b) The Pāli Aṭṭhakathās use the following set of terms to denote the individual case forms:[^48] nom. *paccatta*, acc. *upayoga*, instr. *karaṇa*, dat. *sampadāna*, abl. *nissakka*, gen. *sāmi*, loc. *bhumma*, voc. *ālapana.* The term *ālapana* is the only one that has canonical status: it is used in the Vinaya[^49] to denote the voc., and as such it has been adopted by the grammarians since Kacc, although they also use the term *āmantaṇa* (see §70) in the same sense. As for the remaining terms they consist mainly of terms that are either innovations based upon canonical Pāli or terms derived from Sanskrit grammatical terminology. Thus the use of *paccatta* to denote the nom. is no doubt motivated by the semantics of Pāli *paccattaṃ* (Skt *pratyātmaṃ*), evoking the idea of the nom. as denoting any given thing individually, i.e., its character as such, and thus roughly corresponding to the concept of *liṅga.* The term for the abl., *nissakka*, is a verbal noun derived from *nis* + *√sak*, "to move away" - evidently coined as a counterpart to Skt *apadāna* - and is only recorded in Pāli as a grammatical term. However, the term expressing the loc., *bhumma* (n.) < Skt *bhaumya* or *bhūmya*, the case that relates to place, is recorded both as an adjective and a noun in the Pāli canon.[^50] The remaining terms are related to Sanskrit terminology: karaṇa (ts.) (cf. Pāṇ I 4:42), *sampadāna* < Skt *sampradāna* (cf. Pāṇ I 4:32); the use of *sāmī* < Skt *svāmin* to denote the gen. has a counterpart in the discussion in Mahā-bh on Pāṇ II 3:50, where the expression *svāmitva* is used of the gen. relation *rajñaḥ puruṣaḥ.* It is difficult to determine what motivated the use of the term for the acc., namely, *upayoga*, which means "use, utility" and hence "thing used" denoting what is useful from the perspective of the agent. There is no clear parallel in contemporary Sanskrit grammar.[^51] According to Aggavaṃsa (Sadd §632) the term *ubbāhana* is used in the *sāsana* to designate the partitive gen. or loc. (Skt *nirdhāraṇa*), but it has not been possible to trace it to any known Aṭṭhakathā or *ṭīkā*.

[^50]: See PED s.v.

[^51]: For the use of *upayoga* in the sense of "use, utility", see Pāṇ I 4:29 and Mahābh ad loc.; for the use of *upayoga* in late sources, see Kāśikā on Pāṇ I 4 5:1.

(c) The origin and exact meaning of the term *bhāvanapuṃsaka*,
which denotes the adverb, is obscure; the most likely suggestion is that it denotes a term in the neuter (qualifying) an action (*bhāva*), alternatively it might denote an action noun (*bhāva*) in the neuter. In the discussion at Sadd §590, Aggavaṃsa observes that it is used in the sā*sana*, i.e., the Aṭṭhakathās, etc., as the equivalent of *kiriyāvisesana* < 
Skt kriyāviṣ*eśana* denoting the adverb in Skt grammar.

(d) The Aṭṭhakathās divide the parts of speech (*padavibhāga*) into four categories, namely, nāmapada, ā*khyātapada, upasaggapada* and nipātapada. Most of them reproduce this division with minor variations in connection with the exegesis of the well-known canonical stereotype evaṃ me sutaṃ, etc. Thus Sv 26,9ff. (on D I 1,4) identifies evaṃ as a nipātapada; me, etc., as nāmapada; *paṭi* (of the pp. *paṭipanno*) as upasaggapada; and hoti as ā*khyātapada.*52 There is reason to believe that this vocabulary belongs historically with the other terms. They occur in a similar classification of the parts of speech in Mahā-bh,53 and may thus have been inspired by the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.

(e.a) This fourfold division of nominals is only found in Vism 209,29 from which it was copied verbatim at Sp 122,19ff. The four types of nominals are 1. ā*vatthika*, referring to a specific state (in the existence of an entity) (< Skt ā*vasthika*; cf. Buddhist Skt *avasth*ā), e.g. *vaccho*,
dammo, balivaddo; 2. liṅ*gika*, referring to, based upon a characteristic mark (< Skt *laiṅgika*), e.g. daṇḍī, chattī, sikhī; 3. *nemittika*, referring to, based upon an attribute (of a person) (< **naimittika*, cf. Pāli *nimitta*), 
e.g. *tevijjo, chaḷabhiñño*; 4. *adhiccasamuppanna*, spontaneous (= *yadicchika*, cf. Skt *yadcchika*) like proper nouns, e.g. *Sirivaḍḍhaka.* The origin of this terminology is not known. It only occurs in a discussion of the word *Bhagavat* and therefore probably originated in an exegetical 52For similar analyses, see Ps I 3,1ff.; Spk I 4,5ff.; Mp I 4,4ff.

53See Mahā-bh ad Pāṇ I 1:1 (Paśpāśā*hnika*): I 3,17 ; Renou, *Terminologie* : 383 s.v. ākhyāta.

context with the intention to establish a distinct Pāli vocabulary for this particular purpose. It would seem to combine features from Sanskrit sources and canonical Pāli.

(e.b) The same tendency comes through in the analogous division of names at As 390,29 quoted in Paṭis-a 306,23 ≠ Moh 110,36. The terms are 1. *sāmaññanāma*, a name given by general assent, e.g. *Mahāsammato* 
(cf. D III 93,11); 2. *guṇan*āma, a name expressing an attribute, e.g. Bhagavat; 3. *kittināma*, a name expressing honour, i.e., a proper noun given at the birth ceremony; 4. *opapātikanāma*, original name, i.e., a name that is unalterably the same in time and space : *purimakappe pi* cando etarahi pi cando yeva, As 391,13. The term *guṇan*āma is analogous to *na-imittikanāma* of the above list. However, except for the term opapātikanāma, which presumably imitates Skt *autpattika*, "original" 
- used, e.g. in Mīmāṃsā of the original relation (*sambandha*) between a word and its denotation54 - the remaining terms cannot be assigned to any known context. Although this peculiar terminology is hardly ever used, it seems to belong in the Aṭṭhakathā tradition because it is also found at Spk I 95,7–8.

(f) Sp 223,22–24 quotes a passage presumably from the Mahāaṭṭhakathā, 55 which defines a rule of conduct (*sikkhāpada*) in terms of the collection of words (nā*makāya*), sentences ( *padakāya*) and syllables 
(*vyañjanak*āya) constituting it: *vuttam pi c' etaṃ: "sikkhāpadan* (Vin III 21,16) ti yo tattha nāmakāyo, padakāyo, niruttikāyo, *vyañjanakāyo* ti". The true meaning of this terminology was clearly not understood by Sāriputta who interprets them at Sp-ṭ II 33,23–25 as synonyms of *nāma* with reference to Dhs §1306.

56 The terminology stems from Buddhist Skt literature and can be traced to Vaibhāṣika theories of language which Vasubandhu criticizes in Abhidharmakośabhāṣya.57 It is not clear why the term niruttikāya (= nā*makāya*) has been inserted in the list.58

## Ii.2. Grammatical Analysis In The Aṭṭhakathās

§8. The most interesting grammatical analyses found in the Visuddhimagga and the Aṭṭhakathās are based upon Pāṇinian grammar. Their main interest is that they identify syntactical or other features of Pāli with similar features of the Sanskrit bhāṣā described by Pāṇini in the Aṣṭâdhyāyī. In spite of the importance of these grammatical observations, the Pāli grammarians were slow at absorbing them. Only some of the exegetical remarks about certain uses of the cases were incorporated into the literature (see IV.2.7). However, as the grammatical tradition developed, some of the analyses were adopted by the tradition. Thus, for instance, Buddhaghosa's analysis of the syntactical constraints on the tense of the verb when constructed with the sentence complements atthi nāma, *kathaṃ hi n*āma, and *yatra hi nāma* are only treated by Moggallāna and Aggavaṃsa (see §13), and in both cases in a polemical context with special reference to its treatment in Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathās.

§9. Other interesting discussions were not noticed by the grammarians. 

Thus, for instance, the analysis at Sp 211,3–559 of *pitāmaha* as an adj. 

with elided *taddhita* suffix (= *petāmaha* < Skt *paitāmaha*) presupposing Pāṇ IV 3 74 + 77: *vidyāyonisaṃbandhebhyo vuñ*,
60 was never adopted by the grammarians. Nor did the analysis of the commonly used particle tena hi (= *vibhattipatirūpako nipāto*) at Sp61 find its way into the description of the Pāli particles at Rūp and Sadd.62 The sophisticated grammatical analyses, e.g. at Sp 204,25–32 and Sp 480,26–81,663 apparently also went unnoticed, as well as many other interesting grammatical observations.64
§10. Buddhaghosa's analysis at Vism 216,4ff. of a string of derivatives in ika occurring in the well-known canonical formula sv*ākkhā*to Bhagavatā dhammo sandiṭṭ*hiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko* paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī ti65 is one of the few which has left its mark on the grammatical literature. The derivation *sandiṭṭhiyā jayatī ti* sandiṭṭhiko is based upon Pāṇ IV 4:2: *tena dīvyate khanati jayati jitam*;
the alternative derivation sandiṭṭhaṃ *arahatī ti sandiṭṭhiko* is indebted to Pāṇ V 1:63: *tad arhati*; this is also the case with the derivations ehi, passa imaṃ dhamman ti evaṃ pavattaṃ *ehipassavidhiṃ arahatī ti* ehipassiko and upanayanaṃ arahatī ti opanayiko, whereas the analysis of *akālika* presupposes Pāṇ V 1:108: *prakṣṭe ṭhañ.* Of these derivations Buddhapiya and Moggallāna only quote those on *sandiṭṭhika* and ehipassika at Rūp 36066 and Mogg-v IV 29, respectively. Aggavaṃsa, on the other hand, quotes most of the analysis at Sadd §764 (≠ Kacc 352, 353).

67
§11. Moggallāna and Aggavaṃsa are also the first grammarians to have taken notice at Mogg IV 74 and Sadd §783, respectively, of the derivation of *kammaniya, kammañña.* They rely presumably on the Pāli *ṭīkā*s for their information, but the analysis itself presupposing Pāṇ IV 4 98:
tatra sā*dhu* is already found in As.68
§12. As mentioned above Buddhaghosa describes the constraints of the complements atthi nāma, kathaṃ *hi nāma*, and *yatra hi nāma* on the tense of the verb which almost invariably occurs in the Pāli in the future tense, when constructed with them. He deals with (a) *atthi nāma* + fut. 

in Sp (= Ps), and Mp, (b) *kathaṃ hi nāma* + fut. in Sp, and (c) *yatra hi* nāma + fut. in Sv, Ps, and Spk.

(a) Buddhaghosa claims in two slightly different analyses at Sp 209,13–10,1 (= Ps III 297,14ff.) and Mp III 298,18–99,369 that the complement *atthi nāma* is constructed with the future tense according to whether the meaning is that something is not likely to take place, or is not to be tolerated. The analysis presupposes Pāṇ III 3 (145+) 146: kiṃ*kilāstyartheṣu lṭ.*
(b) Buddhaghosa states at Sp 288,12–1570 that the future is used in the sense of the past in a sentence introduced by kathaṃ *hi nāma.* The analysis would seem to depend on Pāṇ III 3 143 (+ 142): vibhāṣā kathami liṅ *ca.*71 Sāriputta's commentary, however, shows that he identified the source with Pāṇ III 3 144: *kiṃvtte liṅl*ṭaṃ.

72
(c) Buddhaghosa addresses this complement twice in Sv, once each in Ps and Spk. In Sv 425,26ff.: *yatra hi nāmā ti acchariyatthe nipāto* …
anussarissatī ti idaṃ yatrā *iti nipātavasena anāgatavacana*ṃ, and Ps III 
327,16 : *yatra hi nāma vimhayatthe nipāto*, he underlines that it is the construction with the particle *yatra hi nāma* when expressing wonder that entails future tense of the verb, whereas Sv 569,15ff.: *yatrasaddayuttatt*ā (so read) *pan' etaṃ anāgatavasena vutta*ṃ (cf. Sv-pṭ II 219,20–
22) and Spk I 209,4–5 : yatrā ti nipātayogena pana anāgatavacanaṃ kataṃ, merely attribute the future to the particle *yatra.* These remarks can only allude to Pāṇ III 3 (+ 147: *yaccayatrayo*ḥ) 150: citrīkaraṇ*e ca*:
"the affixes denoted liṅ (= optative) are used in construction with *yacca* and *yatra* also when the implied sense is wonder". In these cases, the Pāli invariably substitutes the future for Skt optative, but the syntactical constraint is the same.

§13. Moggallāna defines the syntactical constraints of these constructions at Mogg VI 3: *nāme garahā-vimhayesu*: "[the future occurs]
in construction with the particle *nāma* to express reproach or wonder",
quoting in the *vutti* the relevant examples from the canon.73 It is clearly written in opposition to Buddhaghosa because in the *Pañjik*ā he criticizes him, claiming that it is only the presence of the particle nāma as such that entails future.74 Aggavaṃsa in turn criticizes Moggallāna's view in his own analysis of kathaṃ *hi nāma* at Sadd §893 on the grounds that it can be shown that nāma in itself has no restrictive force 
(*niyama*) on the tense of the verb. He thus appears to defend Buddhaghosa on linguistic grounds.75 It is notable, however, that he does not deal with the other two complements.

statement concerning Kaccāyana in explanation of his authorship.79 A 
somewhat different account is found in Kacc-nidd according to which Kacc 1: *attho akkharasaññ*āto was enunciated by the Buddha on hearing a bhikkhu mispronouncing udayabbayaṃ as *udakabaka*ṃ; 80 it is subsequently put by Kaccāyana at the beginning of his grammar. The emphasis here is on the correctness of the pronunciation of Pāli, and thus ultimately on *sandhi*, the subject matter of the first chapter.

## Iii.2. The Title Of Kacc

§15. The question of the authorship of Kacc is not the only problem surrounding the grammar; the title is also a major problem. In general the work is quoted by the grammarians as *Kaccāyana.* Vajirabuddhi claims in his discussion of the title that the grammar is called Kaccāyana (n.) because it is the work of Mahākaccāyana, but then he adds that the grammar is also called *Sandhikappa.* He explains this by referring to a line of the introductory verse of the *sandhi* chapter: vakkhā*mi … susandhikappa*ṃ: "I shall set forth … the chapter on excellent *sandhi.*" The reason is, he claims, that the title of the first chapter has been transferred to the grammar as a whole. The correctness of Vajirabuddhi's remarks is confirmed by the fact that the phrase sandhikappo niṭṭ*hito* is found at the end of mss, 81 whereas the title Kaccāyana is conspicuously absent. It is not possible to decide whether originally the introductory verse was an integral part of the *sandhi* chapter or whether it was added later on. However, Vajirabuddhi's remarks indicate that at least in the tradition they were considered to be Kaccāyana's own, otherwise it is difficult to explain why the work as a whole came to be known as *Sandhikappa.*

## Iii.3. The Date Of Kacc

§16. It is impossible to date Kacc with any degree of certainty, first of all because there is hardly any internal evidence that would give a clue as to when the work was compiled. Since the rule at Kacc 69: ā*dito ca o* stating that after ā*di o* is substituted for the locative morpheme smiṃ, only seems to apply to post-Buddhaghosa Pāli,82 this rule must have been composed at a time when this Sanskritism, 83 which is recorded in the Vin-vn, 84 had been well established, presumably in the sixth–
seventh centuries A.D. If it is true that Kacc presupposes the Kāśikā
(seventh century A.D.) (see §28) it may have been composed in the eighth century A.D. This assumption would not seem to leave sufficient time for the comprehensive commentarial literature, namely, Kacc-v, Mahā-nir, Sudatta-nir, Nir-piṭ, Cūḷ-nir, and Mañj, to develop between the eighth and the tenth–eleventh century A.D., which is the approximate date of Mmd (see §108). Since Kacc-v sometimes misinterprets Kacc 
(see §52) it is reasonable to assume that it was composed at a time when the purport of certain rules was no longer clearly understood. Moreover Kacc-v presupposes the Kāśikā and thus presumably belongs to the eighth century A.D. (see §49 below). Consequently it is more likely that the approximate date of Kacc is the seventh century A.D.

## Iii.4. Composition Of Kacc

§17. According to the account of Mmd, Kacc comprises four treatises 
(pakaraṇāni): 1. sandhippakaraṇa, 2. nāmappakaraṇa, 3. ākhyātappakaraṇa, 4. *kibbidhānappakara*ṇa, divided into twenty-three sections 
(paricchedā): five *sandhiparicched*ā, eight *nāmaparicched*ā, four ā*khyātaparicched*ā, six *kibbidhānaparicchedā.*
85 The division of the 82See CPD s.v. ādo.

83See von Hinüber, 1986, §327.

84See CPD s.v. ādo.

85Mmd 5,22–24.

standard text differs slightly: it consists of four main chapters (kappa = 
pakaraṇa), some of which are subdivided into sections and subchapters. Thus the *nāmakappa* is divided into five sections (kaṇḍa) and three sub-chapters: kā*rakakappa, samāsakappa*, and *taddhitakappa.*86 This is also the case with the chapter on verbal derivatives, the kibbidhānakappa, of which the final section is called *uṇādikappa.* Mmd apparently presupposes the same division.87 We must assume that this division reflects the history of transmission of Kacc. At the time when Dhammasenāpati composed his Kārikā it was customary to divide Kacc into eight chapters as appears from Kārikā 49: sandhināmañ ca kārakaṃ, samā*sataddhitâkhyātakitakañ ca uṅādikaṃ.*
§18. Assuming that the verse introducing the first chapter of Kacc is an integral part of it, the grammar as a whole is marked by a conspicuous lack of compositional coherence. Thus the second chapter (nā*makappa*)
has no introductory verse. This contrasts with chapters three (ākhyā*takappa*) and four (kibbidhā*nakappa*), which are introduced by verses in different metres in the standard version of Kacc. Of these verses, Vajirabuddhi only knows those introducing chapter four: the prefatory verses of chapter three have been added later on.88 Unlike the other chapters, chapter three concludes with a verse in which the anonymous writer asks the learned readers to judge his attempt at making a short exposition of the verb for the sake of the (Buddha's) teaching; 89 the verse is quoted and explained in Mmd.90 Such haphazard composition would indicate that Kacc is a compilation by various hands.91

## Iii.5. The Number Of Suttas Of Kacc

§19. There is considerable uncertainty about the actual number of suttas constituting Kacc. Vajirabuddhi claims that Kacc consists of 710 suttas:
suttāni … *dasâdhikāni sattasatāni honti*.

92 He quotes and explains 708, of which he considers 34 to be interpolations. According to this account, 674 suttas are supposedly genuine. He relates that "stupid persons93 whose minds are confused by abridgements have interpolated some suttas here from Sudattakisivanirutti (see IV.2.3) and Mahānirutti (see IV.2.2), thinking that this sutta (i.e. Kacc 317) is deficient". And he adds that "they do not appear in an absolutely clean copy of the original book".94 In the light of this information it is somewhat surprising that he incorporates interpolations in his account. Thirty-three suttas are interpolated in the *kāraka* section: three between Kacc 285 and 286, 287 and 288, and 301 and 302; twenty-nine between Kacc 317 and 318; one between Kacc 320 and 321 (see §68). Vajirabuddhi also considers Kacc 245 to be an interpolation.95
§20. The standard text of Kacc upon which Kacc-v comments comprises 675 suttas in the Sinhalese and Siamese versions, and 673 in the Burmese version which omits Kacc 244–45 from the nā*makappa*.

96 This 90Mmd 407,18–19.

91It is, of course, possible that the verses were added later on; but in that case it is difficult to understand why it was not done systematically. The unsystematic way in which they are added seems to indicate that Kacc is a compilation. 

92See Mmd 5,28–29. 93Namely, the interpolators (*suttapakkhepaka*), see e.g. Mmd 264,34, 265,10.

94Mmd 243,20–23 : evaṃ hi sūyate saṅkhepôpajanitavibbhantabuddhī*hi mandehi* ūnam idan ti maññamānehi Sudattakisivanirutti-Mahāniruttito kānici suttāni idha pakkhittānī ti. *na ca tāni suparisuddhe purimapotthake sandissantī ti.*
95See Mmd 197,38–39 : *na … eso purimapāṭho.*
96Probably influenced by Vajirabuddhi, who considers Kacc 244 to be unauthentic ; see n. 83.

deviation from the other versions is no doubt reflected in Dhammasenāpati's account according to which there are 51 suttas in the *sandhi* chap., 218 in the nāma chap., 35 in the kā*raka* chap., 28 in the samāsa chap., 62 in the *taddhita* chap., 118 in the ā*khyāta* chap., 100 in the kit chap., and 50 in the uṇādi chap.,
97 in all 672 suttas. Three suttas are missing from the nā*makappa*, which comprises 221 suttas in the Sinhalese version. No doubt Kacc 244–45 had already been omitted in those days, presumably on the basis of Vajirabuddhi's remark about Kacc 244. We are left to speculate, however, about the identity of the third missing sutta.

## Iii.6. Variant Readings Of Kacc

§21. There are hardly any recorded variants of individual suttas. The readings that Mmd presupposes differ only in a few cases from the standard text of Kacc, e.g. Kacc 356 reads: samūhatthe ka*ṇ-ṇā*. Mmd and Kacc-nidd, however, presuppose the reading samūhatthe ka*ṇ-ṇā* ca.98 Mmd and the Burmese version omit ca at Kacc 436. Rūp, on the other hand, reads ca.

99 In fact, the often illogical use of the conjunction ca is a major problem for the interpretation of Kacc. One cannot exclude the possibility that some of the problems arise from a badly transmitted version of the original. In the case of Kacc 501 the original reading dāssa dajjaṃ which has survived in some manuscripts and editions100 was changed so as to conform to Kacc-v which reads an optional vā into 97Dhammasenāpati: (*suttagaṇanavinicchaya*) 50–52: sandhimhi ekapaññāsaṃ | nāmamhi dvisataṃ bhave || aṭṭhārasâdhikañ c' eva | kārake pañcatālīsaṃ || samāse aṭṭhavīsañ ca | dvāsaṭṭhi taddhite mataṃ || aṭṭhārasasatâkhyāte | kite suttasataṃ bhave | uṇâdimhi ca paññāsaṃ suttaṃ *etaṃ pakāsita*ṃ Kaccāyanena therena || 98See Mmd 313,26 : *tipadam ida*ṃ, cf. Kacc-nidd ad loc.: cā *ti samuccaye.* 99See Mmd 359,18 : *dvipadam ida*ṃ (scil. *sutta*ṃ); Kacc-nidd 218,30-32 : *katthaci* potthake "bhuja … pe … atthesu cā" ti cakārasahitam pi atthi, evaṃ sati caggahaṇenā ti iminā sameti Rūpasiddhiyaṃ cakāro atthi; Nyāse pana n' atthi.

100See Mmd 394: "dāssa dajjaṃ*" kimatthaṃ ida*ṃ (scil. *sutta*ṃ). 

the sutta: dā icc etassa dhā*tussa sabbassa dajjâdeso hoti v*ā. Both Mmd and Rūp follow this interpretation.101 Thus Buddhapiya has substituted dādhā*tussa dajjaṃ v*ā (Rūp 493) for the original reading. This was later on substituted for Kacc 501 in some manuscripts.102 Burmese and some Sinhalese manuscripts read dādhā*tussa dajja*ṃ which clearly is an edited version of Rūp 493.

103

## Iii.7. Kacc And Jinavacana

§22. The language which Kacc describes is, according to Kacc 50, Jinavacana, a term which is also used of the Buddha's sermons in Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathās, in the essay devoted to the exegesis of the canonical phrase *evaṃ me sutaṃ.*
104 Kacc does not refer to the language of the Buddha as Māgadhī. This tradition, which can be traced to Vism 441,30ff. and Vibh-a 387,24ff., is summarized by Buddhapiya in a verse in Rūp.105 However, grammarians before Buddhapiya may have used Māgadha of the language of the Buddha. Thus Śrī Rāhula quotes in Padasādhanaṭīkā two verses from Niruttisaṃvaṇṇanā (= Mañj?) stating that the Jina did not propound the Dhamma except in Māgadha.106 Moggallāna, as is well known, refers to his own grammar as Māgadhaṃ saddalakkhaṇaṃ.

## Iii.8. Kacc And Writing

§23. As appears from the description at Kacc 10: pubbaṃ *adhoṭhita*ṃ assaraṃ *sarena viyojaye*, of how to isolate words within continuously written text, Kacc presupposes the graphic practice of writing the final consonant in a conjunct below the line. Vararuci's Prāktaprakāśa107 takes the same practice for granted.

## Iii.9. Kacc And The Letters Of Pāli

§24. Kacc 2: akkharā p' âdayo ekacattāl*īsaṃ*, enumerates 41 letters of the Pāli, although the rules only make use of 40 letters: Kacc does not use the letter ḷ (< ḍ) which is represented by l, also ḷh (< ḍh) by lh.

Although most Kacc mss and editions are inconsistent as regards the representation of l/ḷ and ḷh, it is clear that Kacc did not count ḷ as a letter of Pāli, because Vajirabuddhi explicitly remarks at Mmd 10,38ff. that the author of the suttas (*suttakāra*) uses l in place of ḷ: suttakā*ro pana tassa* (scil. ḷakāra) ṭhāne lakāram eva paṭ*hati. dissati hi "yavamadanataral*ā c' âgamā" (Kacc 35), "*dahassa do la*ṃ" (Kacc 616) *iccevamādīsu.*108 It is thus possible to deduce that Kacc 2 was compiled at a time when the distinction between l and ḷ was not preserved, and later on reformulated so as to correspond with the graphic practice of a later age. In those circumstances it is something of a paradox that the editors forgot to make the necessary changes to the relevant suttas so that the work as a whole would reflect the new orthography. It is an open question when this reformulation was made, but it is apparently an established fact by the time of the composition of Kacc-v. Other Pāli grammars, like Cūḷ-nir (see IV.2.5), evidently an old commentary on Kacc, and the grammar attributed to Bodhisattamahāthera, 109 state that there are forty letters in Pāli, and thus reflect the old version of Kacc.

§25. Since the use of ḷ is no longer preserved in northern India after the fourth century A.D.,
110 whereas it is retained in southern India, it is difficult to explain why it is not used in Kacc if one assumes that it is a southern Indian or Sinhalese compilation. Since Kacc like Vararuci's Prāktaprakāśa uses l to represent the phoneme ḷ, it is possible that Kacc is not a Sinhalese or southern Indian compilation, but that it originated elsewhere.

## Iii.10. The Sanskrit Sources Of Kacc

§26. It is a well-known fact that Kacc is modelled on the Kātantra, a recast of Kaumāralāta, of which approximately 215 rules are reproduced in a more or less edited form in Kacc. In addition there are almost 300 suttas (including the overlap with Kātantra) that appear to be edited versions of Pāṇini sūtras.111 It is thus obvious that the anonymous compilator(s) of Kacc have atttempted to amalgamate Kātantra and Pāṇinian grammar. There may have been other sources. Thus one cannot exclude the possibility that Kaumāralāta, which occasionally describes Buddhist Sanskrit under the heading of ārṣe, 112 was known to the compilator(s) of Kacc. One also wonders why Kacc in a few cases 109See n. 76.

110See von Hinüber, 1986, §199.

111See the concordances in Kaccāyanavyākaraṇa, ed. and trsl., by L.N. Tiwari and B. Sharma, Varanasi 1962: 443ff.

112See H. Lüders, "Kātantra und Kaumāralāta", in Lüders, 1940, 546–61.

describes Prakritisms (see §39). Whatever the sources of Kacc may have been, the fact of the matter is that more than half the rules of Kacc are without obvious parallels in Sanskrit grammar, and in spite of occasional Sanskritisms, the grammar as a whole does not reflect Sanskrit usage and vocabulary.

§27. R.O. Franke has shown that several of the suttas that constitute the kāraka chapter presuppose Pāṇinian sūtras.113 This tendency is pervasive. There are, however, interesting examples of innovations where rules that evidently are based on Pāṇini sūtras have been reformulated so as to include instances that are not presupposed by Pāṇini, like, for example, Kacc 324: tathā *dvande pāṇi-turiya-yogga-senaṅga-khuddajantuka-vividha-viruddha-visabhāg'-atthâdīnañ ca*, which combines in one sutta Pāṇ II 4:2: dvandvaś ca prāṇitūryasenāṅgānām, 8: kṣ*udrajantava*ḥ, and 9: yesaṃ ca virodhaḥ śāś*vatikaḥ.* However, the terms yogga ("to be yoked") and *visabhāga* ("different") are commonly used Pāli words that have been adopted from Pāli literature to describe compounds that are specific to Pāli like phālapā*cana*ṃ (Sn 77), 
yuganaṅ*gala*ṃ (Sn 77), and sīlapaññ*āṇaṃ* (M II 210), *samathavipassana*ṃ (A I 157,15), and *vijjācaraṇa*ṃ (Sv 268).

114
§28. It is questionable whether Franke115 is correct in assuming that Kacc 302: gati-buddhi-bhuja-paṭha-hara-kara-sayâdīnaṃ *kārite v*ā, which combines Pāṇ I 4:52+53: gati-buddhi-pratyavasānārtha-śabdakarmākarmakānam aṇīkartā sa ṇau, h*kror anyatarasy*ām, would seem to be based upon the Kāśikā, on the grounds that Kacc follows the Kāśikā by substituting √*bhuj* and √*paṭh* and √*say* for the Pāṇinian pratyavasānārtha, ś*abdakarma*, and *akarmaka*, respectively. However, Kāś also mentions other verbs that belong to each of the three categories,116 so it remains uncertain if, in fact, Kacc presupposes Kāś. 

## Iii.11. Technical Terms Of Kacc

§29. Kacc uses a highly restricted number of technical terms. Some of them are evidently copied from the Pāli Aṭṭhakathās, like, for instance, niggahīta (see §7 (a)) which denotes a nasalized vowel, e.g. at Kacc 8, 30, 37, 82, 379, but apparently also any given nasal, e.g. at 448, 468, 539. The phonological term *viparīta* is used at Kacc 79: tabbiparīt' upapade byañjane ca, 406: tesu vuddhi-lopâgama-vikāra-viparītâdesā ca, and 519: kvaci dhātu-vibhatti-ppaccayānaṃ dī*gha-viparītâdesalopâgam*ā ca, to denote the phoneme *o < ava*, as well as *u < o.* 
According to Vajirabuddhi *vipar*īta is an old technical term for o (< 
ava)117 which Kacc 50: *o avassa* describes as a substitute for *ava.* On the other hand it is also used of u < o before conjunct consonants.118 It is perhaps borrowed from gveda *prātiśākhya* XIV.17 where it denotes the change of  into i.

§30. The case terminology is partly identical with the one used in the Aṭṭhakathās. Kacc uses *sampadāna* to denote the dative at 278, 295, and 313; and sāmī to denote the gen. at 285 and 303; ā*lapana* denotes the voc. at 57, 116, 153, and 287. However, instead of *bhumma*, Kacc uses okāsa to denote the locative at 280: yo 'dhāro ta*ṃ okāsaṃ* and 304:
okāse sattamī. This has no parallel in Sanskrit grammar and the Aṭṭhakathās and is probably an innovation. It is uncertain what might have motivated its use. It is likely, however, that it is based upon canonical usage. Thus, for instance, okāsa is used in the Vinaya, e.g. at Vin I 94,9, 119 in the sense of place which is semantically parallel to the Aṭṭhakathā term *bhumma* (see §7 (b)). The remaining case terms are related to Skt: *liṅga* denotes the nom. at Kacc 286, *kamma* the acc. at Kacc 282 and 299, *karaṇa* the instr. at Kacc 281 and 288, and apādāna the abl. at Kacc 273. §31. Kacc has coined a set of algebraic terms denoting inflectional classes of nominals: jha denotes masculine stems in i and ī (Kacc 58),
la masculine stems in u and ū (Kacc 58); pa denotes fem. stems in i, ī and u, ū (Kacc 59); gha stands for fem. stems in ā (Kacc 60), and ga denotes voc. sg. (Kacc 57).

## Iii.12. The Descriptive Technique Of Kacc

§32. As one would expect, Kacc as a whole imitates the standard descriptive technique of the Kātantra. The substitution of an item or the final element of an item is expressed by gen. (X-nom. replaces Y-gen.), 
e.g. Kacc 48: kvaci paṭ*i patissa* and Kacc 76: ā*vass' u vā.* In a few cases substituend and substituendum are simply juxtaposed in the nom., 
e.g. at Kacc 44: *abbho abhi.* Phonemic or morphophonemic changes are usually expressed by means of the acc. (X-nom. replaces Y-acc.), e.g.

Kacc 21: ivaṇṇo yaṃ *na v*ā and Kacc 220: *sesato lopaṃ ga-si pi.* In rare cases such changes are formulated by juxtaposition of the elements in question, e.g. at Kacc 470: ṭ*hā tiṭṭho.* The loc. denotes operations applying to what precedes, e.g. Kacc 24: *sare kvaci*, the abl. denotes operations that apply to what follows, e.g. Kacc 452: gahâdito ppa-ṇhā.

§33. Although Kacc uses the descriptive technique of the Kātantra, the logical ordering and formulation of the suttas cause numerous problems of interpretation. Very often a problem is caused by non-standard use of the conjunction ca or the disjunction vā. Thus, for instance, the use of ca at Kacc 20: *do dhassa ca*, is incomprehensible as the rule is without relation to Kacc 19: *sabbo can ti.* The technical use of vā is normally to express an option. However, at Kacc 13 vā is apparently used as equivalent with *kvaci* which occurs in the following rule. In fact, the two terms are apparently used interchangeably, thus making the exact scope of a rule difficult to interpret. For instance, the supposed option expressed by *na v*ā at Kacc 21: ivaṇṇ*o yaṃ na v*ā, is correctly interpreted by Rūp 21 as synonymous with *kvaci*,
120 in spite of Kacc-v which takes it as "optional", which clearly makes no sense in the context of the examples. In other cases vā appears to have no precise value at all, such as Kacc 281: yena vā kayirate taṃ karaṇaṃ, which is modelled upon Kāt II 4:12: *yena kriyate tat kara*ṇam, and 285: *yassa* vā pariggaho taṃ sāmī.

121 In the first case Kacc-v takes vā to mean 
"optionally" adding yena vā *passati* and yena vā suṇāti to *yena v*ā kayirate, but ignores the vā of Kacc 285.

§34. In some cases the suttas are inconsistent in the way they refer to the Pāli roots. For instance, √*gam* is referred to in the form *gamu* (< Skt gam, cf. Skt Dhāthup I 1013) at Kacc 503, *gami* at 478, and *gama* at 546, 588, 598; and √*dis* (< Skt dś) also occurs in the form √*dus* at Kacc 644.

## Iii.13. Kacc And The Description Of Pāli Iii.13.1. The Grammatical Rules Of Kacc

§ 35. Considering the modest scope of Kacc it is surprising how many linguistic features of Pāli it describes. The *sandhi* chapter deals with the main junctional features of the language, even a comparatively rare instance of *sandhi* like, e.g. the one described at Kacc 17: yaṃ edantass' âdeso, stating that "[in some cases] y is substituted for final e". Kacc-v illustrates this rule by quoting two canonical examples:
adhigato kho my āyaṃ *dhammo* (Vin I 4,33) and ty āhaṃ *eva*ṃ vadeyyaṃ (M I 13,1). Sometimes a rule appears to describe features that, quite apart from the fact that they are misunderstood, hardly ever occur. 

Thus Kacc 36: *kvaci o byañjane* is supposed to describe the word *atippago* at D I 178,10, which is analysed *atippag + o* + C, o being 120*navāsaddo kvacisaddapariyāyo.*
121Senart has discussed most of the cases in his edition and translation.

interpreted as ā*gama.* Kacc-v quotes *parosahassa*ṃ (sic) at S I 192,30 as another example.

§ 36. Most of the nominal and pronominal paradigms as well as the various case forms of the numerals have been dealt with in the nā*makappa*; even forms that are comparatively rare are recorded. Thus, for instance, the gen. pl. of the numeral ti viz. *tiṇṇanna*ṃ is described at Kacc 87: iṇṇaṃ iṇṇ*annaṃ tīhi saṃkhyāhi.* Only 11 canonical instances of this form have been recorded.122 It is therefore surprising that another rare canonical form like *tissanna*ṃ, fem. pl. of ti, is not described. In the chapter on verbs Kacc describes most of the inflectional classes including present stems in e at Kacc 512 (lopañ c' etta*ṃ akā*ro) and records at Kacc 501 (*dā-dhātussa dajjaṃ v*ā) and 502 (*vadassa vajja*ṃ) new present stems like *dajja* and *vajja.* A rule like Kacc 472: *ñāssa jā-janan*ā, stating that "*jā, jan*, and nā are substituted for the root ñā" is surprising. Kacc-v quotes the form nā*yati* as an example of the substitute root nā. Only two canonical examples of this form are recorded, namely, at Ja II 442,16 and Vin V 86,6.

123
§ 37. It is remarkable that Kacc describes the Vinaya technical term ā*gantuka* and its antonym *gamika* which are addressed in two consecutive rules at Kacc 571–72: ā*gamā tuko, bhabbe ika.* The interesting point is that *gamika* (secondary < *gamin + ka* ?) is defined in accordance with the semantic value it has in the Vinaya where it denotes a *bhikkhu* who intends to leave to go somewhere else.124 It is semantically related to Skt *gamin* to which Pāṇ III 3:3 (bhaviṣ*yati gamyādaya*ḥ) ascribes the same value. Although the context indicates that Kacc 572 is to be interpreted with reference to the semantical value of *gamika*, the awkward formulation of the rule avoiding any reference to the fact that ika is added to gam, perhaps indicates that it has been copied from another 122See PTC s.v.

123See the form *panāyati* at D II 21,2, 3 (= jā*nāti passati nāyati vā pavattetī ti* attho, Sv 454,6), probably an eastern form from pra + *√jñā*.

124See Abh 424 *aññattha gantum icchati gamiko*; see *BHSD* s.v.

grammar in the context of which this was made clear. A possible model would be Kaumāralāta.

III.13.2**. Rules Describing Forms That Are Not Instantiated**
§ 38. Since the grammar to a large extent describes the language of the canon, it is somewhat of a paradox that Kacc occasionally formulates rules describing forms that are not instantiated. Thus, for instance, Kacc 42 (*go sare puthass' āgamo kvaci*) states that "in some cases the final a of *putha* gets the augment g before a vowel". The vutti quotes the example *puthag eva* which is recorded neither in the canon nor in the Aṭṭhakathās. It is difficult to believe, however, that Kacc describes occurrences that are not instantiated. Rūp quotes the following example in another context: *ariyehi puthag evâyaṃ jano*,
125 which defines the term *puthujjana* in terms that are well known from Sv, although Sv uses puthu for *puthag.*126 This or similar examples may have been the raison d'être of this rule. The related rule Kacc 49: *puthass' u byañjane "u* is substituted for final a of *putha* before a consonant" evidently addresses forms like *puthujjana* = Skt p*thagjana.* Like Kacc 42 it is only understandable on the assumption that the analysis putha(g) or *puthu°* < 
Skt p*thag* was known to the anonymous author of the *sandhi* chapter. 

Instances like these leave the impression that the notion of Jinavacana covers more than just the canon. The same observation also applies to the Sanskritism ādo loc. of ādi recorded at Kacc 69. This form is not found in Buddhaghosa's Aṭṭhakathās. According to Kacc 95: *aggiss'* 
ini, ini is substituted for the final i of *aggi > aggini.* The *vutti* quotes examples that are not recorded elsewhere.

§ 39. A few rules describe Prakritisms that are not attested in the extant literature. Kacc 452: *gahâdito ppa-ṇh*ā states that "after the roots gah, etc., follow pp and ṇh", and Kacc 491: *gahassa ghe ppe* that "*ghe* is substituted for gah before pp".127 A similar rule is found in Vararuci's Prāktaprakāśa VII 58: *graher gheppaḥ.*
128 Another Prakritism is described at Kacc 503: *gamussa ghamma*ṃ (= Rūp 427 ≠ Sadd 
§ 1013)129 teaching that √*ghamm* is substituted for √*gam.*130 Kacc 392 formulates the rule that cu or co is optionally substituted for *catu* in composition. The vutti quotes as examples the forms cuddasa, *coddasa*,
catuddasa. Although the form *cuddasa* is attested in the canon (see *PTC* s.v.) there are no examples of *coddasa.* The latter, however, is common in Prakrit.131 It is uncertain how to interpret these isolated instances, but they indicate, together with the other examples, that the historical background of Kacc is extremely complicated. 

## Iii.13.3. Kacc And The Grammatical Annotations Of The Aṭṭhakathās

§ 40. Although Kacc has borrowed a couple of its case designations from the Aṭṭhakathās, there is no clear indication that the work as such is written in the tradition of the Aṭṭhakathās. On the contrary, it seems to have been written more or less independently of the commentarial literature. For instance, the peculiar sutta Kacc 20: *do dhassa ca*, "and d is substituted for dh", has apparently been composed, according to Kacc-v, with the sole intention of explaining the canonical phrase ekaṃ idâhaṃ … samayaṃ at, e.g. M I 326,6, *idâha*ṃ being analysed as *idha* + ahaṃ, although Buddhaghosa interprets *idâha*ṃ at D I 91,11 as idaṃ + 
ahaṃ, claiming that idaṃ is a mere particle (*nipātamatta*ṃ).

132 The interpretation of Kacc probably rests on a wrong identification of idā
(Vedic id; cf. EWA s.v.) with *idha* which occurs in the expression idhâhaṃ, e.g. at M I 12,30 and S III 2,14.

§ 41. The *kāraka* chapter is to a large extent indebted to Kātantra and Pāṇini, although there are suttas that are not to be explained on the basis of Kātantra, Pāṇini, Mahā-bh, or the Kāśikā. In general the description of the case system does not appear to be influenced by the annotations in the Aṭṭhakathās, although there are cases where there are parallels between Kacc and the Aṭṭhakathās. Thus for instance Kacc 292:
sattamyatthe ca, "and the instr. is used in the sense of the loc." appears to have been composed exclusively with a view of explaining canonical phrases like tena kā*lena* (Ap 38,2), *tena samayena* (Vin I 1,4), *tena kho* pana samayena (Vin I 15,1), as indicated by Kacc-v. This particular usage is commented upon by Buddhaghosa in a lengthy discussion at Sv 33,2ff., which concludes with a quotation from the old ones (porāṇā)
claiming that whether the reading is *tasmiṃ samaye, tena samayena*, or taṃ samayaṃ, the meaning is in each case locatival (*sabbattha* bhummaṃ eva attho).

133
§ 42. There is also a parallel between the annotations of the Aṭṭhakathās and the sutta at Kacc 309: *tatiyā-sattamīnañ ca*, stating that "the acc. is also used in the sense of the instr. and the loc." The vutti cites as illustrations of the instrumental usage of the acc.: *sace maṃ samaṇo* Gotamo nâlapissati, 134 *tvañ ca maṃ nâbhibhāsasi* (Ja VI 561,20), and as examples of the locatival usage : pubbaṇ*hasamayaṃ nivāsetv*ā (Vin III 
6,23), *ekaṃ samayaṃ Bhagav*ā (D I 1,4). The syntactical analysis underlying the first two examples is obscure and, quite apart from being wrong, is not supported by the Aṭṭhakathās. As in the case with the phrase *tena samayena*, Buddhaghosa comments on the Dīgha phrase at Sv 33,2ff., and he addresses the Vinaya phrase at Sp 177,8ff., where he analyses pubbaṇhasamayaṃ as *pubbaṇhasamaye*,
135 thus supporting the interpretation of Kacc and Kacc-v. However, the alternative explanation which analyses the term as *pubbaṇhe samaya*ṃ with reference to Pāṇ II 
3,5 : *kālādhvanor atyantasaṃyoge* is not treated in Kacc-v on Kacc 300:
kāladdhānaṃ *accantasaṃyoge.* There is therefore no clear indication that Kacc presupposes the grammatical observations of the Aṭṭhakathās.

§ 43. In other cases there is no detectable connection to the Aṭṭhakathās. 

Thus, for instance, Kacc 312 states that the loc. is used in the sense of the instr. This rule describes according to Kacc-v constructions like 
(naggā) hatthesu piṇḍā*ya caranti* (Vin I 90,11, 20 ; 91,1). Neither Sp nor Sp-ṭ and Vmv address this usage. Since the Aṭṭhakathās occasionally interpret the loc. in the sense of the instr.,136 one cannot, of course, exclude the possibility that the compilator of Kacc composed this sutta with reference to this type of annotations. On the other hand, since there is no clear indication that they were known to or considered by the author(s) of Kacc-v, it is not possible to decide with any degree of certainty whether the compilator(s) of Kacc actually relied on the Aṭṭhakathās. Another sutta - Kacc 308: kvaci dutiyā chaṭṭhīnaṃ *atthe*
- states that "in some cases the acc. is used in the sense of the gen." 
Kacc-v illustrates this rule by quoting M I 240,29 : api ssu maṃ Aggivessana tisso upamāyo137 paṭibhaṃsu. Buddhaghosa does not address this usage in Ps. Thus the general impression is that both Kacc and Kacc-v were composed independently of the Aṭṭhakathās. This conclusion would seem to be corroborated by the absence in Kacc and Kacc-v of important grammatical analyses found in the Aṭṭhakathās (cf. 

§§ 7–13).

## Iv. Post-Kaccāyana Pāli Grammars And Commentaries Iv.1. Kaccāyana-Vutti (Kacc-V) Iv.1.1. The Authorship Of Kacc-V

§ 44. Kacc-v is no doubt the oldest extant commentary on Kacc and therefore of particular importance for the history and development of Pāli grammar. Since post-Kacc Pāli grammarians never mention any, it is unlikely that there were other commentaries before it.138 The Sinhalese grammarians attribute Kacc-v to Saṅghanandin, whose name occurs only in this context. It is not possible to trace this tradition further back than Saddhammasaṅgaha139 (the end of the fourteenth century A.D.)140 and Śrī Rahula's Padasādhanaṭīkā (fifteenth century A.D.),
141 but one cannot, of course, exclude the possibility that it is older. The Burmese tradition as reflected in Gv obviously regarded Mahākaccāyana as the author of both Kacc and Kacc-v.142 In general the Pāli grammarians refer to the author of Kacc-v as *vuttikāra*143 as opposed to the *suttakāra.*
§45. It is questionable whether Kacc-v as a whole is composed by the same person because the *sandhi* chapter differs from the other chapters in the way it paraphrases each sutta. In contrast to the other chapters which use the verb ā*pajjate* to indicate that a grammatical operation obtains, the *sandhi* chapter invariably uses *pappoti*, e.g. lopaṃ *pappoti* or *papponti* at Kacc-v 12 through 17, contrasting with lopaṃ ā*pajjate* or ā*pajjante*, e.g. at Kacc 220. They also differ with respect to the formulation of the contrastive sections of the exegesis of Kacc: in the *sandhi* chapter this section is invariably introduced by *kasm*ā, elsewhere by kimatthaṃ. This difference in style seems to indicate that the commentary on the *sandhi* chapter has a different author from the rest of the work.

## Iv.1.2. Date Of Kacc-V

§ 46. Internal evidence indicates that the compilator(s) of the kā*raka* chapter of Kacc-v must have known the Kāśikā (seventh century A.D.), which therefore is the *terminus post quem* of this part of Kacc-v. In fact, part of the commentary on Pāṇ I 4:57: *cādayo 'sattve*, which defines the particles, has absurdly been added to Kacc-v 286 as an illustration of the meaning of the nom., which is defined at Kacc 286: liṅgatthe pa*ṭhamā*. 

After quoting examples of the use of nom. like puriso purisā *eko dve*,
Kacc-v continues by adding the particles *ca vā ha aha*, etc.,144 the order of which corresponds exactly to the order in which they are quoted in Kāśikā. The inclusion of particles as instances of *liṅgattha* is incomprehensible. If one assumes that Kacc-v as a whole was finalized after the seventh century A.D., it may belong to the first half of the eighth century A.D.

## Iv.1.3. The Standard Versions Of Kacc-V

§ 47. The question of the authorship of Kacc-v is not crucial in the light of the fact that Mmd comments upon a version of Kacc-v which in many respects is markedly different from its present-day Sinhalese and Burmese versions (see IV.1.2). To complicate matters even more : they are mutually different. Thus the Burmese version differs from the Sinhalese not only with respect to the purely exegetical parts of the commentary, but also as regards the number, order and occasional analysis (*viggaha*, Skt *vigraha*) of the examples illustrating each rule. 

Even Sinhalese manuscripts differ among themselves.145
§ 48. The main cause of the complicated textual transmission of Kacc-v is that indigenous scholars read the text in the light of the comprehensive grammatical literature and commentarial literature devoted to the explication of Kacc and Kacc-v. In certain cases scholars would simply add a new paragraph to the explanation of any given sutta based upon the works of post-Kacc Pāli grammarians. This has given rise to numerous interpolations that were added to the text at different periods of time during its transmission. All extant versions derive from the same archetype because they all share one scribal mistake: Kacc-v 35 quotes Ja II 316,22 with the reading *vijj*ā instead of *vijjāmaya*ṃ.

146
§ 49. If one compares the version of Kacc-v on which Mmd depends with the one known to Chapaṭa, the author of Kacc-nidd, it becomes abundantly clear that already by the beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. Kacc-v had become inflated by massive interpolation. Chapaṭa mentions some of the sources, but he may not have been aware of all of them. Most of the interpolations consist of far-fetched interpretations of any given ca of a sutta, which were added to the original text.

## Iv.1.4. Reformulations Of Kacc-V

§ 50. In a few cases Mmd quotes readings that are not found in the standard Burmese and Sinhalese versions of Kacc-v. Thus, for instance, in the annotations on Kacc-v 41, Mmd147 reproduces the following passage: tiṇṇaṃ vyañjanānam antare ye sarūpā *tesam pi ādissa lopo* hoti: "among three consonants [constituting a consonant cluster] the first of those that are identical is elided". In spite of the fact that this formulation is the only one that is meaningful in the context, the standard editions have different readings. Thus Ee reads tiṇṇ*am pi* byañjanānaṃ antare sarūpānaṃ *kvaci lopo hoti.* The same passage in Ce (1904) reads: ca-saddaggahaṇena tiṇṇam pi byañjanānaṃ sarūpānaṃ *kvaci lopo hoti*, whereas Be and Ce (1898) read tiṇṇaṃ byañjanānaṃ antare ye sarūpā tesam pi lopo hoti. An interesting quotation from Dāṭhānāga's Niruttisā*ramañjūs*ā in Subhūti's Nāmamāla148 shows that scholars differentiated between the original and the new reading (*purimap*āṭha and *navapāṭha*) of this passage. Except for minor discrepancies the old one is identical with Be and Ce (1898), whereas Ce
(1904) and Ee have adopted the new reading, except that Ee retains antare, thus apparently merging the old and the new one.

§ 51. Another interesting quotation which shows that the standard text has been edited is found at Mmd 440,19–20 : "ekassa ekā hoti dasassa ca raso hotī" ti ādim āha, i.e., "ekā is substituted for eka and *rasa* is substituted for *dasa".* This has been reformulated in the standard versions of Be and Ce as *ekassa ek*ā149 hoti *dasassa ca dakārassa ro* ā*deso hoti*: "ekā is substituted for eka and the phoneme r is substituted for the phoneme d of *dasa".*
 147Mmd 55,8–9.

148Quoted at Nāmamāla xiii, 11–12: *imassa ca vuttiyaṃ "ca-saddaggahaṇena* tiṇṇaṃ pi byañjanānaṃ antare ye sarūpā tesam pi lopo hotī" ti ca "casaddaggahaṇena tiṇṇam pi byañjanānaṃ sarūpānaṃ *kvaci lopo hotī" ti cā ti* 
'me dve pāṭhā bhinnā, tesu paṭhamapāṭho va purimapāṭho, dutiyapāṭho pana navapāṭho, taṃ idāni paṭhanti.

149Ee eko.

## Iv.1.5. Kacc-V As Interpreter Of Kacc

§ 52. The obscure formulation of certain rules in combination with the uncertainty caused by *sandhi* must have caused the compiler of Kacc-v many problems. In some cases it is questionable whether the interpretation reflects the intention of the original. Thus for instance Kacc-v 49 quotes both *puthujjano* (D I 3,32) and *puthubhūta*ṃ (D II 106,10) under Kacc 49 (see §42) in spite of the fact that in the cpd *puthubhūtaṃ puthu* is < Skt *pthu.* Another instance, according to Kacc-v 73 the sutta gāva se means that āva is substituted for the final element of go before the gen. sg. ending. This indicates that the scholiast interpreted gāva as < go + āva meaning āva is substituted for the vowel o of *go.* Although the interpretation is sensible it is syntactically difficult to defend: the sutta can only mean gāva occurs before the termination of the gen. sg. viz. 

gā*vassa.* However, this form is not recorded in the canon, only *gavassa* occurs. This would indicate that the reading *gāva* might be a sandhi form go + ava > gāva. On the other hand, the following suttas presuppose the morpheme āva. There is evidently no obvious solution to this problem. In one case it appears that the scholiasts have misinterpreted the *sandhi* form *namh' āni* at Kacc 647: *akkose namh'* 
āni, as namhi + āni. The suffix, however, is ani, cf. Pāṇ III 3 112, of which Kacc 647 is a verbatim reproduction.150 The anonymous commentator also misinterprets Kacc 246, which has given rise to the ghost word *tudampati* (see § 87).

§ 53. Kacc-v often takes the opportunity to complement the rules of Kacc so as to enlarge their scope. In the majority of cases it is done on the interpretation of any given *ca.* For instance, Kacc 67: *no ca dv'-*
ā*dito namhi* states that the numerals dvi, etc., take an additional n (ā*gama*) before the endings of gen. pl. Kacc-v adds on the interpretation of ca an additional ssa, quoting two examples, one of which is canonical: catassannaṃ *itthīna*ṃ and *tissannaṃ vedanāna*ṃ (S V 21,23). There is only one recorded canonical example of the use of *catassanna*ṃ at A II 154,33. Examples like this are not uncommon and indicate the wish to improve upon Kacc so that it describes more fully recorded usage. An interesting case is the annotation on Kacc 69: ā*dito o ca.* The *vuttikāra* interprets this to mean that ṃ and o are optionally substituted for the loc. 

morpheme of ā*di.* The substitute ṃ is wrongly read into the rule from Kacc 68: *am-ā pato smiṃ-smānaṃ vā.* The example *ādiṃ* is certainly not to be interpreted as loc.; the other example, ādo, is recorded. The interpretation may have been motivated by the concluding paragraph which, on the interpretaton of ca, claims that ā, o, and ṃ are used as substitutes for the loc. morpheme after other words; 151 the examples are divā *ca ratto ca haranti ye bali*ṃ (Sn 223) and Bārānasiṃ *ahu*152 rājā
(Ja V 68,28). The last example is interesting because the recorded reading is Bārānassa*ṃ ahū*, not the problematic Bārā*nasiṃ ahu*153 which would seem to stem from a different manuscript tradition. 

However, the underlying intention of the exegesis is clear: it aims at complementing Kacc so as to bring its description in line with recorded usage.

## Iv.1.6. Canonical And Non-Canonical Quotations In Kacc-V

§54. There are close to 200 canonical quotations in Kacc-v, which shows that the commentator(s) who compiled the *vutti* took pains to illustrate the rules by means of examples taken from the Pāli canon. So far it has been possible to identify approximately 23 quotations from Dīgha, 21 from Majjhima, 13 from Saṃyutta, 10 from Aṅguttara, and 34 from Vinaya. From the Khuddaka there are, not surprisingly, 44 quotations from Dhammapada, 15 from Suttanipāta, 6 from Khuddakakāṭha, 20 from the Jātaka, 2 from Udāna, 3 from Itivuttaka, and 3 151Kacc-v ad loc.: *ca-saddaggahaṇena aññasmā pi smiṃvacanassa ā o a*ṃ ā*desā honti vā.*
152Ce1 āhu; BeCe2Ee *ahu.*
153Ja V 68,28 reads *Bārānassa*ṃ (v.l. °ṇ*asya*ṃ) ahū; cf. Sadd 204,13ff.; Sadd 644,5 : aññasmā ā ca: aññasmā saddato smiṃ-vacanassa aṃ-o-ā-ādesā honti:
… Bārāṇasiṃ ahū rājā (Ja V 68,28). vā ti kiṃ? Bārāṇasyaṃ mahārāja (Ja II 
435,14). Bārāṇassan ti pi pāṭho.

quotations from Apadāna. In addition, there is one quotation from Vibhaṅga, as well as a number of unidentifiable quotations from Pāli literature that must be considered lost. To these examples we may add all those instances - most of them canonical - where no context is quoted.

§55. Most of the quotations are found in the *sandhi* chapter and the kāraka chapter. Other illustrations occur unsystematically, which leaves the impression that they have been added more or less at random. Thus, for instance, Kacc-v 57 quotes bhoti Kharā*diye* (Ja I 160,3)154 as an example of voc. of fem. in ā, but omits quoting examples to illustrate the subequent rules, although this could easily have been done.

§ 56. What is particularly interesting about these quotations is the fact that they rarely deviate from the transmitted text of the canon. When they do, it raises the interesting question of which exemplars were used by the compilator(s). Thus, for instance, the quotation from M I 240,29 at Kacc-v 308: reads *upamāyo* for *upam*ā of BeEe.

155 Kacc-v 312 quotes Vin III 212,6 as an example of the use of the loc. in the sense of the direct object with the remarkable reading *bhikkhūsu* for Ee *bhikkh*ū. Be, on the other hand, reads *bhikkhūsu*, so we must conclude that this reading was actually found in some manuscripts or that Be was edited on the basis of Kacc-v.

156
§ 57. Some of the examples were no doubt quoted from memory, which has caused slight distortions of the original. In most cases it is possible to identify the canonical source. Thus the quotation at Kacc-v 18: te 
'n*āgatā* is probably based upon Vin V 221,14 : *te anāgatā honti*, and the source of the quotation at Kacc-v 20: *idh' eva maraṇaṃ bhavissati* would seem to be Vin III 13,17 : *idh' eva me maraṇaṃ bhavissati.* The two odd quotations at Kacc-v 27: sa ve muni jātibhayaṃ *adass*ī and eso dhammo padissati are most probably distorted versions of Sn 209: sa ve munī jātikhayantadassī and Ja V 195,21 : *eso dhūmo padissati.* The grammatically impossible quotation at Kacc-v 36 *parosahassa*ṃ bhikkhusataṃ is a distorted version of S I 192,30* : *parosahassa*ṃ bhikkhūnaṃ.

157 The original of Kacc-v 38: ahaṃ *eva nūna b*ālo must be Vin IV 331,14 : ahaṃ eva nū*na bāl*ā, and the quotation *dhammaṃ vo* bhikkhave desissāmi at Kacc-v 147 is probably based upon Vin I 23,25 :
dhammaṃ vo desessāmi. The quotation *sahâpi Gaggena saṅgho* uposathaṃ kareyya at Kacc-v 289 reads like a slightly edited version of Vin I 123,24 : saṅgho saha vā Gaggena vinā vā Gaggena uposathaṃ kareyya. The quotation sace maṃ samaṇ*o Gotamo nâlapissati* at Kacc-v 309 is based upon S I 177,27–28 : sace maṃ samaṇo Gotamo ālapissati 
… no ce maṃ samaṇ*o Gotamo ālapissati.* In one case a wrong quotation is due to scribal error (see §47).

## Iv.1.7. Interpolations In Kacc-V

§58. The main source of interpolation is no doubt Mmd, from which the main part of the commentary on Kacc 330 has been taken, as well as his remarks on the interpretation of any given ca or the like. Another important source is Rūp, but there are also other sources, some of which cannot be identified with any degree of certainty.158 In some cases, commentators were aware of the source of a particular interpolation and identified it. A few examples will suffice to show the character of such interpolations. 

§59. After the examples quoted at Kacc-v 182, Ce1–2 (1898 and 1904)
add *casaddaggahaṇena abyaggamanaso naro* (A I 130,1) ti ādisu manasaddato sissa okā*râdeso hoti.* The source is Mmd 165,5–8. This interpretation is not in Be (1974) or Ee, but very early on it had become part of the exegetical tradition as appears from Sadd, Kacc-nidd, and Kacc-vaṇṇ.

159
§60. After the counter-example *brahm*ā quoted at Kacc-v 198, Ce1-2 as well as Ee interpolate : uttaṃ iti bhā*vaniddeso* (Ee °ena) katthaci abhāvaṃ dasseti: brahmassa. The source is Rūp 123: *uttam iti bhāvaniddeso katthaci abhāvadassanattho: brahmunā, brahmehi brahmebhi.* 
Be does not contain this interpolation. However, in the paragraph that follows the counter-examples at Kacc-v 200 all versions share the same interpolation: ā*rattaggahaṇena katthaci aniyama*ṃ (Ee w.r. *ni°) dasseti*:
satthussa, pitussa, mā*tussa, bhātussa.* The source is Rūp 159: ā*rattam* iti bhā*vaniddesena katthaci aniyamaṃ dasseti.*
§ 61. An example from Kacc-v 277 may illustrate the extent to which the text sometimes has been altered. The concluding paragraph interpreting ca reads: casaddaggahaṇena sesesv api ye mayā nôpadi*ṭṭhā* apādānappayogikā *te payogavicakkhaṇehi yojetabb*ā. Mmd neither quotes nor paraphrases this paragraph, and, moreover, interprets the use of ca otherwise: caggahaṇena aññathā pi pañcamīvibhattiñ ca chaṭṭhīdutiyā-tatiyāvibhattiyo ca saṅgaṇhāti.160 It is presumably an interpolation made by post-Buddhapiya grammarians, although it is difficult to trace the formulation to any particular grammar. Aggavaṃsa has written 159See Kacc-nidd 70,14–17 : *idha caggahaṇena abyaggamanaso naro* (see supra), 
Kassapassa vaco sutvā (Ja VI 227,5*) ti ettha sivacanassa ca aṃvacanassa ca okārâdeso hoti; Kacc-vaṇṇ 180,4–8 : *abyaggamanaso naro* (see supra), 
Kassapassa vaco (see supra) ty ādīni caggahaṇaphalāni; tattha ca abyaggamanasaddato simhi kate caggahaṇena siss' okāraṃ *katvā sakārâgame* kate rūpaṃ, Kassapassa vaco ti vacasaddato amhi kate caggahaṇena aṃvacanassa okāraṃ katvā sese kate r*ūpaṃ*; for the second example, see Sadd 663,27 and §377: aṃ*vacanass' o.*
160Mmd 218,33–34 ; cf. Rūp 107,7 : casaddena yathāyogaṃ dutiyā chaṭṭhī ca. 

a similar paragraph at Sadd 708,23–24, not related to the interpretation of ca, but to ādi (sic): ā*disaddena ye amhehi anupadiṭṭhā apādānappayogā te payogavicakkhanehi yojetabbā.* It is possible that the source of interpolation is Kacc-nidd, which, in addition, quotes the interpretations of Mmd and its *ṭīkā*.

161
§62. Kacc-v 358 is an extreme instance of interpolation. It is possible to deduce from Mmd that the version of the commentary that was known to Vajirabuddhi must have read: tad assa ṭṭhānaṃ *icc etasmiṃ atthe* īya-ppaccayo hoti. madanassa ṭhānaṃ madanīyaṃ, bandhanassa ṭhā*naṃ bandhanīyaṃ, mucchanassa*162 ṭhā*naṃ mucchanīyaṃ.*
163 evaṃ rajanīyaṃ, *kamanīyaṃ.*

## Pāli Grammar And Grammarians 99

§63. Vajirabuddhi's annotation was, in turn, utilized by Aggavaṃsa at Sadd 789,29 (§774): *upādānâdito iyo hitatthâdisu.* However, the reading *dussaniya*ṃ of Be would seem to be based upon Mogg-p ad Mogg IV 69.

166 finally, the vutti in EeCe1–2 concludes with the following interpolation: ca-saddaggahaṇena iya-ila-ppaccayā honti. 

rañño idaṃ ṭhānaṃ, rā*jiyaṃ, evaṃ rājila*ṃ; the examples quoted in this paragraph are mentioned neither at Mmd nor at Rūp or Sadd 789,27ff.;
the paragraph stems from Cūḷ-nir as indicated by Kacc-bh-nṭ 167 : Cūḷaniruttyâdipakaraṇe tad assa ṭhānam īyo cā ti sutte casaddena ilaiyapaccayā *hontī ti.* It thus appears that Cūḷ-nir, in contrast to Mmd, for example, interpreted ca so as to include the suffixes iya and *ila* which are not recorded in Pāli. 

§64. In a few cases the anonymous editors of Kacc-v have copied verses from Rūp and the Bījâkhyā and inserted them in the relevant section of the vutti. Thus all versions quote the following kārikā from Rūp:
168 yo vadeti sa kattā ti yaṃ vuttam kamman ti vuccati yo paṭiggāhako tassa sampadānaṃ vijāniyā It is not mentioned in Mmd, but it must have been interpolated before Chapaṭa's time because he quotes the beginning of it at Kacc-nidd 109,1 : "yo vadeti" ādim āha.169 A verse from Bījâkhyā (see §§3–4) has been interpolated in Kacc-v 354:
na vuḍḍhi nīlapītâdo paccaye saṇakārake phakāro phussasaddassa siro ti sirasaṃ *vade*170

## Iv.2. Post-Kaccāyana Pāli Grammars And Grammarians As Reflected In The Grammatical Literature Iv.2.1. The Question Of Chronology

§65. The chronology of post-Kacc Pāli grammars, quite apart from the problems attached to Kacc-v, constitutes a serious problem which cannot be resolved satisfactorily: most of the literature is no longer extant and has to be studied on the basis of a few fragments quoted in Pāli grammars written at a later date. The following grammars are treated in the order suggested by internal evidence. Some of the works like the Saṅgaha, and the two *sandhi* treatises which Buddhapiya utilized, cannot be fitted into any relative chronology.

## Iv.2.2. Mahānirutti (Mahā-Nir)

§66. The Mahā-nir is, like Kacc and Nir-piṭ, attributed to Buddha's disciple Mahākaccāyana (see §14). It is described in Mmd-pṭ (see §112)
as a particular grammar of someone belonging to a different school 
(nikā*yantaravāsin*),
171 which would indicate that it differs from the school of Kacc. However, since Cūḷ-nir comments on Kacc it may not be wrong to assume that Mahā-nir also comments upon it. Within the relative chronology the work belongs to the period after Kacc-v, whose existence it seems to presuppose, and it is thus datable to the second half of the eighth century A.D.

§67. It is possible to deduce from the limited number of references to and quotations from Mahā-nir in other Pāli grammars that the treatise was composed in the form of suttas and a prose commentary accompanied by *kārikās*. 

§68. Vajirabuddhi identifies Mahā-nir and Sudattakisivanirutti as two sources of interpolations made in Kacc (see § 18). The interpolated suttas show a marked dependence on Pāṇini. In a few cases they depend on the Kātantra, and a couple of suttas seem to presuppose knowledge of Kacc-v (see §69). Since it is not possible to distinguish between suttas from Mahā-nir and Sudattakisivanirutti they are quoted and identified in the context of Mahā-nir. All of the them except sutta 33 are interpolated in the *kāraka* section. As indicated by Mmd they must have been accompanied by a prose commentary:
1. *tesaṃ param ubhayappattimhi* (Mmd 237,14), cf. Kāt II 4:16172 2. sesā kammakaraṇasampadānâpadānasāyā*diniddesesu* (242,38), cf.

§69. Aggavaṃsa has based a number of paragraphs in Sadd on these suttas, incorporating the relevant examples into them: sutta 8 is utilized for Sadd §636, sutta 11 for Sadd §638, sutta 20 for Sadd §604, sutta 23 for Sadd §638, sutta 31 for Sadd §670, and sutta 32 for Sadd §670. 

Some of them are particularly interesting because they describe uses of the cases in Pāli which are also dealt with by the Saṅgahakāra (see IV.2.7). Thus the examples that illustrate 24: "the locative in construction with √gah, etc., is used in the sense of the acc.", namely
(*Bodhisattassa) muddhani … cumbitv*ā (Ja VI 291,2–3, and (*purisassa*)
nānābāhāsu gahetvā (M I 365,19), are also quoted in Mmd as illustrations of the view of the Saṅgahakāra.175 Neither Kacc nor Kacc-v describes this usage. However, the examples that illustrate 25: "[the locative] is used in the sense of the instrument in the context of begging for alms", viz. naggā hatthesu piṇḍā*ya caranti* (Vin I 90,20), *sama*ṇā pattesu piṇḍā*ya caranti* (…), are quoted at Kacc-v 312. Sutta 29: "the nominative is used in the sense of the accusative" is based upon a peculiar analysis of the well-known canonical phrase *yena bhagavā ten'* 
upasaṅkami. According to this, *Bhagav*ā is used in the acc. because the underlying sentence structure is assumed to be *yattha Bhagavanta*ṃ adakkhi.176 This analysis is not supported by the Aṭṭhakathās.

§70. Buddhapiya concludes the *kāraka* chapter of Rūp by quoting a verse from Mahā-nir summarising the case terminology of the Aṭṭhakathās:
paccattam upayogañ ca, karaṇaṃ sampadāniyaṃ.

nissakkaṃ sāmivacanaṃ, *bhummâlapanam aṭṭhaman ti.*177 Aggavaṃsa quotes it as a summary (*uddāna*) of a prose passage propounding the Niruttilakkhaṇa, i.e., the definition (of the cases) of the 
(Mahā)nirutti. This indicates that already at the time of the composition of Mahā-nir, grammarians attempted to integrate the terminology and grammatical tradition of the Aṭṭhakathās into their grammars. It is remarkable that the Niruttilakkhaṇa substitutes ā*mantaṇa* "the act of addressing, inviting" (Skt ā*mantraṇa*178) for ā*lapana.*179 The same term is used to denote the voc. in Rūp, presumably because it was used in Buddhapiya's main sources Mahā-nir, Cūḷ-nir, and Mañj.180 It may have been introduced from the Kātantra.181
§71. According to Aggavaṃsa Mahā-nir differs from Kacc with respect to the definition of the tense (kāla) of the verb which is described as sixfold as opposed to Kacc where it is defined as fourfold.182 Both Mmd and Rūp quote a verse from Mahā-nir defining the nature of the verb:
yan tikālaṃ tipurisaṃ kriyāvāci tikārakaṃ atiliṅgaṃ dvivacanaṃ tad ākhyātan ti vuccati.183
§72. Gv 70 mentions an abridgement of Mahā-nir called Mahāniruttisaṅ*khepa* about which nothing is known.

## Iv.2.3. Sudattakisivanirutti (Sudatta-Nir)

§73. Mmd is the only Pāli grammar that mentions this treatise. Nothing is known about it except that certain scholars copied suttas from it and interpolated them in Kacc. Like Mahā-nir, the author of Mmd-pṭ considers it a particular grammar by someone belonging to a different school (see §66). It cannot be excluded, however, that it is a commentary on Kacc. Perhaps it is composed at the time of Mahā-nir.

§74. Formally it consisted of suttas and a commentary. Since it is not possible to separate the suttas of Sudatta-nir from those that have been copied from Mahā-nir, they have been treated together (see §68).

## Iv.2.4. Niruttipiṭaka (Nir-Piṭ)

§75. The Nir-piṭ is, like Mahā-nir, attributed to Mahākaccāyana.184 The way in which the work is quoted or referred to in grammars like Mogg and Sadd would indicate that it is composed after Mahā-nir. It is not possible to determine whether it is based upon Kacc or related to Kacc. Presumably it emulates Kacc and Kacc-v like Mahā-nir. One may tentatively date it to the first half of the ninth century A.D.

§76. It appears from the quotations in Sadd and Mogg that Nir-piṭ was composed in prose and *kārikās.*
§77. Like Cūḷ-nir (see IV.2.5), Nir-piṭ must have listed paradigms for all Pāli nominals because Aggavaṃsa often contrasts the various nominal and adjectival paradigms established in Nir-piṭ with those of Cūḷ-nir and Kacc.185 Thus, for instance, he mentions in the discussion of the paradigm of the present participle *gacchaṃ · gacchanto*, etc., that the Nir-piṭ claims that such forms as *mahanto*, etc., exclusively are used as nom. and voc. pl., and, moreover, that the Nir-piṭ establishes this after quoting a g*āthā* summarizing a series of such participles in the nom. sg.: mahaṃ bhavaṃ caraṃ *tiṭṭhaṃ.*
186 A similar *gāth*ā is quoted in Rūp.187 It is likely that Nir-piṭ contained such verses enumerating a series of words belonging to a particular inflectional category. This is also the case with Rūp, which may have utilized Nir-piṭ for this purpose. 

§78. In his discussion of the pronominal inflection, Moggallāna claims that Nir-piṭ authorizes the inflectional endings ā, e, and āya in abl., loc., 
and dat., respectively, except in the case of the pronominal stems *ta, eta*,
and *ima.*188 However, Mogg maintains that this exception is meaningless as it is contradicted by the canon, which he proves by quoting relevant examples.189
§79. Aggavaṃsa quotes a couple of interesting passages from Nir-piṭ. 

One of them is the definition of the *dvandva* compound,190 which he must have used when reformulating Kacc 331 at Sadd §709. The author of Nir-piṭ must have utilized Pāṇinian grammar for the description of the various types of *dvandva* compounds because Moggallāna reproduces at Mogg-v III 19 his definition showing dependence on Pāṇ II 4:2 foll. and Mahā-bh ad loc.191
§80. It is possible to deduce from another quotation in Sadd192 that Nir-piṭ like Cūḷ-nir contained a chapter on the Pāli nipātas: vuttaṃ hi Niruttipiṭake Nipātapadaparicchede: "tuṃ iti catutthiyā" ti.193 Rūp follows Nir-piṭ in this regard.194 Sadd has also preserved the def. of the verb: vuttaṃ h' etaṃ Niruttipiṭake "kiriyālakkhaṇaṃ *ākhyātika*ṃ aliṅgabhedaṃ", which is related to the verse which both Mmd and Rūp quote from Mahā-nir (see §71).

195
§81. It appears from another passage that Nir-piṭ defines the term *nirutti* in accordance with its canonical definition: Niruttipiṭ*ake pana "saṃkh*ā samaññā paññatti vohāro nāmaṃ *nāmakammaṃ nāmadheyyaṃ nirutti* vyañjanaṃ abhilāpo (= Nidd I 127,12–14 ; Dhs §1306; As 390,13–91,20)" 
ti imehi dasahi vuttā dhammajāti nirutti nāma.196

## Iv.2.5. Cūḷanirutti (Cūḷ-Nir)

§82. The Burmese and Sinhalese grammarians attribute Cūḷ-nir to Yamakamahāthera.197 The treatise appears to be lost, but it is possible to form an idea of its nature through quotations and references to it in Mogg-p and Sadd. (Abhinava)-Cūḷanirutti which is still extant in manuscripts is apparently based upon Cūḷ-nir and may thus give an idea of its character.198 Cūḷ-nir was probably composed after Nir-piṭ (see §75) and may thus belong the second half of the ninth century A.D.

§83. It appears from the few identifiable quotations found scattered in post-Kaccāyana grammatical literature that Cūḷ-nir is a commentary on Kacc. Together with its commentary (*vaṇṇan*ā), the Mañjūsā (see IV.2.6), it is undoubtedly one of the most influential post-Kaccāyana Pāli grammars. Aggavaṃsa often refers to it together with Kacc and Nir-piṭ in the Padamālā, 199 when discussing the nominal, pronominal, or other paradigms of the Pāli, occasionally contrasting its paradigms with those of Kacc and Nir-piṭ. 

§84. It is somewhat confusing that quotations from it are often ascribed to the Nirutti, but it is possible to deduce from the information contained in later lit. that they must stem from Cūḷ-nir. Most of them are k*ārikā*s. 

Vijitāvī quotes in Kacc-vaṇṇ a verse from the Nirutti (= Cūḷ-nir) interpreting Kacc 14 followed by a few examples:
vuttañ ca Niruttiyaṃ pubbavikāro aparo vikāro duvidho mato kvaci ty ādinā suttenā vikāro aparo mato.

tatth' eva luttasaddena pubbavikāro vidhīyate iselayo munelayo rathesabho ti ādisu.

200 Aggavaṃsa has based Sadd §35 on this interpretation and copied the examples.201 Vijitāvī also quotes a verse from the Nirutti interpreting Kacc 35. The verse adds on the interpretation of ca sixteen additional consonantal ā*gamas* to the eight defined at Kacc 35:
202 yavamadâdisuttena ṭṭ*habyañjana-m-āgamo* casaddena pana sesā catuvīsati byañjanā.

203 These ā*gamas* are rejected as not instantiated in the Pāli.204 Although post-Kaccāyana grammarians regard them as fictions, we find them quoted in Saddasāratthajālinī 270. 

tradition is followed by Rūp which quotes the same *sandhi* form in the chapter on particles,206 as well as later grammarians like Sadd and Pay, both of which are dependent on Rūp.

§86. Moggallāna mentions at Mogg-v II 52 the following two forms of voc. sg. of kaññā: *bhoti kaññe · bhoti kaññā.* He justifies the form *kaññ*ā by referring to the fact that it is mentioned in the Nirutti (= Cūḷ-nir)
although it is not described in Kacc.207 There is no reason to doubt that Nirutti in this case = Cūḷ-nir because Aggavaṃsa quotes the same forms in Sadd referring to Cūḷ-nir.208
§87. In another context he criticizes the author of Kacc-v for permitting the unwarranted Sanskritism *sugandhi*, pointing out that it is found neither in the canon nor in the Nirutti.209 Moreover, he observes that the ghost word *tudampati* is not found as an example in the Nirutti, as is the case with Kacc-v 246 and other commentaries.210 In one case he has formulated his description of the suffixes la and iya at Mogg IV 58:
tena datte l'-iyā, with reference to their definition in the Nirutti. In the discussion of this sutta at Mogg-p he quotes a fairly long passage from the Nirutti which is related to Mahā-bh on Pāṇ V 3:83 (cf. Kāś ad loc.).

211
§88. Both Rūp212 and Sadd213 quote a prose passage from Cūḷ-nir defining the nature of the verb: kālakārakapurisaparidī*pikaṃ kriyālakkhaṇam ākhyātika*ṃ.

214 Sadd quotes another passage concerning the pronominal forms te-me, tava-mam, tuyhaṃ*-mayhaṃ.*
215
§89. As mentioned above (see §63), unknown scholars have interpolated a passage in Kacc-v 358 based upon Cūḷ-nir. 

## Iv.2.6. Mañjūsā (Mañj)

§90. Sinhalese grammarians attribute the commentary on Cūḷ-nir, Cūḷaniruttivaṇṇanā or Mañj, to a certain Patañjali. Gv 60, on the other hand, attributes it to an old ācariya (*pubbâcariya*). The Mañj was known to Vajirabuddhi, who apparently elaborates the views of Patañjali concerning the reality of the kā*raka*s in an interesting digression on Kacc 283
(see §93).

216 It is thus reasonable to assume that Mañj was written in the ninth century A.D. It is regrettable that this interesting work appears to be lost217 because it has exerted a major influence on most Pāli grammarians who quote from it. In contrast to the majority of other Pāli grammars, the Mañj is influenced by contemporary philosophy of language and apparently also by Buddhist philosophy.218
§91. The extant fragments show that Mañj was composed in the form of k*ārikā*s accompanied by explicating prose.

§92. Buddhapiya quotes several verses from the Mañj. Most of them occur in the chapter of Rūp devoted to the description of the *kāraka*s. 

They show that Patañjali to some extent has based his description of Pāli's case grammar on Bharthari's Trikaṇḍī (TK). In fact, some of the verses are almost verbatim reproductions of the TK. Thus, for instance, the verse defining the apādāna *kāraka* is a version of TK III 7:136, except that it substitutes *anumeyavisayañ ca for apekṣitakriyaṃ ceti* of TK:
niddiṭṭhavisayaṃ kiñci upā*ttavisayaṃ tath*ā anumeyavisayañ cā ti apādā*nan tidhā mataṃ.*
219 Other verses substitute semantically equivalent Pāli terms for the terms used by Bharthari, like, for instance, the verse defining the *sampad*āna kāraka, which is based upon VP III 7: 129:
anirākaraṇârādhanabbhanuññavasen' idha sampadānaṃ *tidhā vuttaṃ rukkhayācakabhikkhavo.*220
§93. In the commentary on Rūp 288 (= Kacc 284) Buddhapiya quotes two verses stating that the domain of words is defined by convention 
(vohā*ravisaya*) and is without ultimate reality (*nekantaparamatthika*);
the denotation of a word is something imagined (*buddhisaṃkappita*) and thus also the syntactic relation, which therefore only has an imaginary existence (*vijjamāno va*).

221 This argument is closely related to the ideas which Bharthari propounds in the introductory section of Sā*dhanasamuddeśa* TK III 7:1ff. The assumption of a connection between Mañj and this part of the TK is corroborated by the parallel section of Mmd 231,18ff. which evidently elaborates on ideas expressed in Mañj. In this excursus Vajirabuddhi uses the terms *satti* (Skt ś*akti*)
and *vyatti* (Skt *vyakti*) according to Bharthari.222
§94. Apart from these examples, Buddhapiya quotes verses defining 
(1) the voc. (ā*mantaṇa*),223 (2) the syntactical concepts of *kamma*,
224
(3) *karaṇa*,
225 (4) kattā, kammakattā, *hetukatt*ā, 226 (5) *sambandha*,
227
 
vohāravisayo saddo nekantaparamatthiko buddhisaṃkappito attho tass' attho ti pavuccati buddhiyā gahitattā *hi saṃyogo jāyate iti* saṃyogo vijjamāno va kattā bhavati jātiyā 222See, e.g. VP III 7:1ff.

223Rūp 93,16–18 : 
saddenâbhimukhīkāro vijjamānassa vatthuno āmantaṇaṃ vidhātabbe n' atthi rājā *bhavêti tan ti* Identified at Rūp-ṭ 92,1.

224Rūp 94,8–9 :
nibbattivikatippattibhedena tividhaṃ mataṃ. kattukriyâbhigammaṃ taṃ sukha'-ṅgāraṃ *nivesanan ti.*
This verse is not identified as coming from Mañj; but its dependence on VP III 7:45 is obvious: *nivārtyaṃ ca vikāryaṃ ca prāpyaṃ ceti tridhā matam.*
225Rūp 97,3–4 :
yassa sabbavisesena kriyāsaṃ*siddhihetut*ā sambhāvīyati taṃ vuttaṃ karaṇaṃ nāma kā*rakan ti* Identified at Rūp-ṭ 99,8 ; cf. VP III 7:93ff.

226Rūp 98,1–4 :
attappadhāno kiriyaṃ yo nibbatteti kārako. appayutto payutto vā sa kattā ti pavuccati. hetukattā ti kathito kattuno yo payojako.

kammakattā *ti sukaro kammabhūto kathīyate ti.*
Identified at Rūp-ṭ 101,19 ; Rūp-sn 165(=170),36.

and (6) the morphologico-semantical concept of samāsa.

228 In addition he quotes a verse defining the two types of negation *pariyud*āsa and pasajjapaṭisedha.229
§95. There are two prose passages from Mañj quoted in Sadd. The first deals with the vocative bho which is correctly described as being used with nouns in the voc. sg. and pl.230 The other is a long passage discussing the concept of liṅga which is indebted to Mahā-bh II 195,25ff.

231 Thus the verse that is part of this quotation is a Pāli version of a kārikā found in Mahā-bh II 196,4–5.

232 Vajirabuddhi quotes it in Mmd; he may have taken it from Mañj.233

## Iv.2.7. Saṅgaha (Sgh)

§96. The author of this treatise is referred to as the Saṅgahakāra (both in the sg. and pl.), perhaps in imitation of the name Saṅgrahakāra known from Sanskrit grammar. The Sgh is only known from a few quotations in Vajirabuddhi's Mmd and Chapaṭa's Kacc-nidd. It is not possible to date the work with any degree of certainty. However, it must have been composed before the tenth century A.D., which is the approximate date of Mmd, and after Kacc-v, which it appears to know, thus perhaps between the eighth and tenth centuries A.D.

§97. The quotations show that the treatise is composed in the form of kārikās with an explicating prose commentary. Since they are confined to the kā*raka* chapter of Mmd and Kacc-nidd, there is reason to believe that the treatise is exclusively devoted to the description of Pāli's case syntax. 

§98. Vajirabuddhi quotes in Mmd four prose passages from the Saṅgaha.

234 With the exception of the third one, the quotations are each followed by a large number of illustrative examples compiled by the Saṅgahakāra. Chapaṭa reproduces the second prose passage at Kacc-nidd 126,30–34 but in addition he quotes a verse whose subject matter is identical with the one formulated in the first prose passage quoted at Mmd 240,28–29.

235
§99. The majority of the examples are quoted from unidentifiable postcanonical Pāli literature. However, there are also a number of interesting canonical quotations. In a few cases Mmd reproduces canonical quotations which are found in Kacc-v in a slightly edited version. Thus, for instance the Vinaya quotation at Kacc-v 312: hatthesu piṇḍāya caranti (Vin I 90,11) is quoted as naggā hatthesu piṇḍā*ya caranti* (Vin I 
90,20).

236 The quotations show that the case terminology of the Saṅgaha is influenced by the terminology of the Aṭṭhakathās, which he must have utilized. Thus, for instance, he quotes D I 63,22–23 : *idam pi 'ssa hoti* sīlasmin ti as an example of the use of the loc. in the sense of the nom. Since Buddhaghosa mentions in Sv that the Mahâṭṭhakathā interprets the loc. as the nom. (*paccattavacanatthe … etaṃ bhumma*ṃ),
237 the interpretation is no doubt indebted to Sv.

§100. There are other examples of the Saṅgahakāra's use of the Pāli commentaries. For instance, he quotes Vin I 103,11 : ā*vikatā hi 'ssa* phāsu hoti, as an example of the use of the nom. in the sense of the instr. 

(sic). The exegesis that justifies this amazing statement is found in Kkh 26,25f.: āvikatā ti āvikatāya, pakāsitāyā ti attho; *alajjitā ti ādisu viya* idam pi karaṇatthe paccattavacanaṃ.

238 The interpretation of D II 
230,2 : ajjhāsayaṃ ā*dibrahmacariya*ṃ in the sense of the instr. is based upon the gloss on this construction at Sv: *karaṇatthe pacattavacanaṃ.*
239 It is thus clear that the Saṅgahakāra attempted to integrate the grammatical annotations of the Aṭṭhakathās into his own work.

§101. Aggavaṃsa composed Sadd §559: *paṭhamatthe tatiyā-sattamiyo*, and §660: *tatiyatthe paṭham*ā, with particular regard to the above interpretation of D I 63,22–23 and D II 230,2. Though it cannot be excluded that he knew the Sgh, it is more likely that he copied the description from Mmd, of which he was a careful reader.

## Iv.2.8. Mahāsandhi (Mahā-S)

§102. Mahā-s is only referred to once in Buddhapiya's Rūp-ṭ.

240 In the remarks on the introductory verse of Rūp he mentions that he utilized the *sandhi* treatises, i.e., Mahā-s and Cūḷ-s (see IV.2.9).

241
§103. The discussion in Rūp-ṭ of the views expressed in Mahā-s shows that it was a revised version of the *sandhi* chapter of Kacc. 

§104. It appears from Rūp-ṭ that the author has interpolated a restrictive tu in Kacc 29: *vagge ghosâghosānaṃ tatiyapaṭham*ā, so as to exclude the unwanted consequence of the imprecise formulation of the sutta that the voiced nasals belonging to each of the five groups (*vagga*) receive the third letter in the group of sonants as doubling. Buddhapiya rejects this interpolation on the grounds that since the ṭhāne of Kacc 28 is the governing rule (*adhikāra*) such a problem does not arise.242

## Iv.2.9. Cūḷasandhi (Cūḷ-S)

§105. This anonymous treatise on *sandhi* is, like Mahāsandhi, only known from a couple of quotations in Rūp-ṭ. Like Mahā-s Buddhapiya utilised it for the elaborate *sandhi* chapter of Rūp. 

§106. Like Mahā-s the work appears to be an edited version of Kacc.

§107. The discussion recorded in Rūp-ṭ 243 shows that the author reformulated Kacc 11 so as to read *assaraṃ byañjanaṃ parakkharaṃ naye*,
excluding the word *yutte* on the grounds that the phoneme ṃ (*niggah*īta) is not a consonant. The other quotation states that "when a preceding 
[vowel] is elided, a following i and u become e and o, respectively".244 This statement has probably been part of the elaboration of Kacc 14. 

Buddhapiya quotes it to justify his formulation of the comment on Rūp 16 (= Kacc 14).

245

## Iv.3. Extant Post-Kaccāyana Grammars And Commentaries Iv.3.1. Mukahamattadīpanī (Mmd)

§108. Mmd or Nyāsa, also called *Kaccāyanavuttivaṇṇan*ā, 246 is the oldest extant commentary on Kacc and Kacc-v. It is attributed to Vajirabuddhi247 or Vimalabuddhi who is also claimed to have composed a ṭīkā on Abhidhammâvatāra.

248 The date of Vajirabuddhi cannot be fixed with absolute certainty as Mmd contains no colophon containing a clue as to when it was composed. The work itself presupposes knowledge of Pāli grammars that are no longer extant. Vajirabuddhi mentions Sudattakisivanirutti (see IV.2.3) and Mahānirutti (see IV.2.2)
from which he quotes a number of suttas interpolated in Kacc (see §68), 
and he quotes from the work of the Saṅgahakāra (see IV.2.7). Internal evidence shows that he knows Patañjali's Mañjūsā (see IV.2.6). Since he quotes from an Abhidharma treatise ascribed to the ṭī*kākāra*,
249 whom the Mmd-pṭ 250 identifies with Ānanda, the M*ūlaṭīkākā*ra, who is traditionally placed in the eighth or ninth century A.D. (see *DPPN* s.v. 

11. Ānanda), he is to be placed between the Mūlaṭīkā*kāra* and Buddhapiya who refers to *Kaccāyanavaṇṇan*ā (= Nyāsa) in the introductory verse of Rūp251 and several times in Rūp-ṭ. Rūp was written before Mogg and Mogg-p (second half of the twelfth century A.D.) because Mogg-p 6,23–24 quotes Rūp 3,25–26 : kvaci saṃyogapubbā, ekārôkārā rassā iva vuccante. yathā: ettha, seyyo, *ottho, sotthi.* Mmd was thus probably composed in the tenth–eleventh centuries A.D. Because of its thoroughness Mmd has exerted a powerful influence on most Pāli grammars written in the tradition of Kacc. 

§109. Vajirabuddhi is a meticulous exegete of Kacc and Kacc-v, almost to the point of being pedantic. The general structure of each paragraph is that he first quotes and paraphrases each sutta, isolating and counting the number of words (*pada*) that constitute it, a practice that was imitated by Chapaṭa and Vijitāvī in Kacc-nidd and Kacc-vaṇṇ, respectively. 

Then he comments on its interpretation in Kacc-v, carefully noticing if the author himself is going to add a paragraph on the interpretation of any given ca or the like of Kacc. It is thus possible to deduce that if any 248See SVD 1223.

249Mmd 273,31. 250Mmd-pṭ 197,26. 251See Rūp-ṭ 3,28 : Kaccāyabyākaraṇañ ca tabbaṇṇanābhūtaṃ Nyāsaṃ.

such paragraph is not mentioned, it has most probably been interpolated at a later date. Finally, Vajirabuddhi comments on the examples and counterexamples illustrating the sutta in question. In some cases he quotes short passages from Kacc-v, some of which differ from the transmitted versions (see IV.1.4). In addition, he makes an effort to distinguish between original and interpolated suttas in Kacc (see §18). It is thus clear that Mmd is an invaluable source of information on the actual text of Kacc and Kacc-v at the time of the composition of Mmd.

§110. Mmd is in many ways an exegetical tour de force, whose main intention is to show how the individual suttas of Kacc and the explanations of the vutti in the final analysis can be derived by applying relevant rules from Kacc to the problem under discussion. Thus, for instance, in his comment on Kacc-v 44: abhi icc etassa sare pare abbhâdeso hoti: "*abbh* is substituted for *abhi* before a following vowel", he explains that since the use of the word *sare* from Kacc 42 applies by way of recurrence (*anuvattana* = Skt anuvtti) and since the use of the word ā*desa* (substitute) is enunciated in the nominative, the substituend *abhi* is to be stated in the genitive, as the *vuttikāra* does. But then he continues by explaining that it is possible to take *abhi* as a genitive with elided genitive suffix on the interpretation of Kacc 221 (+ 220)
stating that prefixes do not have any case markers.252 This, however, is an extreme case of commentarial ingenuity. On the other hand, Vajirabuddhi's exegetical practice shows that he regards Kacc as a synchronous system of rules from which it is possible to pick any rule that can be used to explain any given form.

§111. Usually Vajirabuddhi makes use of well-known exegetical devices, which he defines in connection with the exegesis of Kacc-v 48:
pati etassa sare vā byañjane vā pare kvaci paṭi ā*deso hoti*: "before a following vowel or consonant paṭi is sometimes substituted for *pati".* Since the interpretation *sare vā byañjane v*ā is not warranted by Kacc 252Mmd 56,24–26 : sareggahaṇassânuvattanato ādesaggahaṇassa paṭhamāya niddiṭṭhattā abhissā ti vattabbe abhisaddaṃ (so read) chaṭṭhiṃ katvā.

48 which only states that in some cases *paṭi* is substituted for *pati*,
Vajirabuddhi takes the opportunity of explaining how certain governing rules either apply in the manner of a jumping frog (*maṇḍūkagatika*, cf. 

Skt maṇḍū*kagati*), i.e., from a preceding rule to the rule in question, or in the manner of the lion's gait (sī*hagatika*, cf. Skt siṃ*hâvalokitanyāya*), 
i.e., from the immediately preceding rule to the rule in question. This makes it possible to explain the interpretation of the vuttikāra with reference to Kacc 42: *go sare* etc. (*maṇḍūkagativasena*), and Kacc 49 puthass' u byañjane (sī*hagativasena*).

253 It is, of course, questionable if this analysis represents the actual intention of the *vuttikāra*, but it illustrates the tendency of Mmd to exhaust every possibility of explaining Kacc-v as consistently based upon Kacc.

## Iv.3.2. Mmd Commentaries And Grammars Based Upon Mmd

§112. When Chapaṭa wrote Kacc-nidd, presumably in the first half of the fifteenth century A.D., several works related to Mmd were in circulation. Thus he quotes two passages from Nyāsaṭīkā, which are identical with passages in Mmd-pṭ, 254 as well as Nyāsappadīpappakaraṇa,255 and Nyāsappadīpaṭīkā, 256 of which a fragment is still extant.257
§113. Gv 63 attributes a Mahāṭīkā on Mmd to Vimalabuddhi (= Vajirabuddhi) which may be identical with Mmd-pṭ. Nothing is known about the authors of the other two works. Since they antedate Kacc-nidd, they may have been composed in the twelfth century A.D.

## Pāli Grammar And Grammarians 121

§114. Mukhamattasāra, 258 "The Essence of Mmd", is attributed to Guṇasāgara who is also credited with a ṭīkā on his work.259 It may have been composed in the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D.

260 Chapaṭa quotes two verses from Mukhamattasāra261 which he notices are composed under the influence of Vimalabuddhi,262 as well as a prose passage.263 A late work like Vijitāvī's Kaccāyanavaṇṇanā (Kacc-vaṇṇ)
(sixteenth century A.D.) is to a large extent an abbreviated recast of Mmd and should therefore be included among the grammars written in the tradition of Mmd.
