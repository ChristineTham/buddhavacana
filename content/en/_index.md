<p>This website documents my journey reading and studying Buddhist texts, primarily from the Pāli Canon (Tipiṭaka). It also contains a textbook and other references for learning Pāli, the language that the Tipiṭaka is written in.</p>

We do not know what the Buddha's native language was. Some scholars have speculated that it was either Magadhi or Magadhi-Prakrit considering his family background and where he was born. The Buddha probably preached the Dhamma in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Buddhist teachings were preserved and transmitted orally, and modern scholars believe over time Pāli evolved as a mix of the above languages, with the meanings of some words adapted to have specific Buddhist significance. As such, Pāli is a partially invented language used for the transmission and preservation of Buddhist theology, and is the canonical language of Buddhism.

I have always wanted to study Buddhism, and in particular the Pāli Canon or Tipiṭaka, in Pāli rather than translated into English. This website summarises what I have learnt. I have tried to use diagrams such as mind maps whenever possible, and link to the actual discourses are available on [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net).
