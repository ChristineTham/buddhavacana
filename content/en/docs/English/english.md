## Grammatical levels

```plantuml
@startebnf
grammar = { sentence  (* unit of language *) }- ;

sentence = { clause (* word or phrase forming all or part of sentence *) }- ;
clause = { phrase (* group of words based on headword *) }- ;
phrase = { word (* self contained units of meaning *) }- ;
word = { morpheme (* lowest unit of language that can convey meaning *) }- ;
@endebnf
```

  while their mother made the tea."):5

```

## Words

```plantuml
@startebnf
word = content_word (* words that carry the meaning of the sentence *) |
  structure_word (* words that hold the sentence together *) ;
content_word =
  noun (* eg. "children" *) | 
  verb (* eg. "watched" *) |
  adjective (* eg. "green" *) |
  adverb (* eg. "slowly" *) ;
structure_word =
  pronoun (* eg. "they" *) |
  conjunction (* eg. "while" *) |
  preposition (* eg. "beside" *) |
  determiner (* eg. "the" *) ;
@endebnf
```

## Types of Clauses

```plantuml
@startebnf
clause = declarative (* making statements*) |
  interrogative (* asking questions *) |
  imperative (* making commands and requests *) |
  exclamative (* making exclamations *) ;
@endebnf
```

## Clause patterns

```plantuml
@startebnf
clause = Subject (* about X *), Predicate (* What about X? *);
clause = (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*hesitated*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*stabbed*) , Object (*Polonius*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*was*)  , Complement (*solitary*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*gave*) , indirect_object (*people*)  , direct_object (*surprises*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*drove*) , Object (*Ophelia*) , Complement (*mad*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*went*) , Adverbial (*away*) ) |
  (Subject (*Hamlet*) , Verb (*put*) , Object (*the sword*) , Adverbial (*down*) ) ;
predicate = Verb , ( Object , [Complement | Adverbial] | Complement | (indirect_object , direct_object) | Adverbial ) ;
Subject = noun |
  pronoun |
  noun_phrase ;
  (* topic *)
Verb = action | state | link (* to Complement or Adverbial *) ;
  (* develop the Subject *)
Object = noun |
  pronoun |
  noun_phrase ;
  (* person, thing or idea affected by action of Verb *)
Complement = noun |
  pronoun |
  noun_phrase |
  adjective |
  adjective_phrase ;
  (* refers to Subject *)
@endebnf
```

Note: `verb` and `Verb` are not the same. `verb` is a type of word, `Verb` is part of a clause (along with `Subject` and `Object`).

## Nouns

```plantuml
@startebnf
(* person, thing, idea *)
noun = proper_noun (* people, places or things *) |
  common_noun | gerund (* Verbal noun *);
common_noun = countable_noun (* have singular and plural forms *) |
  uncountable_noun (* abstract ideas, or things considered in the mass *) ;
@endebnf
```

## Pronouns

```plantuml
@startebnf
(* reference to noun phrase, general idea or nothing ("dummy Subject") *)
pronoun = personal_pronoun (* reference to previous or upcoming noun phrase *) |
  possessive_pronoun (* belong to person or thing referred to *) |
  reflexive_pronoun (* Subject and Object are the same *) |
  demonstrative_pronoun (* reference by distance *) |
  indefinite_pronoun (* reference, general to vague *) |
  interrogative_pronoun (* used in questions *) |
  relative_pronoun (* used to form relative clauses *) ;
@endebnf
```
