  A brief introduction to Linguistics and Theoretical Grammar

## Linguistics

Linguistics is the study of languages. It has three major subdisciplines:

1. **Phonology** - the study of how sounds are used a language;
2. **Lexicology** - the study of the meaning and structure of words in a language;
3. **Grammar** - the study of the rules for using and combining words into sentences.

Grammar in turn is concerned with two primary sets of rules

1. **Morphology** - how words are constructed from their constituents;
2. **Syntax** - how words are combined to form sentences.

Morphology considers the paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships between words:

1. **Syntagmatic** relations are based on the relationship between words in a linear sequence (such as the order of words in a sentence)
2. **Paradigmatic** relations consider words that are similar (in terms of meaning, form, or function) and can be substituted for each other in a sentence.

## History of Linguistics

Writing using cuneiform on clay tables was invented in ancient Babylonia over 4000 years ago.

One of the earliest examples of comprehensive linguistics originated in ancient India, due to the need to correctly recite and interpret the Vedic texts, which were composed in Vedic Sanskrit.

According to [Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyākaraṇa):

>**Vyākaraṇa** (Sanskrit: व्याकरण, lit. 'explanation, analysis', IPA: [ˈʋjaːkɐrɐɳɐ]) refers to one of the six ancient Vedangas, ancillary science connected with the Vedas, which are scriptures in Hinduism. Vyākaraṇa is the study of grammar and linguistic analysis in Sanskrit language.

Pāṇini (6th century BCE) wrote a rule-based description of the Sanskrit language in his **Aṣṭādhyāyī** ("Eight Chapters"). Pāṇini described over 4000 rules (`sutra`s) for generating words so that they can be used in sentences, describing the semantic role of words in sentences, as well as listing about 2000 roots that can be used to form words.

Linguistics and Grammar for present day Indo-European languages can be traced back to the ancient Greeks and the Romans, in the works of Dionysius Thrax, Protagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Varro, and Priscian. The term grammar is derived from the Greek word `grammatikē`, where `gram` meant something written. The part `tikē` derives from `technē` and meant "art". Hence `grammatikē` is the art of writing.

Traditional English Grammar was based on Latin Grammar, and was intended to be prescriptive (articulating the rules for correct usage). The most influential grammar of this period was R. Lowth’s **Short Introduction to English Grammar** (1762).

In the 20th century, linguistics evolved to become a systematic description of the structure of a language, based on work done by Leonard Bloomfield and others. The focus of linguistics moved from prescriptive to descriptive (analysing and describing how language is actually used). Noam Chomsky advocated a transformative-generative approach to grammar, by regarding grammar as a domain specific system containing a theoretical set of rules that can generate all possible sentences in a given language. There are some resemblances between Pāṇini's rules to the rewrite rules proposed by Chomsky.

Chomsky and other researchers then went on to propose that knowledge of grammar is "innate" in human beings and there is a "universal grammar" that we inherit rather than learn.

Most recently, the development of large language models show that it is possible to achieve general purpose language generation and classification through training an artificial neural network. Current models are largely based on a decoder only transformer based architecture.

## Evolution of English Grammar

As mentioned above, traditional English grammar originated as an adaptation of Latin grammar, and was *prescriptive*. This culminated in the 19th century with works such as C.P. Mason’s **English Grammar** (1858) and A. Bain’s **Higher English Grammar** (1863).

Henry Sweet started the transition away from descriptive grammar to *non-structural descriptive*, via his book **New English Grammar, Logical and Historical** (1891). The term "scientific grammar" became popular to refer to a reliance on facts and the use of the inductive method. Otto Jespersen in **The Philosophy of Grammar** (1924) is based on three principles of classification (meaning, form, and function) and proposes the concept of ranks distinguished in nexus (predication) and junction (subordination).

Leonard Bloomfield in **Language** (1933) sought to study the structure of a language as objectively as possible, without reference to meaning and other languages. For example, four devices are used in English to indicate structural meaning: 1) word form; 2) function words; 3) word order; 4) intonation and accent patterns (prosodic patterns). Structural grammarians used formal methods of linguistic analysis, such as immediate constituent, distribution, substitution, transformation (deletion, permutation, etc.). Parse tree diagrams were used to illustrate immediate constituent analyses and to show the syntagmatic interrelations between the sentence constituent.

Next, English grammar transitioned from structural descriptive to transformational (Zellig Harris) and transformational-generative (Noam Chomsky) approaches in 1960s. In subsequent years, refinements include:

* Phrase structure grammar (late 1970s)
  * Generalised phrase structure grammar (late 1970s)
    * Head-driven phrase structure grammar (1985)
    * Principles and parameters grammar (Government and binding theory) (1980s)
* Lexical functional grammar
* Categorial grammar (lambda calculus)
* Minimalist program-based grammar (1993)

Theoretical English grammar gives an analysis of the structures in the light of general principles of linguistics and the existing schools and approaches.

In this period of time, English itself has evolved as a language, away from it's parent Anglo-Saxon.

>What used to be expressed by inflected noun forms is now expressed either by means of prepositions, i.e. lexically, or by a special position in the sentence or the word-combination, i.e. syntactically. The greatest changes of all can be seen in the adjective and the verb. The elaborate declension system of the adjective has completely disintegrated, and the adjective is now an invariable part of speech (not mentioning degrees of comparison). To quote B. Ilyish (1973:307), “the simplification of adjective morphology had to be ‘paid for’ by limitation of freedom in word order”. The verb has undergone radical changes as well: personal inflexions, with the exception of the singular 3rd person present tense inflexion, have been lost; new tense forms have come into being: present-day English now boasts of 16 tense forms against two in Anglo-Saxon. To innovations we should attribute the passive forms, the analytic forms of the subjunctive mood, and others. All these modifications have changed the structure of English: present-day English is generally described as an analytic language.

In post-structural linguistics parts of speech are discriminated on the basis of three criteria: semantic, formal and functional.

## Language structure (hierarchy of grammatical units)

| Level | Term | Description |
| --: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | phoneme | form, but no meaning |
| 2 | morpheme | smallest meaningful element, abstract and significative |
| 3 | lexeme | nominative lingual units with meaning |
| 4 | phraseme | complex nomination of various referents in a sentence |
