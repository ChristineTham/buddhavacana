## Introduction

>Traditional grammar has its origins in the principles formulated by the scholars of Ancient Greece and Rome. (Valeika, 2003, p. 8)

### Prescriptive grammar

Early English grammars were modelled after Latin grammar, and were prescriptive (concerned with rules for the correct use of English). One of the earliest, and well-known, example of this is (Lowth 1762) which states in p. x:

>The principal design of a Grammar of any Language is to teach us to express ourselves with propriety in that Language, and to be able to judge of every phrase and form of construction, whether it be right or not. The plain way of doing this, is to lay down rules, and to illustrate them by examples. But besides shewing what is right, the matter may be further explained by pointing out what is wrong.

The notion of "right" and "wrong" is based on Latin, and therefore does not necessarily describe English as it was commonly used.

According to (Valeika, 2003, p. 12):

>... prescriptive grammar could be characterized by the following features:
>
>1. Patterning after Latin in classifying words into word classes and establishing grammatical categories;
>2. Reliance on meaning and function in definitions;
>3. Approach to correctness: the standards of correctness are logic, which was identified with Latin, and the past.
>4. Emphasis on writing rather than speech.
