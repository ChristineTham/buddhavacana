Here is the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

## Apaccataddhita

232. **Vāṇapacce.**

When words ending in the sixth (case ending) denote the meaning of "descendant of that (person)," the suffix *ṇo* or *vā* is used. *Vā* here refers to the meaning within the sentence. Since the suffix *ṇo* has already been mentioned in the context of denoting descendants, the word "descendant" (*apacca*) is not used separately.

In the phrase "Tesaṃ vibhatyā," the phrase "tesaṃ" implies the elision of the case ending (*vibhatti*). The same applies in other similar contexts.

In "Tesaṃ ṇo lopaṃ," the *ṇ* of the suffix is elided.

In "Vuddhādisarassa vā saṃyogantassa saṇe ce," when followed by the letter *saṇ*, the initial vowel of a word that ends in a conjunct and starts with a vowel undergoes modification (*vuddhi*).

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

## Patronymic Suffix

232. **In the sense of offspring.**

Optionally, the suffix 'ṇa' is added to words ending in the sixth case (genitive) to express the meaning "offspring of that."

The word 'vā' (optionally) indicates the sense of the sentence. Since the meaning of offspring is expressed by 'ṇa' alone, the word 'apacca' (offspring) is not used.

By the rule "Tesaṃ vibhatyā," the case ending is elided due to the word 'tesaṃ' (of those). This applies to the following rules as well.

By the rule "Tesaṃ ṇo lopaṃ," the 'ṇ' of the suffix is elided.

By the rule "Vuddhādisarassa vā saṃyogantassa saṇe ce," when followed by 'sa' and 'ṇa', there is lengthening (vuddhi) of the initial vowel of the base that doesn't end in a conjunct consonant.

The exceptions to this are as follows:

#### ChatGPT

The rule you've provided is a classical Pali grammatical rule, which can be translated into English as follows:

---

**"The elongation of vowels (vuddhi) in the case of 'a' and other vowels."**

- The vowels 'a', 'i', and 'u', when elongated, become 'ā', 'e', and 'o' respectively. The word "ca" in the rule indicates that sometimes this elongation does not occur.
- When there is deletion of a vowel or other phonetic modifications, and when a word is formed as a noun (due to suffixes like 'taddhita'), it should be treated as a noun.
- The gender, case, and number of the word formed through the taddhita suffix should be determined accordingly.
- When something is formed through the collective sense (samūhabhāva), it is more likely to be neuter.
- The suffix 'ṇya' is used in the sense of something that belongs to or is related to a particular subject, and it results in a neuter form.
- The particles 'tā', 'tu', and 'thiyaṃ' are used as suffixes, and they modify the meaning of the word they are attached to.
- A descendant of the sage Vasiṭṭha is called 'Vāsiṭṭha' for a male, 'Vāsiṭṭhī' for a female, and 'Vāsiṭṭhaṃ' for a neuter noun. Because of the optional nature of suffixation, a compound formed with a taddhita suffix might result in the word 'Vāsiṭṭhā' being used even in the neuter gender.
- The experts in linguistics (Pali grammar) know this rule.

This translation captures the essence of the Pali grammatical rule you provided, explaining vowel elongation (vuddhi), suffixation (taddhita), and the formation of gendered and neuter forms in Pali.

#### Claude

Here's an English translation and explanation of the Pali grammatical rule:

"Ayuvaṇṇānañcāyo vuddhi" - The vowels a and i are lengthened (to ā and ī respectively).

"Akārivaṇṇuvaṇṇānaṃ āeovuddhiyo honti, casaddena kvaci na" - The vowels a, i, and u are lengthened to ā, e, and o respectively. The word "ca" (and) indicates that this rule doesn't always apply.

"Saralopādi, taddhitattā nāmamiva kate syādi" - Vowel elision and other rules apply; when forming taddhita derivatives, they behave like nouns.

"Taddhitābhidheyyaliṅga–vibhattivacanā siyuṃ" - Taddhita derivatives take on the gender, case, and number of what they denote.

"Samūhabhāvajā bhīyo, sakatthe ṇyo napuṃsake" - Collective and abstract nouns are common; the suffix -ṇya is used for neuter nouns with the same meaning.

"Tā tutthiyaṃ nipātā te, dhāmithaṃpaccayantakā" - These are indeclinables in the third case, ending in suffixes like -dhā, -thā, etc.

"Vasiṭṭhassāpaccaṃ poso vāsiṭṭho, itthī vāsiṭṭhī, napuṃsakaṃ vāsiṭṭhaṃ" - A male descendant of Vasiṭṭha is vāsiṭṭha, a female is vāsiṭṭhī, and the neuter form is vāsiṭṭhaṃ.

"Vikappavidhānato taddhitena samāsassāccantaṃ bādhāyā bhāvā vasiṭṭhā paccantipi hoti" - Due to the optional rule, the compound form vasiṭṭhāpacca can also be used instead of the taddhita derivative.

"Napuṃsakena vāpīti, saddasatthavidū viduṃ" - Grammarians know that the neuter form can also be used.

This rule explains the formation and usage of taddhita derivatives, particularly those related to patronymics and other familial relationships, along with their grammatical behavior.

#### ChatGPT

The passage you provided is a Pali grammatical rule along with explanations. Here's a translation of the rule into English:

---

**233. "Vā" refers to an alternative or additional meaning.**

**Ṇāyana and ṇāna stem from the root "vacchā" and others.**

When a term is derived from the clan (gottagaṇa) beginning with "vacchā," it can take either the form "ṇāyana" or "ṇāna." The derivation applies to descendants from a specific lineage (apacca), starting from the offspring (paputta) and downward. For example, a descendant of Kacca is referred to as "Kaccāyana" or simply "Kaccāna." Due to the presence of a conjunct consonant, there is no vowel lengthening (vuddhi).

**234. "Ṇeyyo" refers to terms like "Kattikā" and others.**

The term "ṇeyyo" is used for a descendant of Vinatā, which can be either "Venateyyo" or "Vinateyyo." There is no vowel lengthening (vuddhi) in this context. The term "ṇeyyo" can also be used in a compounded sense (yogavibhāgena) with the meaning "to be given to him" (tassa dīyate), as in "dakkhiṇeyyo," meaning "one to whom a gift (dakkhiṇā) is given."

---

This translation captures the core ideas of the grammatical rules described in the Pali text, explaining how certain suffixes and forms are used in relation to clan names and descendants, and how they influence the formation of words.

#### Claude

Here's the translation and explanation of the Pali grammatical rule:

233. The word "vā" (optionally) is understood, and this is a governing rule.

**The suffixes -ṇāyana and -ṇāna are added after vaccha and similar words.**

Optionally, the suffixes -ṇāyana and -ṇāna are added after the group of words beginning with vaccha to form patronymics.

A patronymic (apaccaṃ) refers to descendants starting from a grandson. For example: The descendant of Kacca is Kaccāyana or Kaccāna. There is no vowel lengthening due to the final consonant cluster.

234. As stated in the rule "ṇeyyo is used after words like kattika," the suffix -ṇeyya is added. For example: The descendant of Vinatā is Venateyya or Vinateyya. In the alternative form, there is no vowel lengthening. By separating the components of the rule, -ṇeyya can also be used in the sense of "that to whom something is given." For instance: One to whom a gift (dakkhiṇā) is given is called Dakkhiṇeyya.

236. ‘‘Ṇavo  pagvādīhī’’ ti ṇavo. Manuno apaccaṃ māṇavo.

237. ‘‘Ṇera  vidhavādito’’ti ṇero, sāmaṇero.

#### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's the English translation of the Pali grammatical rule:

---

**235. "Ato ṇi vā."**

When a word ends in 'a', the affix ṇi can optionally be added to form a descendant or a diminutive form. The "vā" (meaning "or" or "optionally") indicates that the ṇi affix is not mandatory and can be omitted. The affix ṇi can also be applied to words ending in other vowels besides 'a'.

Examples include:
- **Dakkhi** (a descendant of the Dakṣiṇa lineage)
- **Sakyaputtiko** (a descendant of the Sakya clan)
- **Maṇḍabbo** (a diminutive form of Maṇḍapa)
- **Bhātubbo** (a diminutive form related to "brother" or "bhātu").

"Dvittaṃ" indicates that the forms are dual in nature, referring to both the original and the derived forms.

**236. "Ṇavo pagvādīhī" ti ṇavo.**

The affix ṇava is used with words related to the descendants of Manu, thereby forming the word **Māṇava**, meaning "descendant of Manu" or "a youth."

**237. "Ṇera vidhavādito" ti ṇero.**

The affix ṇera is used in contexts such as with the word "vidhavā" (widow) and others to signify a diminutive or a descendant. For example, **Sāmaṇero** (a novice monk) is derived in this way.

--- 

This translation provides an understanding of how these Pali affixes (ṇi, ṇava, ṇera) are used in forming words that indicate descendants or diminutive forms.

#### Claude

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

235. **Optionally, -ṇi is added after stems ending in -a.**

The suffix -ṇi is optionally added to form patronymics from stems ending in -a. Additionally, due to the word 'vā' (optionally), the suffix -ṇika can also be used. For stems ending in -a and those not ending in -a, the suffix -ba is also possible.

Examples: 
- Dakkhi
- Sakyaputtiko
- Maṇḍabbo
- Bhātubbo

Note: Doubling (of consonants) occurs.

236. As per the rule "Ṇavo pagvādīhi," the suffix -ṇava is used. For example, māṇava (a young Brahmin) is derived from manu (man).

237. As per the rule "Ṇera vidhavādito," the suffix -ṇera is used. For example, sāmaṇera (novice monk).

#### ChatGPT

The Pali grammatical rule you provided discusses the formation of various types of derived words using specific suffixes, focusing on the nuances of meaning and application. Here’s a translation and explanation:

---

**Saṃsaṭṭhādi-anekattha-taddhita**

**238.** "Where something is mixed, crosses, moves, or carries, the suffix *ṇika* is applied" — This is the *ṇika* suffix. When the suffix is added with a change in vowel (*vā*), it can have multiple meanings and multiple affixes.

For example:

- **Ghatena saṃsaṭṭho ghātiko, odano**: Mixed with *ghata* (ghee), it becomes *ghātika* (rice mixed with ghee), indicating something associated with *ghata*.
  
- **Uḷūpena taratīti oḷūpiko, uḷūpiko vā**: Crossing with a raft (*uḷūpa*), it becomes *oḷūpika* or *uḷūpika* (one who crosses using a raft). There is no vowel lengthening (*vuddhi*) in this case.
  
- **Sakaṭena caratīti sākaṭiko**: Traveling by cart (*sakaṭa*), it becomes *sākaṭika* (one who travels by cart).
  
- **Sīsena vahatīti sīsiko, na vuddhi**: Carrying with the head (*sīsa*), it becomes *sīsika* (one who carries on the head), with no vowel lengthening.

For feminine gender (*itthiliṅga*), the suffixes *eyyaka* and *ṇaka* are used:

- **Campāyaṃ jāto campeyyako**: Born in Campā, it becomes *campeyyaka*. Similarly, for other cities, like *bārāṇaseyyaka* for someone from Bārāṇasi.
  
- **Kusinārāyaṃ vasatīti kosinārako**: Living in Kusinārā, it becomes *kosināraka*.

For names of regions (*janapada*), the suffix *ṇaka* is used:

- **Magadhesu vasati, tesaṃ issaro vā māgadhako**: Living in Magadha, or the ruler of Magadha, it becomes *māgadhaka*.

When indicating a specific type or excellence (*visiṭṭhatthe tajjātiyā*), the suffix *ājānīya* is used:

- **Assajātiyā visiṭṭho assājānīyo**: The best of the horse breed is called *assājānīya*.

The suffix *ño* is used to indicate something that is to be known or recognized:

- **Agganti jānitabbaṃ aggaññaṃ**: Something to be known as supreme is called *aggañña*.

- **Dvittaṃ**: A pair or something that comes in twos.

---

This rule outlines how different suffixes are used in Pali grammar to form words that convey specific meanings based on association, origin, or excellence.

#### Claude

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

238. "The suffix -ṇika is added to denote 'mixed with,' 'crosses by,' 'moves by,' or 'carries by.'" The letter 'vā' (or) indicates multiple meanings and multiple suffixes.

Examples:
- Ghātika: mixed with ghee (as in rice)
- Oḷūpika or uḷūpika: one who crosses by raft (no vowel lengthening in the latter)
- Sākaṭika: one who travels by cart
- Sīsika: one who carries on the head (no vowel lengthening)

From feminine bases, -eyyaka and -ṇaka are used:
- Campeyyaka: born in Campā
- Bārāṇaseyyaka: of Benares
- Kosināraka: one who lives in Kusinārā

From names of countries, -ṇaka is used:
- Māgadhaka: one who lives in Magadha or the ruler of Magadha

To denote excellence in a particular species:
- Ājānīya: as in assājānīya (thoroughbred horse)

The suffix -ñña (with doubling of the preceding consonant) is used to mean "to be known as":
- Aggañña: to be known as the foremost

#### ChatGPT

The Pali grammatical rule you provided can be translated into English as follows:

---

**239.** **Regarding the meanings of study, action done by someone, proximity, command, art or craft, livelihood, etc.:**

When the terms like "taṃ adhīte" (meaning "studies that"), etc., and also in contexts like "hatā" (meaning "killed"), the suffix "ṇika" can be added. For example, "abhidhammam adhīte" (one who studies Abhidhamma) becomes "ābhidhammika" or "abhidhammika" (a student of Abhidhamma). In some cases, there is an increase in the vowel. 

An action done by speech ("vacasā kataṃ kammaṃ") is called "vācasikaṃ" (verbal). Similarly, "mānasikaṃ" (mental). In this context, the rule "sa sare vāgamo" applies, adding a vowel before the consonants in the derivative words.

When something is related to the body ("sarīre sannidhānā vedanā"), it is called "sārīrikā" (bodily). Someone appointed at a door ("dvāre niyutto") is called "dovāriko" (doorkeeper). Here, the rule "māyūnamāgamo ṭhāne" adds a "v" before the "o".

**Sippa** (art or craft) refers to skills like singing, etc. If someone possesses the art of playing the vīṇā (a musical instrument), he is called "veṇiko" (vīṇā player). Here, "vīṇā" refers to vīṇāvādana (playing the vīṇā). Someone who deals in perfumes is called "gandhiko" (perfume seller). If someone lives by hunting on the road ("mage hantvā jīvatīti"), he is called "māgaviko" (hunter), with the addition of "v". 

A person killed by a net is called "jālika" (caught in a net), tied with a string is "suttiko" (tied with a string), one whose weapon is a bow is called "cāpiko" (archer), someone suffering from wind disease is "vātiko" (afflicted by wind), one who has faith in the Buddha is "buddhiko" (faithful towards Buddha), and goods bought with cloth is "vatthikaṃ" (goods made of cloth).

A person who has a pot as a measure ("kumbho assa parimāṇaṃ") is called "kumbhiko" (pot user). Someone who lives in or is born in Magadha is called "māgadhiko" (a resident of Magadha).

This translation captures the essence of the grammatical rule and examples provided in the original Pali text.

#### Claude

This Pali grammatical rule and its explanation can be translated into English as follows:

Rule 239: "The suffix -ika is optionally added in the senses of studying, made by, proximity, appointment, skill, goods, and livelihood."

Explanation:
The suffix -ika is optionally added to words in the senses of "studies that" and other meanings indicated by "ādi" (et cetera), as well as in the senses of "made by" and so on.

Examples:
1. One who studies Abhidhamma: ābhidhammiko or abhidhammiko (no vowel lengthening in the latter case)
2. Work done by speech: vācasikaṃ
3. Work done by mind: mānasikaṃ (here, "sa" is added before a vowel as per the rule "Sa sare vāgamo")
4. Sensation proximate to the body: sārīrikā
5. Appointed at the door: dovāriko (here, "o" is inserted before "v" as per the rule "māyūnamāgamo ṭhāne")

"Sippa" refers to skills like singing, etc.:
6. One whose skill is the lute: veṇiko (here, vīṇā means playing the lute)
7. One whose goods are perfumes: gandhiko
8. One who lives by hunting animals: māgaviko (with "v" inserted)
9. Caught by a net: jāliko
10. Bound by thread: suttiko
11. One whose weapon is a bow: cāpiko
12. One who has a wind-related illness: vātiko
13. One devoted to the Buddha: buddhiko
14. Goods bought with cloth: vatthikaṃ

15. One who deserves a pot's worth, or a collection of pots: kumbhiko
16. One who gambles with dice: akkhiko
17. One who lives in or is born in Magadha: māgadhiko

And so on.

#### ChatGPT

Here’s the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

---

**240. "Ṇa rāgā tena rattaṃ tassedamaññatthesu ca."**

When the word "rattaṃ" (colored) appears in meanings such as "tyādi" (etc.), the ṇa suffix may be used. An example is "kasāvena rattaṃ kāsāvaṃ" (colored by saffron becomes saffron-colored).

Similarly, this applies to colors like "nīlaṃ" (blue) and "pītaṃ" (yellow), etc. There is no vowel change (vuddhi) in such cases, as in "mahisassa idaṃ māhisaṃ" (māhisaṃ, the possession of a buffalo), where "siṅgaṃ" (horn) remains unchanged.

Similarly, in "rājaporisaṃ" (king's servant), vowel change (vuddhi) occurs again in the following compound word (uttarapada), as stated by the rule "ayuvaṇṇānañcā."

In "māgadho" (one who originates from Magadha, a Magadhan), it refers to someone born there, someone who is a lord of them, or someone who resides there. Similarly, "kattiko" (related to Kattika, a lunar month) means associated with Kattikā and other months.

"Buddho" (enlightened one) means one who is a deity. "Veyyākaraṇo" (a grammarian) refers to someone who has studied grammar thoroughly. In this case, as per the rule "māyūnamādinā," the "e" prefix is added before the "y" (yakārato) to form the word, and there is a double consonant (dvittaṃ) of the "y."

For example, "sāgaro" (ocean) refers to one born from the sea.

This translation captures the essence and examples provided in the original Pali rule, explaining the grammatical rules and their applications with relevant examples.

#### Claude

Here's an English translation of the Pali grammatical rule and its explanation:

Rule 240: "The suffix -ṇa is used in the sense of 'colored by that,' 'this belongs to that,' and in other meanings."

Explanation:
1. The suffix -ṇa is optionally used in the sense of "colored by that" and similar meanings. For example, "kāsāvaṃ" means "colored with saffron."

2. Similarly, this applies to words like nīla (blue), pīta (yellow), etc. There is no vowel strengthening (vuddhi). For instance, "māhisaṃ" means "this belongs to a buffalo," referring to its horn.

3. In "rājaporisaṃ" (belonging to the king's men), there is vowel strengthening of the latter part due to the rule "ayuvaṇṇānañcā."

4. The suffix is also used in the sense of "coming from," "born there," "their lord," or "this is their dwelling." For example, "māgadho" can mean someone from Magadha, born there, their lord, or dwelling there.

5. It's used with months, like "kattiko" for the month associated with the Kattikā constellation.

6. In "buddho," it means "Buddha is his deity."

7. In "veyyākaraṇo" (grammarian), there's an insertion of 'e' before 'ya' and doubling of 'ya' according to specific rules.

8. "Sāgaro" means "born from the ocean," etc.

#### ChatGPT

The Pali grammatical rule can be translated into English as follows:

**241. For words beginning with "jāta" and similar words:**

For words like *jāta* (born), the suffixes *imo*, *iyo*, and by the conjunction *ca*, *kiyo* are used. For example, *pacchā jāto* (born later) becomes *pacchimo* or *pacchiyo*. *Manussajātiyā jāto* (born in the human race) becomes *manussajātiyo*. Similarly, *ante niyutto* (fixed at the end) becomes *antimo* or *antiyo*. In the same way, *andhakiyo* (related to blindness). *Putto assa atthī* (he has a son) becomes *puttimo* or *puttiyo*. In the same manner, *kappiyo* (proper, suitable) is formed.

**242. When the word ends in "ṭhānam" with the meaning of "tadassa":**

The suffix *īyo* is used, and by the conjunction *ca*, it also applies to expressions with the meaning of being beneficial (*hitādi*). For example, *bandhanassa ṭhānaṃ* (a place for binding) becomes *bandhanīyaṃ* and *caṅkamanassa hitaṃ* (beneficial for walking) becomes *caṅkamanīyaṃ*.

**243. For words with the meaning of being abundant:**

The suffix *ālu* is used. For example, *abhijjhābahulo* (abundant in desire) becomes *abhijjhālu*.

#### Claude

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rules into English:

241. **"The suffixes -ima and -iya are added to words like jāta, etc."**

For words like jāta and others, the suffixes -ima and -iya are added. The word 'ca' (and) in the rule also includes -kiya. For example:
- pacchā jāto (born later) becomes pacchimo
- manussajātiyā jāto (born in human race) becomes manussajātiyo
- ante niyutto (engaged at the end) becomes antimo or antiyo

Similarly, andhakiyo. 
"One who has a son" becomes puttimo or puttiyo. Similarly, kappiyo.

242. **"The suffix -īya is used to denote 'that is its place', and also for meanings like 'suitable for' etc."**

The suffix -īya is used to indicate "that is its place." The word 'ca' (and) in the rule extends its use to meanings like "suitable for" etc. For example:
- bandhanassa ṭhānaṃ (place of bondage) becomes bandhanīyaṃ
- caṅkamanassa hitaṃ (suitable for walking) becomes caṅkamanīyaṃ

243. **"The suffix -ālu is used to indicate abundance."**

The suffix -ālu is used to denote abundance. For example:
- abhijjhābahulo (full of covetousness) becomes abhijjhālu

### Visesataddhita

244. **Degrees of Comparison and Superlatives.**

In the sense of intensity, the suffixes like **tara** and others are used.

Here, these suffixes express an increase in intensity, such as **pāpa** (bad) becoming **pāpataro** (worse), **pāpatamo** (worst), **pāpissiko** (more wicked), **pāpiyo** (more evil), or **pāpiṭṭho** (most evil).

For words referring to an elder, as in the phrase "Vuddhassa jo iyiṭṭhesū," in the place of "vuddhassa" (elder), the suffixes modify the word by removing the vowel **a** from the base form, leading to forms like **jeyyo** (more victorious) or **jeṭṭho** (eldest).

Similarly, for words referring to someone praiseworthy, as in "Pasatthassa so ce," the suffixes modify the word to create forms like **seyyo** (better) or **seṭṭho** (best).

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

## Superlative and Comparative Suffixes

244. **In expressing distinction, the suffixes -tara, -tama, -issika, -iya, and -iṭṭha are used.**

These suffixes are used to express a higher degree or superiority.

For example: "This one is the most sinful among them" can be expressed as pāpataro, pāpatamo, pāpissiko, pāpiyo, or pāpiṭṭho.

According to the rule "vuddhassa jo iyiṭṭhesu" (the substitution of 'j' for the strengthened form in -iya and -iṭṭha), and due to the rule "saralopā" (vowel elision), but with the original form retained as per "pakatiggahaṇena," we get: jeyyo, jeṭṭho.

Similarly, according to the rule "pasatthassa so ce" (the substitution of 's' for the praiseworthy form), we get: seyyo, seṭṭho.

### Assatthitaddhita

245. **"Tadassatthīti vī ce" - Vī:** When something serves a purpose or meets a requirement, it is represented by the suffix "vī." For example, "medhā assa atthī" (one who has intelligence), becomes "medhāvī" (wise, intelligent).

246. **"Tapādito sī" - Sī:** Similar to the above, when something is derived from "tapa" (austerity) or similar roots, the suffix "sī" is used. For example, "tapa" becomes "tapassī" (an ascetic).

247. **"Daṇḍādito ika ī" - Ika, ī:** The suffixes "ika" and "ī" are used for words derived from "daṇḍa" (staff, punishment). For example, "daṇḍa" becomes "daṇḍika" (one who carries a staff) or "daṇḍī" (one who punishes).

248. **"Guṇādito vantū" - Vantu:** The suffix "vantu" is used for words derived from "guṇa" (virtue). For example, "guṇa" becomes "guṇavā" (virtuous), and "paññā" (wisdom) becomes "paññavā" (wise). Additionally, certain words may undergo shortening (rasso).

249. **"Satyādīhi mantū" - Mantu:** The suffix "mantu" is used for words derived from "sati" (mindfulness) or similar roots. For example, "sati" becomes "satimā" (mindful), and "bhānu" (sun) becomes "bhānumā" (radiant).

250. **"Āyussukārāsmantumhī" - Ussa, Asa:** For certain words, the suffix "ussa" or "asa" is used, as in "āyasmā" (venerable).

251. **"Saddhādito ṇa" - Ṇo:** The suffix "ṇo" is used for words derived from "saddhā" (faith). For example, "saddhā" becomes "saddho" (faithful).

252. **"Tappakativacane mayo" - Mayo:** The suffix "mayo" is used to indicate something made of a particular material. For example, "suvaṇṇa" (gold) becomes "sovaṇṇamayaṃ" (made of gold). Alternatively, "suvaṇṇamayaṃ" can also be used. In some cases, a vowel lengthening (vuddhi) occurs when combined with other elements.

**Etesamo lope:** When the case ending is dropped, for words like "mana," the suffix "o" is used. For example, "manomayaṃ" (mind-made).

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rules into English:

245. The suffix 'vī' is added to express possession. Example: 'medhāvī' (wise) means "one who possesses wisdom" (medhā).

246. Similarly, the suffix 'sī' is added after words ending in 'tapa', with doubling of the final consonant. Example: 'tapassī' (ascetic).

247. After words ending in 'daṇḍa', the suffixes 'ika' and 'ī' are added. Examples: 'daṇḍiko', 'daṇḍī' (one carrying a staff).

248. The suffix 'vantu' is added after words denoting qualities. Examples: 'guṇavā' (virtuous), 'paññavā' (wise). The vowel is shortened according to the rule beginning with 'yada'.

249. The suffix 'mantu' is added after words like 'sati' (mindfulness). Examples: 'satimā' (mindful), 'bhānumā' (radiant).

250. In the case of 'āyu' (life), 'u' becomes 'us' and 'as' before 'mantu'. Example: 'āyasmā' (venerable).

251. The suffix 'ṇa' is added after words like 'saddhā' (faith). Example: 'saddho' (faithful).

252. The suffix 'maya' is added to express "made of" or "consisting of". Example: 'suvaṇṇamayaṃ' or 'sovaṇṇamayaṃ' (made of gold). Optionally, there's vowel strengthening according to the rule beginning with 'yada'.

**When these suffixes are elided:**

When case endings are dropped, the final 'a' of words like 'mana' becomes 'o'. Example: 'manomayaṃ' (mind-made).
