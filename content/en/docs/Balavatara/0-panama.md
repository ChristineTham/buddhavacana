## Pali

### Ka

Sabbaṃ niruttipathapāragataṃ sabuddhaṃ,\
Buddhaṃ tilokatilakaṃ hatapāpadhammaṃ;\
Dhammaṃ vimuttisukhadaṃ vihatāghasaṃghaṃ,\
Saṃghaṃ ca niccamabhivandiya dakkhiṇeyyaṃ.

### Kha

Vuddhippattosmi muddho mama varagaravo sīlapaññādisobhe,\
Candādicceva suddhe varajinaṭhapite sāsanābbhe patīte;\
Nissāyevā tipemā paṇamiya sirasā niccamesaṃ saritvā,\
Pādambhoje guṇagge hataduritamalo ānubhāvena tassā.

### Ga

Porāṇa sīhaḷa padattha vinicchayañca,\
Sabbampi māgadhaniruttinayaṃ pasatthaṃ;\
Aññañca nekavidha sakkata saddasatthaṃ,\
Pāramparābhata matañca nisamma sammā.

### Gha

Bālāvatāra varamāgadha saddasatthe,\
Dubbodha nekapadaattha vinicchayena;\
Atthāya ādhunika bālaparamparāya,\
Bālāvatāra varagaṇṭhipadaṃ karissaṃ.

### Ṅa

Niccaṃ ye mettha bālā varahadayayutā suṭṭhu nikkhittanettā,\
Puṇṇe nānānayānaṃ suratarusadise dhīrapāsaṃsiye ve;\
Gambhīraṃ duttaraṃ te jinavacanudadhiṃ tiṇṇathāmā bhaveyyuṃ,\
Laddhopāyā ca candaṃ taditarapacuraṃ sakkataṃ sotukāmā.

### Ca

Ganthanipphattiyā sesa – dukkarattaṃ yathāvato;\
Jānanti kusalā dhīrā, nekasatthantarādisu;\
Ganthesu guṇadosampi, teyeva vidurā sadā.

### Cha

Tasmā ettha pamādādi – dosaleso bhave yadi;\
Porāṇāceraladdhīhi, vilomaṃ vā bhaveyya ce.

### Ja

Ganthantaraṃ vigāhetvā, vicāretvā punappunaṃ;\
Yuttimeva ca gaṇhantu, hutvā vīmaṃsabuddhikāti.

## English Translation

### A

Beyond the reach of words, all is fully enlightened,\
The Buddha, the supreme jewel of the three worlds, eradicator of suffering's stain;\
The Dhamma, granting the joy of freedom, dispelling the masses of defilements,\
And the Sangha, deserving perpetual reverence, worthy of offerings always.

### B

Alas, I am dull-witted, my discernment is veiled, my virtues and wisdom are flawed,\
Like the moon eclipsed by clouds, my character is tarnished, my teachings are defiled;\
Yet, I take refuge in the Triple Gem, I humbly bow my head, I constantly pay tribute,\
With the stain of misdeeds washed away, I stand in the radiant presence of the Enlightened One, pure and untainted.

### C

The ancient Sinhala language, its nuances and interpretations,\
Are fully comprehended through the Magadhan language and its articulation;\
Moreover, diverse languages, their phonetics and semantics,\
Are thoroughly grasped, and their ultimate essence is accurately discerned.

### D

The sublime Magadhan language, with its refined expressions,\
Is challenging to comprehend for some, due to its intricate subtleties;\
To facilitate understanding for contemporary novices and honor the traditional lineage,\
I will craft a gentle introduction, a gateway to comprehension.

### E

Always, those who are wise and compassionate, with gentle hearts and clear minds,\
Like full moons shining in various ways, with calm and peaceful demeanor;\
The deep and difficult ocean of the Buddha's teachings, with its threefold meaning,\
May be crossed with ease, and the moon of wisdom, with its cooling rays, be reached by those who yearn to hear.

### F

Completing the text is a challenging task, akin to reaching the end of a long journey;\
The wise and astute individuals recognize this, having studied various teachings and scriptures;\
They are also aware of the flaws in virtues, even within the texts themselves, and remain vigilant.

### G

Therefore, here, heedlessness and other defects may arise;\
If one is possessed by old habits, it may lead to a reversal (of progress).

### H

Having thoroughly analyzed the text, and having repeatedly investigated;\
They should precisely grasp the meaning, with a mind sharpened by critical inquiry.

## Homage

### 1. Buddhaṃ tidhā bhivanditvā, buddhambuja vilocanaṃ (Having praised the Buddha three times, the lotus-eyed Buddha)

> Bālāvatāraṃ bhāsissaṃ, bālānaṃ buddhivuddhiyā.
