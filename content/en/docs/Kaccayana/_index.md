## Introduction

**Kaccāyana** is the oldest extant Pāli grammar, and was composed around the sixth century CE, most probably in India. It is partly based on **Pāṇini** and **Kātantra**:

* Pāṇini, *Aṣṭādhyāyī* “Eight Lessons” 5th–4th c. B.C.E. Śalātura Northwest India
* Śarvavarman, *Kātantravyākaraṇa* 2nd c. C.E. South India

The author of **Kaccāyana** is attributed to Mahā Kaccāyana, but modern scholars believe it is authored by multiple compilers and gradually evolved over time. According to D'Alwis:

* the grammatical aphorisms (`sutta`), are ascribed to a certain Kaccāyana,
* the "gloss" or explanation (`vutti`) is ascribed to a certain Saṅghanandin
* the examples (`payoga`) is ascribed to a certain Brahmadatta

According to the Thai monk Dhammakitti in **Saddhammasaṅgaha** (Saddhamma-s IX, 18-20, 35):

>`kaccāyano kato yogo saṃghanandi pavuttikā, ṭīkā vimalabodhī ca brahmaputto ca kārakā.`  
>*(SADDHĀNANDA, 1890: 63)*  
>Kaccāyana composed the yoga [“rule”], Saṅghanandin the pavuttikā [“notes”], and Vimalabodhī the ṭīkā [“commentary”], and Brahmaputto the kāraka [“section on factor of action”].
