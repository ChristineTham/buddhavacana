The light of the thousand pure truths,\
The fragrance of the Buddha’s enlightenment,\

Having bowed down to Kaccāyana the Teacher,  
Supporting Kaccāyana commentary as a starting point;  
I myself will compose uprightly for the benefit of the foolish and ignorant,  
The Padarūpasiddhi which has distinguished and good chapters.

## Introduction

**Rūpasiddhi** (also called **Padarūpasiddhi**, **Rūpasiddhipakaṇaṁ**, **Mahārūpasiddhi**, and **Rūpasiddhi-aṭṭhakathā**) is a Pāli grammar by Buddhappiya (or Dīpankara) Thera, written sometime in the 13th century.

It is based on Kaccāyana's grammar, but reorders the rules (some rules have been deleted, and others added).

`rūpasiddhi` means the derivation of a word into it's final form by combining the root or the stem with various prefixes and affixes and word endings.
The scope of the book is the words contained in Buddha's teachings, so the book provides rules that describe how each word in Buddha's teachings can be derived.

The version of the Rūpasiddhi used in this translation is based on the authenticated Tipitaka texts from the [Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana CD](https://tipitaka.org/chattha.html) published by the [Vipassana Research Institute](http://www.vridhamma.org/Home.aspx).
