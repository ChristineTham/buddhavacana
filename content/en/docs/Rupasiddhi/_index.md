## Ganthārambha (Introduction)

“To the pure, true, enduring ray of Dhamma,\
To the noble Buddha, the bearer of enlightenment;\
The Victor, the Triple Awakened sun in the field,\
And to the Sangha of the true Dhamma, I bow my head.”

### [Kha]

The light of the thousand pure truths,\
The fragrance of the Buddha’s enlightenment,\
The sun in the field of the Buddha, the Victorious One,\
Having bowed my head to the noble Saṅgha of the true Dhamma,

[Kha]

“Having paid homage to the teacher Kaccāyana,\
Relying on the Kaccāyana commentary and others;\
I will straighten even the young and ignorant,\
Through the well organised and clear chapters of the **Padarūpasiddhi**.”

### ChatGPT

Here is the translation of the given Pali verse into English:

**[Ka]**
Bowing my head to the Buddha, the Jina (Conqueror), who is like the sun in the field of the three Buddhas, whose pure and true teachings shine with a thousand rays, who is the peak of enlightenment and the support of the world;

**[Kha]**
Having paid homage to the teacher Kaccāyana, and relying on the Kaccāyana grammar commentary, I will make an effort to produce this work, clear and straightforward, for the enlightenment of the ignorant, and to achieve the mastery of word formations.

### Claude

Here's a translation of the Pali verses into English:

[Ka]

I respectfully bow my head to the Victor (Buddha),
Who radiates a thousand rays of the pure true Dhamma,
Who rose like the sun of perfect enlightenment,
The sole sun in the field of the three Buddhas,
Along with the Dhamma and the Sangha.

[Kha]

Having paid homage to the teacher Kaccāyana,
And relying on the commentary of Kaccāyana and others,
For the enlightenment of the inexperienced,
I will compose a clear and well-structured
"Padarūpasiddhi" (treatise on the formation of words).

Note: This translation attempts to convey the meaning while maintaining some of the poetic structure. The verses appear to be an invocation and declaration of intent for composing a grammatical treatise, likely the "Padarūpasiddhi," a work on Pali grammar.

## Preface

**Rūpasiddhi** (also called **Padarūpasiddhi**, **Rūpasiddhipakaṇaṁ**, **Mahārūpasiddhi**, and **Rūpasiddhi-aṭṭhakathā**) is a Pāli grammar by Buddhappiya (or Dīpankara) Thera, written sometime in the 13th century.

It is based on Kaccāyana's grammar, but reorders the rules (some rules have been deleted, and others added).

`rūpasiddhi` means the derivation of a word into it's final form by combining the root or the stem with various prefixes and affixes and word endings.
The scope of the book is the words contained in Buddha's teachings, so the book provides rules that describe how each word in Buddha's teachings can be derived.

The version of the Rūpasiddhi used in this translation is based on the authenticated Tipitaka texts from the [Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana CD](https://tipitaka.org/chattha.html) published by the [Vipassana Research Institute](http://www.vridhamma.org/Home.aspx).
