Here is the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

**"Now, the different meanings of the case endings will be explained."**

Therein, the term "case endings" (vibhattī) refers to those that differentiate a single meaning based on factors like action (kamma) and number (singular/plural). These case endings, such as the nominative and others, are classified into seven types.

**(The text continues:)** "In which meaning does the nominative (paṭhamā) occur?"

### Claude

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

Now, the different meanings of the case endings are explained.

Among these, the case endings, starting with 'si' (nominative), are called 'vibhatti' because they divide a single meaning based on factors such as the object (kamma) and based on singularity, etc. These are sevenfold, beginning with the first (nominative).

In this context, in what sense is the first (nominative) case used?

Explanation:
1. The passage introduces an explanation of case endings (vibhatti) in Pali grammar.
2. It explains that case endings divide or specify the meaning of a word based on its grammatical function (like object) and number (singular, plural, etc.).
3. It states that there are seven cases, starting with the first case (paṭhamā), which is the nominative.
4. The last line poses a rhetorical question about the usage of the nominative case, likely to be answered in the subsequent text.

This appears to be the beginning of a detailed explanation of Pali case system in a grammatical treatise.

The first case-ending is for the mere indication of gender.

The meaning of gender is the meaning of gender. Herein, the gender is the limb, the hidden part. For the first thing to be placed in the case of the names of the noun-stems that are the counterparts of sounds produced for the purpose of distinguishing the natural cause, etc., of such words as “man,” etc., is the hidden part, because it is not evident, and because it is a part. Or else, it is called “gender” because the meaning of the gender is the meaning of the hidden part, because of the connection with the meaning of the three kinds of gender, which are the characteristics of the absence of clarity, the absence of obscurity, and the absence of both, and because of the connection with the meaning of the upasagga, etc., which are the synonyms of that. Or else, it is called “gender” because of the connection with the gender, or because of the connection with the gender as a name, or because of the connection with the gender as a synonym, according to the statement “The gender is the meaning of the noun-stem, which is excluded from the element, the cause, and the case-ending.”

The meaning of gender is the meaning of the word, which is called the “fourteenfold characteristic of the individual,” and which is the distinction of the aggregate, the continuity, etc., that cannot be expressed by the distinction of the individual and the other, when it is conceived by means of the elements, such as the earth element, the contact, etc., which occur by means of the special bond, and the meaning of the word, such as “pot,” “cloth,” etc., which is called the “fourteenfold characteristic of the individual,” and which is the common characteristic of the individual, which is the opposite of the dissimilar individual, and which is the common characteristic of the similar individual, and which is the characteristic of the hardness, the touch, etc., which is established by the superimposition according to the convention, of the individual elements, such as the earth element, the contact, etc., which are distinguished by the distinction of the place, the time, etc.

But it is of two kinds, associated with a verb, etc., and pure. Herein, the meaning of a word that is free from association with a verb, etc., and is associated with gender, number, and measure, and is the meaning of a word that is the basis for the addition of a case-ending, etc., is the meaning of a word that is pure.

But the meaning that is associated with a verb, etc., and is expressed by the three kinds of compound, namely, the appositional, the appositional-with-a-verb, and the appositional-with-a-noun, is also the first kind of meaning, because it is not the province of the second, etc., and because it is possible for it to be only the meaning of a word that is gender.

Herein,

The first is used in the sense of “together with,” in the sense of “hair,” in the sense of “falling,”
and in the sense of “action” in the case of the pure and the impure.

In the case of the gender, first, “this man,” “these men,” “this girl,” “these girls,” “this mind,” “these minds.”

In the case of number, “one,” “two.”

In the case of measure, “a doṇa,” “a khārika,” “a āḷhaka.”

In the case of the mere being of the seven, excluding gender, etc., “I,” “we,” “there is,” “there are,” “it is possible,” “it is impossible.”

“The first is used in the sense of gender” is a rule of addition. “And in the sense of addressing” is in the sense of addressing. Addressing is speaking to someone face to face.

Herein, addressing is the making face to face of one who already has a form by means of a sound. But when he is already made face to face, he is joined to an action by means of such words as “Go.” Therefore, since there is no joining to an action at the time of addressing, this does not get the name of a case.

And it is said:

>“The making face to face\
>of one who exists\
>by means of a sound\
>is addressing. There is no ‘king’ in ‘there is.’ ”\
>\
>“Come, friend, come, friends, come, gentlemen, come, friends, come, gentlemen.”

In what sense is the second case used?

#### ChatGPT 4o

### Translation of the Pali Grammatical Rule:

**283. "Liṅgatthe paṭhamā."**

In the context of gender, the nominative case (paṭhamā vibhatti) is used.

**Explanation:**

When referring to the meaning of "gender" (liṅgassa attho), the term "liṅgattho" is used. Here, "liṅga" refers to something that is subtle or not clearly visible, such as an indistinct part (avayava). For example, in grammatical classifications related to words like "purisa" (man), "pakatippaccaya" (original affix), etc., the initially established basic form that is not explicitly clear is called "liṅga" due to its subtlety and indistinctness. Alternatively, the term "liṅga" can also refer to the three types of gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) which are associated with meanings that are subtle and difficult to define. This includes meanings that are independent of prefixes and other affixes, as well as those that are derived from the root and suffix with a specific gender in mind. Therefore, in this context, "liṅga" refers to the basic form of a word that is to be declined (pāṭipadika), and this is indicated by the nominative case (paṭhamā vibhatti).

**Further Explanation:**

The meaning associated with "gender" (liṅgassa attho) includes various forms such as those related to groups, sequences, etc., that are indicated by forms like "ghaṭa" (pot) or "paṭa" (cloth). It also includes meanings related to the inherent nature of elements like the earth element or touch, which are recognized as conventional realities (paññatti) and are differentiated by time, place, etc. These meanings, when associated with actions or functions (kamma), are classified as either "pure" (suddho) or "mixed with other conditions" (kammādisaṃsaṭṭho). The "pure" meaning refers to the simple association with gender, number, and other aspects, while the "mixed" meaning involves more complex associations.

When the meaning of a word is expressed through the nominative case, it includes both the simple gender-related meanings and those associated with actions or other functions. Examples include sentences like "eso puriso" (this man), "ete purisā" (these men), "esā kaññā" (this girl), "etā kaññāyo" (these girls), "etaṃ cittaṃ" (this mind), and "etāni cittāni" (these minds).

Additionally, the nominative case is used when referring to numbers (sasaṅkhye) like "eko" (one) and "dve" (two), as well as when indicating quantities (saparimāṇe) like "doṇo" (a measure), "khārī" (another measure), and "āḷhakaṃ" (yet another measure).

In cases where gender is not involved (liṅgādivinimutte), such as with terms like "sattāmatte" (mere beings), the nominative case is used as well. Examples include sentences like "ca vā ha ahaṃ" (and I am) or "atthi sakkālabbhā" (there is a proper time).

The nominative case is also used in direct address (ālapana), as indicated by the rule "ālapane cā." This involves addressing someone directly, such as in "Bho purisa ehi" (O man, come here) or "Bho purisā vā" (O men, come here).

In summary, the nominative case is used both for indicating the subject in a sentence and for addressing someone directly, but it does not involve any action or function (kriyā) in the context of direct address.

**Question:**

In what context is the accusative case (dutiyā) used?

#### Claude 3.5 sonnet

Here's a translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

283. The first case (nominative) is used for the meaning of the stem.

The first case ending is used to express the mere meaning of the stem.

The meaning of the stem is called liṅgattha. Here, liṅga refers to the hidden or non-obvious element. For words like "purisa" (man), the basic form that is to be established first, before adding case endings and other affixes, is called liṅga because it is not obvious and is a component.

Alternatively, liṅga can be understood as that which has the threefold gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), or as the base form of a word before adding case endings.

The meaning of the stem (liṅgattha) refers to:
1. The conventional meaning of words like "pot" or "cloth", which are conceptual constructs based on form and other qualities.
2. The general characteristics of ultimate realities like earth-element or contact, which are common to the same type of phenomena but differ in time and place.

This meaning can be either pure or mixed with other factors like action. Here, liṅgattha refers to the pure meaning, without connection to action etc., and including number and measure.

The first case is used for:
- The pure meaning of the stem
- Some meanings of prefixes and indeclinables
- Even meanings involving action etc. when expressed by verbal derivatives, secondary derivatives, or compounds

Examples:
- With gender: eso puriso (this man), esā kaññā (this girl), etaṃ cittaṃ (this mind)
- With number: eko (one), dve (two)
- With measure: doṇo (a doṇa measure), khārī (a khārī measure)
- Mere existence: atthi (there is), sakkā (possible)

The first case is also used for address (ālapana), which means calling someone's attention.

The second case (accusative) is used for what purpose?

### 284.Kammatthe dutiyā (The second case is for the purpose of action)

> Kammatthe liṅgamhā dutiyāvibhatti hoti.

The second case is for the purpose of action.

> Anabhihite evāyaṃ, ‘‘kammani dutiyāyaṃ tto’’ti vacanañcettha ñāpakaṃ.

The word “action” is a guide here, because the rule is stated thus: “The second case is for action.”

> Kiṃ kammaṃ?

What is action?

> ‘‘Yena vā kayirate taṃ karaṇa’’nti ito ‘‘vā’’ti vattate.

The word “action” is used here in the sense of “that by which something is done.”

#### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

---

**284. The second case (accusative) is used to indicate the object.**

The accusative case ending is applied to the noun to indicate the object (kamma).

This rule is applicable only when the verb is not explicitly mentioned (anabhihita). The phrase "in the object, the second case (accusative) is used" indicates this usage.

What is the object?

The statement "that by which something is done is the instrumental case" continues from here, with the word "vā" (or).

---

This rule explains when and how the accusative case should be used in Pali grammar, particularly in situations where the verb is implied rather than explicitly stated.

#### Claude

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

284. The second case (accusative) is used for the object.

The second case ending is used with a stem to denote the object.

This applies only when the object is not expressed by other means. The statement "tto is used in the second case for the object" serves as an indicator here.

What is an object?

From the rule "That by which something is done is called an instrument," the word "or" is understood to continue.

Some explanatory notes:
1. This rule describes the use of the accusative case in Pali grammar.
2. It states that the accusative case is used to denote the direct object of a verb.
3. The rule specifies that this applies when the object is not already expressed through other grammatical means.
4. The mention of "tto" refers to a specific grammatical ending used in certain contexts.
5. The last part is referencing another grammatical rule about instruments, suggesting that there's some overlap or connection between objects and instruments in Pali grammar.

Whatever he does, or causes to be done, or attains, that is the agent.

Here the gender, tense, and case endings are omitted. The word “kamma” is derived from the root “kar” in the sense of “doing.” The agent is the doer, the performer, the cause of the action. The agent is of six kinds: deed, doer, instrument, accomplishment, object, and means. Herein, the verbal expression “agent” is established in the sense of “doing” only when there is a deed, etc., either in the sense of the nature of the deed, etc., or in the sense of the assumption of the deed, etc.

The deed is of three kinds: that which is to be produced, that which is to be transformed, and that which is to be attained. For example: “The mother gives birth to the son,” “Food produces happiness,” “Devadatta makes a pot,” “Devadatta makes charcoal from wood,” “He makes a bracelet or a ring from gold,” “He reaps rice,” “Devadatta enters the house,” “He sees the sun,” “He hears the Dhamma,” “He pays homage to the wise.”

And it is said:

>“It is said to be of three kinds, by way of origination, change, and occurrence;\
>It is the action that is the means of accomplishing the action, the handle of the axe of happiness.”

And here, in the case of the words “what he does is kamma,” the kamma is not considered as being of the kind that is desired or undesired, or as being of the kind that is spoken of or not spoken of, etc.; it is kamma in the sense of being all-inclusive. And in all these cases the kamma is kamma only in the sense of being the object of the assumption of a meaning other than the literal one.

Herein, undesired kamma is such as “he digs up a thorn,” “he swallows poison,” “he goes to a village and comes to the foot of a tree.”

Kamma that is not spoken of is such as “he asks for a blanket from Yaññadatta.” Herein, the kamma that is spoken of is the blanket, because it is the more important of the two, the asking and the giving. The kamma that is not spoken of is “Yaññadatta,” because it is not the main thing. So too, “he begs for wealth that is well stored,” “he leads a goat to the village,” “he asks the Blessed One,” “the Blessed One said this to the bhikkhus,” etc.

But it is not so in the case of kamma that is expressed, as in “a cart is being made by Devadatta,” “the Dhamma is taught by the Well-farer,” “a blanket is being asked for by a brāhmaṇa from Yaññadatta,” etc.

The second, the second.

#### ChatGPT

The Pali grammatical rule can be translated into English as follows:

---

**285. "What one does, that is the action."**

*Whether one does, transforms, or attains something, that which is the agent becomes known as the action.*

Here, there is no consideration of gender, tense, or number. The term "kamma" (action) is derived from "karoti" (to do). There, "kāraka" (agent) is the cause that brings about the action, and this agent is classified into six types: action, doer, instrument, recipient, source, and location. Among these, the classification of agent is determined by the presence of one of the six "kārakas" (roles), since the existence of the action depends on the presence of these roles.

Furthermore, this action is of three kinds: producing, transforming, and attaining. For example, a mother gives birth to a son, food produces happiness, Devadatta makes a pot, transforms wood into charcoal, makes a bracelet or a ring from gold, and cuts down rice. Devadatta enters a house, sees the sun, hears the Dhamma, and attends to the wise.

As it is said:

*"Divided into three by production, transformation, and attainment;
That action, combined with the agent, yields happiness, firewood, and a house."*

And here, without considering whether the action is desired, undesired, expressed, or unexpressed, and covering all cases, it is stated as "What one does, that is the action." Because of the possibility of alternative meanings and the extension of the application, this term "kamma" (action) applies universally.

In the case of undesired action, for example, one treads on a thorn, swallows poison, or while going to a village, approaches the root of a tree.

In the case of unexpressed action, for example, a Brahmin asks Yaññadatta for a blanket. Here, "blanket" is the expressed action due to the desire to attain it through the action of asking, while "Yaññadatta," being less important, is the unexpressed action. Similarly, one begs for wealth that is already obtained, takes a goat to the village, questions a person who is in decline, we ask Gotama, or the Blessed One says to the monks, and so on.

In the case of explicitly stated action, it is not considered as an action, such as: "A mat is made by Devadatta," "The Dhamma is taught by the Sugata," or "Yaññadatta is asked for a blanket by the Brahmin," and so on.

*"Dutiyā"* (the second case) refers to the instrumental case.

--- 

This translation conveys the Pali grammatical rule by explaining how actions are classified and understood in terms of their roles and effects.

#### Claude

Here's an English translation of the Pali grammatical rule:

285. That which one does is the object.

Whatever one does, whatever one modifies, or whatever one attains, that factor is called the object.

Here, gender, tense, and number are not considered. That which is done is called the object. There, the doer, the instrument, the accomplisher, is called the cause for the completion of the action. That factor is sixfold: object, agent, instrument, recipient, ablative, and locative. Among these, when there is an object, etc., either inherently or conceptually, the usage of the six factors is established due to the existence of the action.

That object is threefold: to be produced, to be modified, and to be attained. For example:
- A mother gives birth to a son; food generates happiness.
- Devadatta makes a pot; he turns wood into charcoal; he makes gold into a bracelet or a bangle; he reaps rice.
- Devadatta enters a house; he sees the sun; he listens to the Dhamma; he attends to the wise.

It is said:
"The object is considered threefold: production, modification, and attainment;
It is approached by the agent's action, like happiness, charcoal, and house."

Here, without considering distinctions such as desired or undesired, stated or unstated, etc., it is said "that which one does is the object" as an all-inclusive statement. Due to the option of different meanings and the scope of application, this definition of object applies everywhere.

There, an undesired object is like: treading on a thorn, swallowing poison, approaching the foot of a tree while going to a village.

An unstated object is like: The brahmin asks Yaññadatta for a blanket. Here, "blanket" is the stated object as it's more desired in the dual-object action of asking. "Yaññadatta" is the unstated object as it's less prominent. Similarly: He begs for abundant wealth; he leads the goat to the village; we ask Gotama about the failing man; the Blessed One said this to the monks, etc.

However, it doesn't apply to the expressed object, such as: The mat is made by Devadatta; the Dhamma is taught by the Buddha; Yaññadatta is asked for a blanket by the brahmin, etc.

"Second case" is understood.

### Translation of Pali Grammatical Rule 286 into English:

### 286. Gati, buddhi, bhuja, paṭha, hara, kara, sayādi, and similar verbs in the causative form.

When verbs like **gamu** (to go) in the sense of motion, **budha** (to awaken) in the sense of teaching or understanding, **bhuja** (to protect, to govern, or to eat), **paṭha** (to recite or to teach), **hara** (to take away), **kara** (to make or to do), and **si** (to sleep) are used in a causative sense, where the agent causing the action (causative agent) is different from the one performing the action, the object (kamma) takes either the accusative (second case) or, optionally, the instrumental (third case) form. 

This rule applies particularly when the action is habitual or customary (niccasampatte). Therefore, in such cases, the third case (instrumental) may be used instead of the second (accusative).

For example:
- "A certain person goes to the village, and another person causes him to go." This can be expressed as **"Puriso purisaṃ gāmaṃ gamayati"** (The person causes another person to go to the village) or **"Purisena vā gāmaṃ gamayati"** (The person causes another person to go to the village, using the instrumental case).
- Similarly, **"Evaṃ sissaṃ dhammaṃ bodheti ācariyo"** (The teacher causes the student to understand the Dhamma), **"Mātā puttaṃ bhojanaṃ bhojayati"** (The mother causes the son to eat), **"Sissaṃ dhammaṃ pāṭheti ācariyo"** (The teacher causes the student to recite the Dhamma), **"Puriso purisaṃ bhāraṃ hāreti"** (The person causes another person to carry the burden), and **"Puriso purisaṃ kammaṃ kārayati"** (The person causes another person to do the work) or **"Purisena vā kammaṃ kārāpayati"** (The person causes another person to do the work, using the instrumental case), **"Puriso purisaṃ sayāpayati"** (The person causes another person to sleep). In all these cases, the object of the causative action takes the second (accusative) case.

What does "causative" mean? For example, **"Puriso gāmaṃ gacchati"** (A person goes to the village).

When the action is not explicitly stated, it is not expressed as "Puriso purisaṃ gāmaṃ gamīyate" (The person is made to go to the village by another person), **"Sisso dhammaṃ bodhīyate"** (The student is made to understand the Dhamma), etc.

Here's the translation of the Pali grammatical rule into English:

### 286. Optionally, in causative constructions with verbs like "go," "understand," "eat," "recite," "carry," "do," "lie down," and others.

For verbs such as "gamu" (to go), "budha" (to understand or perceive), "bhuja" (to eat or enjoy), "paṭha" (to recite), "hara" (to carry), "kara" (to do), "si" (to lie down), and others of similar nature, when used in causative constructions, the object of the causative action (which is the agent of the original action) may optionally take the accusative case ending. This rule is optional because it's already established as obligatory; thus, in the alternative, the instrumental case is used.

Examples:
- A person causes another to go to the village: "Puriso purisaṃ gāmaṃ gamayati" (accusative) or "Purisena gāmaṃ gamayati" (instrumental).
- Similarly: A teacher makes a student understand the Dhamma, a mother makes her son eat food, a teacher makes a student recite the Dhamma, a person makes another carry a load, a person makes another do work, a person makes another lie down.

In all these causative constructions, the accusative case is used for the object of causation (original agent).

This rule applies only to causatives. For non-causatives: "Puriso gāmaṃ gacchati" (A person goes to the village).

This rule doesn't apply when the verb is in passive voice: "Purisena puriso gāmaṃ gamīyate" (A person is made to go to the village by another person), "Sisso dhammaṃ bodhīyate" (A student is made to understand the Dhamma), etc.

#### ChatGPT

### 287. In the Case of Temporal Adverbials in Close Connection.

"Accantaṃ" means uninterrupted or continuous, and "saṃyoga" means connection; hence, "accantasaṃyogo" refers to an uninterrupted or continuous connection. When temporal adverbials are in close connection with qualities, actions, or substances in an uninterrupted manner, the temporal adverbials take the second case (accusative case).

For example, in the context of time:
- "Sattāhaṃ gavapānaṃ" (seven days for the drinking of cows),
- "Māsaṃ maṃsodanaṃ" (a month for the offering of meat),
- "Saradaṃ ramaṇīyā nadī" (the river is pleasant during autumn),
- "Sabbakālaṃ ramaṇīyaṃ nandanaṃ" (Nandana is pleasant at all times),
- "Māsaṃ sajjhāyati" (he studies for a month),
- "Tayo māse abhidhammaṃ desesi" (he taught Abhidhamma for three months).

In the context of duration or distance:
- "Yojanaṃ vanarāji" (a stretch of forest for a yojana),
- "Yojanaṃ dīgho pabbato" (the mountain is a yojana long),
- "Kosaṃ sajjhāyati" (he studies for a kos).

What is meant by "accantasaṃyoge"?
- "Māse māse bhuñjati" (he eats every month),
- "Yojane yojane vihāraṃ patiṭṭhāpesi" (he established monasteries at every yojana).

#### Claude

Translation of the Pali grammatical rule:

### 287. In case of complete connection with time or distance.

Complete connection means uninterrupted connection. When there is a complete connection of time or distance with substances, qualities, or actions, the second case (accusative) is used with words denoting time or distance.

For time, examples are:
- Drinking cow's milk for seven days
- Eating meat and rice for a month
- The river is pleasant during autumn
- Nandana (garden) is pleasant all the time
- He recites for a month
- He taught Abhidhamma for three months

For distance, examples are:
- A row of trees for a yojana (a unit of distance)
- The mountain is long for a yojana
- He recites for a kosa (another unit of distance)

Why is "complete connection" specified? To distinguish from cases like:
- He eats every month
- He established a monastery every yojana

In these last examples, the action is repeated rather than continuous, so the second case is not used.

### English Translation of the Pali Grammatical Rule

**288. Concerning the Rule of Kammappavacanīya Usage.**

When a combination occurs with kammappavacanīya particles, the second case (accusative) is used due to the connection with gender.

Those elements which have a direct object as their primary reference are called kammappavacanīya, or alternatively, particles such as *anu*, and others are considered kammappavacanīya in their respective contexts.

In this context, the term *anu* is designated as kammappavacanīya when it denotes a sign, association, or inferiority. For example, in the sentences: "They went forth after the one who ordained," "The city of Bārāṇasī is situated by the river," and "tied with the river," the word *anu* is used in the sense of "following," "in connection with," or "with," respectively.

In the cases of signs, etc., the particles *pati*, *pari*, and *anu* are recognized as kammappavacanīya. Examples include "Divine beings might appear just before the sunrise," "The moon shines upon the tree," with *pati* in the sense of "before" or "towards," and similarly with *pari* and *anu*.

In the context of expressing a condition, "Devadatta is kind to his mother," the terms *pati*, *pari*, and *anu* are used in a similar way.

In the sense of parts, "Whatever part there may be for me, let it be given to me," the terms *pati*, *pari*, and *anu* are employed.

In cases of proximity, the word *pati* is used, as in "The moon shines upon each and every tree," with similar usage for *pari* and *anu*.

Additionally, the term *abhi* in a similar context of parts, such as in "To the noble Gotama, such a good reputation has arisen," and "Devadatta is kind to his mother," where *abhi* denotes a similar relation.

In the case of particles, such as *dhi* in the phrase "Dhi upon the killer of a Brāhmaṇa," and similar expressions, the rule applies.

---

This translation provides an understanding of the grammatical rule concerning the use of *kammappavacanīya* particles, their connection with the accusative case, and their application in various contexts within Pali grammar.

#### Claude

Here's the English translation of the Pali grammatical rule:

### 288. With Kammappavacanīya (Accusative-Denoting Words)

When used with kammappavacanīya indeclinables and prefixes, the second case (accusative) is used instead of the normal case.

Kammappavacanīya are those words that denote an object, or by convention, words like anu and others are called kammappavacanīya.

Among these, anu is designated as kammappavacanīya when it indicates a characteristic, accompaniment, or inferiority. For example: "They renounced after he renounced," "Benares is situated along the river," meaning "connected with the river," "Wise next to Sariputta."

For characteristics and others, pati, pari, and anu are designated as kammappavacanīya in the senses of characteristic, similarity, description, and distribution.

In characteristic: "Divine foods may appear in relation to sunrise," "The moon shines in relation to the tree," "around the tree," "along the tree."

In description: "Devadatta is good in relation to his mother," "around his mother," "following his mother."

In distribution: "Whatever might be my share, let it be given."

In separation: "The sound settles on each meaning," "The moon shines on each tree," "around each tree," "along each tree."

Abhi is designated as kammappavacanīya in all senses except distribution. "Indeed, such good fame has arisen about that Venerable Gotama," "Devadatta is good towards his mother."

With indeclinables: "Fie on the killer of a Brahmin," and so on.
