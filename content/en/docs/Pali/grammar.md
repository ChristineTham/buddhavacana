### 6. sāmivacana

Genitive case:

- may often be translated by "of", and serves as a "possessive" case
- denoting the "possessor" (sāmin)
- the whole of which the related word denotes a part (avayava)
- immediately precedes the word to which it relates
  - rañño thūpo
- A construction with a possessive genitive is very often equivalent to an English construction with the verb "to have"
  - idaṃ assa hoti
- "of him thus it is ..." (or was, etc.), "he has this thought ...", "he thinks thus ..."
  - tassa evaṃ hoti
- an idiom consisting of the genitive of the word denoting the period + accayena expresses the time after which (or through the passage of which) something is done:
  - sattāhassa accayena … pabbajissāma
- "after I have passed away", "after my death/parinibbāna"
  - mama + accayena = "after me"
- agent-genitive ("subjective genitive"):
  - brāhmaṇassa pūjito (Soṇadaṇḍo)
  - "(Soṇadaṇḍo was) honoured of (= by) the priest"
  - yesaṃ ... devā ...adiṭṭhā
  - "those ... who have not seen ... the gods (negative participle: a-)"
  - ("of (= by) whom the gods are unseen"; Commentary explains yesaṃ by yehi)
- patient-genitive ("objective genitive"):
  - ahaṃ … tassa yaññassa yājetā
  - "I ... (was) the performer of that sacrifice"
- substitute for the instrumental
  - kumbhiṃ ... pūraṃ ... suvaṇṇassa
  - "pot ... full ... of gold"
- used with certain indeclinables, such as:
  - piṭṭhito - "behind"
   purato - "before", "in front of"
   antarena - "between"
   me purato - "in front of me"
   kāyānam antarena - "between the bodies"
  - uttaraṃ nagarassa - "north of the city"
- The "genitive absolute" consists of a noun (or pronoun) followed by a participle, both inflected in the genitive. This nexus stands apart from the other words of the sentence and means "while (the noun was doing the participle)"
  - special sense of disregarding: "despite (the noun doing the participle)", "under their very noses," as when the participle means "seeing", "looking on"
  - telassa jhāyamānassa "as (while) the oil is burning"
  - mātāpitunnaṃ … rudantānaṃ … pabbajito "though his parents were weeping, he went forth" (i.e. "despite their weeping")
- useful for constructing a sentence with two agents, but the similarly constructed locative absolute (Lesson 16) is much more frequently used

### 8. āmantaṇavacana, ālapanavacana

Vocative:

- used "enclitically", i.e. it does not stand at the beginning of a sentence

## guṇanāma

Adjective:

- When an adjective is common to two or more nouns it may agree with the sum of these (and be plural) or with the nearest. Thirdly the qualified words may be taken as collective and singular and the adjective be singular. Where the genders conflict, the masculine takes precedence over the feminine, the neuter over both.
- An adjective usually precedes the noun it qualifies, but when there are several adjectives with one noun very often only one adjective precedes and the rest follow the noun.
- A demonstrative pronoun relating to the same noun will precede the whole group.
- When an adjective, or (all the) adjectives, follows its noun this usually indicates that it is being "predicated" of the noun, or in other words that the attribute in question is being emphasized.

## sabbanāma

Pronouns

### niyamita

Personal and Demonstrative (incomplete TBD)

- Although the person is expressed by the inflection of the verb, the pronouns of the first and second persons are frequently used, giving a slight emphasis to the subject. The third person pronoun is less often used in this way.
- The third personal pronoun is used also as a demonstrative, meaning "that", "it", in three genders.
- It is generally used as what is known as an "anaphoric " pronoun, that is to say it refers back to someone or something previously mentioned in a narrative.
- As opposed to the use in conversation and other direct speech of "pronouns of presence" referring to someone or something present ("this man", "that jar"), these pronouns are called "pronouns of absence" because it is most often used to speak of someone or something in a story and therefore not present to the listeners.
- It may serve to connect the sentences of a narrative into a continuous paragraph or longer section. It is used also as an emphatic pronoun (in combination with another pronoun or occasionally with 1st person, for example in the expression so 'haṃ "I" (literally "that I").
- In combination with a noun it is again emphatic and may sometimes be translated "the"
- There being no "definite article" in Pali the demonstrative pronouns are sometimes used where English would use the definite article, and may sometimes be translated "the" rather than "he", "that", "this", etc.
- Demonstrative pronouns must agree in number and gender (and case) with the nouns to which they refer.
