## CONCLUDING SUMMARY

This is a restatement of the above extracts from the words of the Buddha, with minor rearrangement, edits and clarifications to make the text flow better, and eliminating vocatives and repetition.

If you know and understand the Buddha’s teachings, you will not need to rely on the authority of teachers, repeat what they say, dependent on teachers, or engage in customs and rituals. Instead, your knowledge and understanding is known by yourself, seen by yourself, experienced by yourself, and the teaching of the Buddha is verifiable and should be personally experienced by those who are able to do so.

The Buddha’s teaching can be encapsulated as Four “Pure” Truths:

1. The pure truth of “dukkha” (suffering)
2. The pure truth of the source of dukkha
3. The pure truth of the end of dukkha
4. The pure truth of the path of progress, leading to the end of dukkha

### Dukkha

Dukkha is an underlying dissatisfaction caused by:

* birth (and rebirth)
* old age
* death
* grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble
* association with the disliked
* separation from the loved
* not getting what one desires

In summary, the dukkha is analogous to a continuously burning fire fed by the Five Masses of Fuel (“pañcupādānakkhandhā”).

### The Five Masses of Fuel

These are five processes:

1. rūpa (form),
2. vedanā (feelings),
3. saññā (perceptions),
4. saṅkhāra (volitional results),
5. viññāṇa (consciousness),

These processes result in:

* suffering,
* disease,
* body disfigurements,
* injury,
* trouble and misfortune,
* oppression,
* inflictions by others,
* disintegration,
* emptiness.

### Impermanence

Life, and everything that is experienced, is impermanent. Time passes, beings die (and are reborn), like water flowing in a stream, ever changing and moving. The impermanence of life is dukkha.

### No permanent “self” or “soul”

What we regard as a sense of “self” is also impermanent. Our conception of a “being” is nothing more than the collection of the Five Masses of Fuel, there is no “sum” that is greater than the “parts.”

There is suffering, but no “self” is suffering  
There is action, but no “self” is performing  
There is entinguishment, but no “self” is extinguishing  
There is a path, but no “self” is travelling.

### The source of dukkha.

Dukkha is caused by craving, leading to rebirth, accompanied by delight and desire, and experienced by one who takes delight here and there; thoroughly enjoying this and that:

* craving for sensual pleasure,
* craving for existence,
* craving for annihilation.

### The end of dukkha

Dukkha is ended by completely fading away and ending craving, and:

* giving up
* relinquishing
* liberation,
* non-attachment

### The path of progress leading to the end of dukkha

Also known as the Pure Path in Eight Parts (“ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo”), consisting of:

1. sammādiṭṭhi (right view),
2. sammāsaṅkappa (right intention),
3. sammāvāca (right speech),
4. sammākammanta (right conduct),
5. sammāājīva (right livelihood),
6. sammāvāyāma (right effort),
7. sammāsati (right awareness),
8. sammāsamādhi (right mental composure).

The basis of the Pure Path is the mind pulling away from the Five Masses of Fuel, which causes the fuel to be spent and the fire to stop burning. Let us examine some of these masses in greater detail.

### vedanā (Feelings)

There are three types of feelings, either relating to the body or to the mind:

1. pleasant feelings, with an underlying tendency towards desire
2. unpleasant feelings, with an underlying tendency towards aversion
3. neutral feelings, with an underlying tendency towards ignorance

These underlying tendencies - desire, aversion, ignorance - should be given up.

### sañña (Perceptions)

There are six types of perceptions:

1. perception of form,
2. perception of sound,
3. perception of smells,
4. perception of taste,
5. perception of touch,
6. perception of mental characteristics.

Sañña is the process of recognising “recognition.” And what is “recognition”? It is the ability to classify representations, for example colour (“blue”, “yellow”, “red”, “white”, etc.)

### saṅkhārā (Volitional Thought Processes)

There are three types of volitional thought processes:

1. bodily thought process (intention which result in bodily action),  
   eg. breathing in and out
2. verbal thought process (intention which result in verbal action),  
   eg. inner dialogue
3. mental thought process (intention which result in thought formation).  
   eg. sañña (perceptions) and vedanā (feelings)

There are six classes of volitional thoughts (intentions):

1. thoughts about forms,
2. thoughts about sounds,
3. thoughts about smells,
4. thoughts about tastes,
5. thoughts about contacts,
6. thoughts about mental characteristics.

### viññāṇa (Consciousness)

The following prerequisites or dependencies cause consciousness to arise, and be categorised:

* eye (faculty of seeing)  
  dependency of forms  
  categorised as “visual-consciousness”
* ear (faculty of hearing)  
  dependency of sounds  
  categorised as “auditory-consciousness”
* nose (faculty of smelling)  
  dependency of smells  
  categorised as “olfactory-consciousness”
* tongue (faculty of tasting)  
  dependency of taste  
  categorised as “gustatory-consciousness”
* body (faculty of touch)  
  dependency of physical sensations  
  categorised as “tactile-consciousness”
* mind (faculty of tought)  
  dependency of mental states  
  categorised as “mental-consciousness”

### bhava (Existence)

It is a fruit ripening in the realm of sensual desire. If there is no volitional action,  there would not be desire for existence.  
Action is the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving is the moisture.  
While beings are impeded by ignorance, bound by craving, fallen away from their roots, consciousness is well established and in the future produces renewed existence.

### Consciousness May Be Calmed

Whenever any suffering arises,  
All caused by consciousness;  
With the cessation of consciousness,  
There is no birth of suffering.

Having known this danger,  
suffering is caused by consciousness;  
The bhikkhu stills the consciousness,  
And so attained final Nibbāna satisfied.

### The Psychological Law Of Causality And Its Use

Having a cause is a condition for saññā (perceptions) arising and ceasing for a person.  
Practice arising a single perception, and ceasing a single perception.

### Liberation Is A Natural Process

For the moral and accomplished in virtue, nothing ought to be done with intention.

“May no regrets arise of me.”  
This characteristic, non-regret, arises for whoever is moral and accomplished in virtue.  
One who has no regrets, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May joy arise of me.”  
This characteristic, joy, is born for whoever has no regrets.  
One who is joyous, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May delight arise of me.”  
This characteristic, delight, arises for whoever is joyous.  
One who is delighted, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May my body calm down.”  
This characteristic, body, calms down for whoever is delighted.  
One of calm body, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May I experience happiness.”  
This characteristic, happiness, is experienced for whoever has a calm body.  
One is happy, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May my mind become composed.”  
This characteristic, mind, becomes composed for whoever is happy.  
One is composed, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May I see and know reality as it is.”  
This characteristic, reality as it is, is seen and known for whoever is composed.  
One who sees and know reality as it is, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May I be dispassionate and detached.”  
This characteristic, one becomes dispassionate and detached for whoever seeing and knowing reality as it is.  
One who becomes dispassionate and detached, has nothing that ought to be done with intention.

“May I personally realise understanding and insight into liberation.”  
This characteristic, one personally realises understanding and insight into liberation for whoever is dispassionate and detached.

### The Origin And Control Of Suffering

Visual consciousness (cakkhuviññāṇa) arises dependent on rūpa (form) and the faculty of seeing. The three combined together is phassa (contact).  
Dependent on phassa (contact), vedanā (feelings).  
Dependent on vedanā (feelings), taṇhā (craving).  
While completely fading away and ending of craving, cessation of grasping.  
From cessation of grasping, cessation of being.  
From cessation of being, cessation of birth.  
From cessation of birth, old age, grief, wailing, pain, suffering and trouble cease.  
Thus of this whole lot, there is cessation of mass of suffering.  
This is disappearance of dukkha (suffering).

### Everything Is Caused

Like a certain seed,  
Sown in field, grows;  
Meeting with soil nutrients,  
and moisture, both of these.

Thus, the masses and elements,  
And these six senses;  
Reason for arise of dependence,  
Disintegration of dependence, ceases

### Man Forms His Own Destiny

Irrigators guide water,  
Arrow makers straighten arrow;  
Carpenters straighten wood,  
The wise tames the self.

### Karma Sometimes Works Slowly

By no means completed wrong action,  
Thickens quickly like milk;  
Smouldering, heedlessly follows,  
Like fire covered with ashes.

### How Rebirth Is Influenced By Actions

Here, a certain person generates harmful intentions resulting in bodily, verbal and mental actions.  
Having generated harmful intentions resulting in bodily, verbal and mental actions, he is reborn in a harmful world.  
That being, who is reborn in a harmful world, is afflicted with harmful contact.  
That being, who is afflicted with harmful contact, experiences totally painful harmful feelings just like beings living in hell.

### A Strong Wish May Influence Rebirth

Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom.  
It occurred to him:  
“Oh dear, oh no, death (of my) body, following death, I should be reborn in company of wealthy men of the ruling caste.”  
He takes his mind, focuses and cultivates it.  
Regarding that, those volitional thought processes and state of mind, thus cultivated and practised often, leads to rebirth.  
This way, this path of progress leads to rebirth.

### A Summary Of The Way

Non-doing of all wrongdoing,  
Taking up of wholesome;  
Purifying one's own mind,  
This is the teaching of the Buddha.

### Renunciation

Formerly, I was similar to an ignorant being, living as a layman.  
Because of that, the Tathāgata and his disciples taught the Dhamma to me.  
Having heard that Dhamma, I acquired faith in the Tathāgata.  
I reflected like that, endowed with the the gaining of that faith.  
Household life is crowded and dirty, renunciation is open space.  
It is not easy from being settled in domestic living to living a completely perfect and flawless spiritual path.  
What if I were to renounce from household life to homeless state, having shaved off hair and heard, and having put on ochre robe.  
Indeed, friend, after some time, having left behind a small or large pile of wealth, and a small or large family circle, I renounced from household life to homeless state, having shaved off hair and heard, and having put on ochre robe.

### sammādiṭṭhi (Right View)

The bhikkhu:

* when walking knows clearly “I am walking”,
* when standing knows clearly “I am standing”,
* when sitting knows clearly “I am seating”,
* when lying down knows clearly “I am lying down.”

In whatever way his body is orientated, in that way he knows clearly.

He is aware of:
* observing the body internally, externally, internally and externally (together),
* contemplating the nature of arising, disappearance, arising and disappearing (together) of physical processes.

And for him he keeps in mind and establishes “there is a body”, and he is independent and mindful through understanding and continuous awareness, and he does not cling to anything in the world.

* mettā (goodwill/friendliness)
* karuṇā (compassion/pity)
* muditā (emphatic happiness)
* upekkhā (balance/equanimity)

### sammāsamādhi (Right Mental Composure)

Nine levels of mental composure:

1. Secluding oneself from sensual pleasures, detaching from unskillful behaviour, one enters and remains in the first jhāna, accompanied by reflection and consideration, secluded from defilements, with felicity and satisfaction. Of that, whatever past perceptions of sensual pleasure cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion.
2. With the conclusion of reflection and consideration, one enters and remains in the second jhāna, accompanied by an inner calming of intention, focused and free of thought or inner dialogue, born from stable mind, with felicity and satisfaction. Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of felicity and satisfaction born from seclusion cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure.
3. With the detachment from felicity, enters and remains in the third jhāna, one remains mentally balanced, is fully aware and being present, experiences body comfort, as the pure ones describe: “equanimous, attentive, living at ease.” Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of the felicity and satisfaction born from mental composure cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of equanimity, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of equanimity.
4. Just before the giving up of the pleasant and the unpleasant and the disappearance of mental pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, one enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, in a neutral state, and possessing purification of awareness by equanimity. Of that, whatever past refined and true perception of equanimity cease. In that occasion, there is refined and true perception of neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation, and in that occasion there is only a refined and true perception of neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensation.
5. Going beyond perception of form altogether, with the disappearance of perception of sense impressions, ignoring the recognition of multiple/diverse things, one enters and remains in the base of the infinity of space, ie. “infinite space”.
6. Going beyond the base of infinite space altogether, one enters and remains in the base of the infinite consciousness, ie. “infinite consciousness”.
7. Going beyond the base of infinite consciousness altogether, one enters and remains in the base of nothingness, ie. “there is nothing”.
8. Having seen the inadequacy of the base of neither perception nor non-perception that is practiced often, one applies oneself to expecting and attaining the ending of recognition and feeling.
9. Going beyond the base of neither perception nor non-perception altogether, one enters and remains in the ending of recognition and feeling, having seen by that knowledge, one arrives at the exhaustion of the effluents.

>And from whatever indeed, I entered and emerged from these nine attainments of the successive stages in mental composure forwards and backwards, then I claimed to the deities in the world, Māra, Brahmas, religious practitioners, general population, kings and commoners: “This is the highest, perfect awakening, and perfect enligtenment!”
>
>Having insight, the realisation arose for me: “Unshakeable is my mental liberation, this is the final birth, now there is no rebirth.”

### The State Of Emptiness

(After that, Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion in the late afternoon and approached the Bhagavant. Having approached, he bowed to the Bhagavant and sat down to one side.) The Bhagavant said this to Venerable Sāriputta sitting on one side:  
“You are tranquil indeed, Sāriputta, and your appearance is pure and complexion bright. How have you been spending time lately, Sāriputta?”  
“Lately, I often dwell on emptiness, Bhante.”  
“Excellent, Sāriputta. Truly, Sāriputta, lately you often dwell in the internal dwelling of an illustrious being. Sāriputta, this is the internal dwelling of an illustrious being: Emptiness.”

### How To Meet Persecution And Death

Friend, if others behave with unpleasantness, disagreeableness, dislikeableness to that bhikkhu - even hitting him with hands, stones, sticks, weapons. Thus he knows: This body is of such nature that it is possible to physically hit it with hands, stones, sticks, weapons.

But this is indeed said by the Bhagavant in the exhortation with the simile of the saw: “Bhikkhave, even if lowlife robbers cut off all the limbs with a doubled handled saw, even in that case whoever will corrupt his mind is not practising the teaching of mine. And now applied with me there will be active determination, presence and awareness, unmuddled, tranquility, unagitated body, composed and focused mind. And now certainly, even when hit by hands, stones, sticks, weapons in the body, surely in this case the teaching of the Buddha is practised.”

### A Bhikkhuni’s Story

Consumed by defilements,  
Pursuing beautiful perceptions;  
Did not obtain balance of mind,  
Slave of the impassioned heart.

Thin, pale, sickly,  
Seven years I wandered;  
By day or night I did not,  
Experience comfort, suffering miserably.

From that, having taken a rope,  
Entered into the inner forest;  
My wish is now suicide,  
But whatever deficiences will repeat again.

Having made a strong noose,  
Having tied to a branch of a tree;  
Placed noose on neck,  
Then my mind was liberated.

### The Buddha Relates How He Attained Nibbāna

From my own doing, I was liable to:

* birth
* old age
* sickness
* death
* sorrow
* defilement

Searching for the unsurpassed sanctuary of extinguishment from (birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, defilement), I achieved the unsurpassed sanctuary of (non birth, non-aging, health, non-death, non-sorrow, undefiled).

Having insight, the realisation arose for me: “Unshakeable is the my mental liberation, this is the final birth, now there is no rebirth.”

### Nibbāna

All passions abandoned by me,  
All ill will from the masses (of fuel);  
All my delusions gone,  
I am liberated and quenched.

### Nibbāna is satisfying

Certainly Nibbāna is very satisfying,  
Taught by the perfectly awakened one;  
Free from sorrow, a pure sanctuary,  
Whenever dukkha ceases.

### Nibbāna is within reach

In possibility of non-aging,  
What good in whatever from aging sensual pleasures for you?  
Seized by death and illness,  
All classes of beings wherever.

This is not aging, not subject to death,  
This is free from old age and death, and sorrow;  
Peaceful and unobstructed,  
Free from stumbling and fear.

This is achieved by many,  
Obtainable now this freedom from death;  
Whoever applies properly,  
Not able without striving.

### Nibbāna is a way out

There exists, that which is not born, not become, not made, not formed.  
From that, a way out of being born, becoming, made, formed can be clearly known.

### Nibbāna and death

Like a flame blown by a gust of wind,  
The essence runs away and approaches eluding definition;  
Thus a sage freed from representation and body,  
The essence runs away and approaches eluding definition.

There is no quantification of the disappeared,  
By whatever that is said, that is not for him;  
In eradicating every characteristic,  
All eradicated from even representation.
