In this book, references to Kaccāyana are denoted by eg. {8} (8th `sutta` or
"grammatical rule"). Altogether there are 675 suttas, which shows how compact
Kaccāyana is.

Pali, like most other Indo-Aryan languages, is an oral language spoken as
`vākya` (sentences) made up of `vacana` (words) which are a combination of
`akkhara` ("sounds", or "letters from an "alphabet"). {1}

There are debates about the origin of Pali, whether it was in fact a real language
actually spoken by people, as opposed to an "invented" language specifically
for the purposes of recording Buddhist doctrine. The term "Pali" actually
just means "text", and today "Pali" is used primarily for Buddhist literature.

## Pali Alphabet and pronunciation {2}-{9}

The Buddha may have spoken a language similar to Pali, and when he died his
sayings were collected and systematised so they can be transmitted orally
generation to generation using memorisation techniques such as chanting. The
Pali canon was not written down until hundreds of years after the Buddha has
passed away.

As such, there is no "official" Pali alphabet or writing. Pali can be transcribed
fairly faithfully in a number of alphabets, including Roman letters (with the
addition of a few diacritical marks or accented characters similar to other
European languages).

For this textbook, I will use Roman letters as the basis for the Pali alphabet
since I am used to that.

Of course, no one knows for sure how Pali words would have been pronounced,
and how Pali sentences would have been spoken, particularly with regards to
tonality. Modern day Pali pronunciation is based on how the Buddhist Pali canon
is chanted in various countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.

## Pali sentence structure

A Pali sentence (`vākya`) or Pali text (`pali`) is generally composed of
multiple words (`pada` or `vacana`). Since Pali was an oral language,
punctuation mark and upper/lower case conventions are typically not used,
although modern editors have sometimes added these to aid reading.

Words also do not need to be separated by spaces, although modern Pali editions
of text do add spaces, to aid reading. Later on, we will find out Pali
has compound words, which consist of multiple words joined together to create a
composite word.

To be able to distinguish words in a sentence, Pali relies
heavily on `paccaya` (affixes to roots or word stems) to create distinctive
word endings. Fluent Pali listeners will no doubt listen to the sound of these
endings to distinguish the words. These endings also give additional meaning
to the words and indicate how the words are used in a sentence.

Because of this, the word order in a Pali sentence is less important than many
other languages, however there are conventions for how to arrange words in a
typical sentence. Speakers can unconventionally reorder words, typically to
give emphasis to certain words or to augment or add nuance to a sentence's
emotional meaning.

This is similar to our reaction when we hear "Yoda" speak in the "Star Wars"
series of films. We appreciate who Yoda is as a personality, and we pay more
attention to his words simply because of the different order.

## `dhātu` (roots)

Fundamentally, all words in Pali are said to be derived from one or more `dhātu`
(roots). These roots are similar to Sanskrit roots. Pali can be regarded as
a simplified version of Sanskrit, however some of the roots may have different
meanings, or nuances. There are some that say Sanskrit was a "sacred" language
reserved for priests and members of the holy caste, whereas Pali, along with
many other Indian languages, was spoken by the common people. The Buddha may
have spoken in Pali because he wanted to convey his teachings to ordinary
people, not just privileged members of a particular caste.

`dhātu` can have 1-3 syllables:

| type | example | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| single stem or one-syllable roots | `vā` | to move |
|| `yā` | to go |
|| `pā` | to drink
|| `ji` | to conquer |
|| `nī` | to carry |
|| `su` |to flow |
|| `bhū` | to be |
| dual-word roots | `gamu` | to go |
|| `paca` | to cook |
|| `vada` |to speak |
| multiple-stem or three syllable roots | `vāyama` | to attempt |
|| `araha` | to deserve|
|| `kilisa` | to torment |

A series
of transformations convert a root into a word by adding `paccaya` (affixes).
Words can also be formed by combining a root with one or more `upasagga`
(prefixes). Multiple `upasagga` and different forms of `paccaya` can be applied
to a root before it becomes a word, thus creating multi-syllabic
words. The result is a word that can be used in a sentence.

Altogether there are around 1700 roots in Pali. However, many many words can
be made from them by attaching `upasagga` (prefixes) and various affixes
(`paccaya`). In theory, fresh words can be formed by new combinations of roots
with different prefixes so the adventurous Pali student can attempt to create
Pali words for "modern" terms such as "computer" or "phone".

It is not really necessary to memorise the 1700 roots, although it will be
very useful if the reader chooses to do so. Knowing all the roots and the
various prefixes and affixes will allow the reader to sometimes (not always)
"guess" the meaning of a word not previously encountered, and will also help
when applying the various transformation rules (see below).

## `sandhi` (word transformations)

As Pali is a spoken language, when words are combined to form a sentence,
changes may occur between words (or sometimes even within a word) to make
the sentence "flow" or "sound" better.

In English, we often shorten words like "can not" to "can't", or "I will" to
"I'll". This happens very frequently in Pali, especially when two vowels become
adjacent to each other from two words next to each other, and there are complex
rules governing how such transformations occur.

As a example {10} (don't worry about the meaning of the words for now):

> `tatra` + `ayaṁ` + `ādi`  
> = tatr~~a~~ + ~~a~~ā ya~~ṁ~~m + ādi  
> = `tatrā’ya’mādi`  
> = `tatrāyamādi`

As you can see, when there are two adjacent vowels when we join two or more
words together, `sandhi` typically involves deleting one of the vowels, and
then either retaining, lengthening or changing the remaining vowel. Sometimes
the consonant next to the vowel may also be changed.

The overall effect is to make the words easier to say as a group. Although
`tatrāyamādi` may seem like a single word because of `sandhi`, a listener
should still regard them as separate words when trying to understand a
sentence. However, some `sandhi` combinations of common words are so often
encountered they have acquired distinctive meaning as combined words.

Another example {11}

> `tatra` + `abhiratiṁ` + `iccheyya`  
> = tatr~~a~~ + ~~a~~ā bhirati~~ṁ~~m + iccheyya  
> = `tatrā’bhirati’miccheyya`  
> = `tatrābhiratimiccheyya`  
> "... should prefer enjoying at that ..."

For the time being, we are not going to go into detail on these rules but
be aware that words may change in a sentence. Eventually, as you read more
and more sentences in Pali, these changes will become easier to recognise.

## `nāmā` (nouns) {52}

`nāmā` are the most common type of words in Pali, and roughly (but not exactly)
correspond to the term "noun" in English. `nāmā` also means "name", so these
words represent things that we can "name" - including people, places, things,
numbers, feelings and many other objects or concepts.

### Example {53}

Here is a simple sentence, consisting of 3 `nāma`:

> **eso no satthā**

which translates as:

> that person/being / our / teacher  
> *That person [is] our teacher.*

Instead of `satthā` other examples may be:

* `brahmā` (God)
* `attā` (self)
* `sakhā` (friend)
* `rājā` (King)

### `liṅga` (gender) {53}

`nāma` can be classified into 3 different types or `liṅga`. The word `liṅga`
actually means "gender", and traditionally each `nāma` is assigned a gender. The
`liṅga` represents an "intrinsic property" of the `nāma`.

The notion of a Pali gender is similar to (but not quite the same as) genders
in some European languages. However, there are differences that it's best to
regard `liṅga` as a classification scheme or grammatical construct rather than
what we may think of as "gender". I like to think of it this way:

* `pulliṅga` - the "major" or "default" type. Most nouns fall into this category.
  Generally associated with masculinity or masculine persons (but not always)
* `napuṁsakaliṅga` - the "special" type. Tend to be used for nouns that don't
  quite fit with the notions of masculinity or feminity, or represent abstract
  concepts.
* `itthiliṅga` - the "minor" type, comparatively rare with respect to the
  other two types. Generally associated with feminity or feminine persons.

Note that for the remainder of this book, we may refer to the above `liṅga`
by the following symbols for brevity:

* 🚹 = `pulliṅga`
* 🚻 = `napuṁsakaliṅga`
* 🚺 = `itthiliṅga`

Ancient India was a patriarchal society, and men were regarded as the "major"
component of society, doing activities considered important, hence the
tendency is to associate important words to `pulliṅga`.

### Number

Like in English, Pali words are slightly different depending on whether they are
used to refer to one thing vs many things.

* ⨀ = `ekavacana` (singular)
* ⨂ = `bahuvacana` (plural)

There used to be also a "dual" form but that is now largely obsolete and
encountered in very rare instances. Examples include:

* `to idh’āgato` (these two having come)
* `ubho` (both)
* `mātāpitu` (father and mother)

### `vibhatti` (case endings) {54}

Unlike English, words need to be "transformed" before they are used in a
sentence. This is done by adding endings or "suffixes" to the word (`vibhatti`).

Altogether there are seven types of `vibhatti`, and they are
conveniently numbered 1 to 7 {55}:

| symbol | ⨀ | ⨂ | vibhatti |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| ① | `si` | `yo` | `paṭhamā` ("first") |
| ② | `aṁ` | `yo` | `dutiyā` ("second") |
| ③ | `nā` | `hi` | `tatiyā` ("third") |
| ④ | `sa` | `naṁ` | `catutthī` ("fourth") |
| ⑤ | `smā` | `hi` | `pañcamī` ("fifth") |
| ⑥ | `sa` | `naṁ` | `chaṭṭhī` ("sixth") |
| ⑦ | `smiṁ` | `su` | `sattamī` ("seventh") |

You may note the 4th and 6th case endings are the same, which means in practice
we can only tell which case is being used by context (more later). Notice also
the plural endings for some of the cases are the same. Again, which case is
being used can only be determined by context.

Let's start with an example. Suppose we have the word `purisa` ("man", in the masculine gender or 🚹) and we
want to use it in a sentence in singular form, and we wish to transform it using
the 1st case ending (`paṭhamāvibhatti`). If we look up the above table, we
should add the `si` ending (using rule of {55}):

> `purisa` + `si` → `puriso`

Wait, what happened? Why does the transformation not result in `purisasi`?

This is where additional rules comes into play. By rule of {83}, any
word ending in `a` will be transformed into the 1st case by deleting
the `a` and by rule of {104} replacing the `si` with `o`. Kaccāyana has a whole
chapter of such rules.

So the transformation becomes:

`purisa` + `si`  
→ `puris`~~`a`~~ + `si` {83}  
→ `puris` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `puriso`

The plural form undergoes a similar transformation:

`purisa` + `yo`  
→ `puris`~~`a`~~ + `si` {83}  
→ `puris` + ~~`yo`~~(`ā`) {107}  
→ `purisā`

This does make things interesting, because the transformation result for every
word then depends on:

* `kāra’nta` (word ending)
* `liṅga` (gender)
* `ekavacana` (singular) vs. `bahuvacana` (plural)
* `vibhatti` (desired case ending)

Here is a table of `purisa` transformed in all the 7 cases and
singular vs plural.

| number | vibhatti | ending | transformation | sutta | result |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- | --- | --- |
| ⨀ | ① | `si` | puris~~a~~ + ~~si~~o | {104} | `puriso` |
| ⨂ | ① | `yo` | puris~~a~~ + ~~yo~~ā | {107} | `purisā` |
| ⨀ | ② | `aṁ` | puris~~a~~ + aṁ | | `purisaṁ` |
| ⨂ | ② | `yo` | puris~~a~~ + ~~yo~~e | {107} | `purise` |
| ⨀ | ③ | `nā` | puris~~a~~ + ena | {103} | `purisena` |
| ⨂ | ③ | `hi` | puris~~a~~e + hi | {101} | `purisehi` |
| ⨂ | ③ | `hi` | puris~~a~~e + bhi | {99}-{101} | `purisebhi` |
| ⨀ | ④ | `sa` | purisa + ssa | {61} | `purisassa` |
| ⨂ | ④ | `naṁ` | puris~~a~~ā + naṁ | {89} | `purisānaṁ` |
| ⨀ | ⑤ | `smā` | purisa + smā | | `purisasmā` |
| ⨀ | ⑤ | `smā` | purisa + mhā | {99} | `purisamhā` |
| ⨀ | ⑤ | `smā` | puris~~a~~ā | {108} | `purisā` |
| ⨂ | ⑤ | `hi` | puris~~a~~e + hi | {101} | `purisehi` |
| ⨂ | ⑤ | `hi` | puris~~a~~e + bhi | {99}-{101} | `purisebhi` |
| ⨀ | ⑥ | `sa` | puris~~a~~ + ssa | {61} | `purisassa` |
| ⨂ | ⑥ | `naṁ` | puris~~a~~ā + naṁ | {89} | `purisānaṁ` |
| ⨀ | ⑦ | `smiṁ` | purisa + smiṁ | | `purisasmiṁ` |
| ⨀ | ⑦ | `smiṁ` | purisa + mhi | {99} | `purisamhi` |
| ⨀ | ⑦ | `smiṁ` | puris~~a~~e | {108} | `purise` |
| ⨂ | ⑦ | `su` | puris~~a~~e + su | {101} | `purisesu` |

You will note that in some of the cases, there are multiple ways the word can
be transformed. For example, singular `purisa` can be transformed in the 3rd
case into either `purisehi` or `purisebhi`. Both are acceptable. Which should we
use for a given sentence? It depends on the "sound" - a native speaker would
have chosen the version that sounded the most pleasing, depending on surrounding
words.

The rules can be quite complicated, so let's not worry about them for now.
In practice, you can rely on looking up a relevant table to determine the
appropriate transformation (TBD). If you are just reading Pali, then with
practice you will learn to recognise the various endings which will become
familiar to you.

{{< alert title="Reference" color="light">}}
A summary of the rules is provided in 
[**G: `vibhatti` Rules**]({{< relref "vibhatti" >}})
{{< /alert >}}

A much more important question to answer at this point is ...

### Why do we need `vibhatti` endings and what is their purpose?

In English, when we see a sentence like

> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

We know that words "quick" and "brown" refers to the "fox", which is the
"subject" of the sentence, and "lazy" refers to the dog, which is the "object"
of the sentence. The verb "jumped over" separates the subject and the object.
Our brain automatically "collects" and "groups" the words, so we read the
sentence as:

> (The quick brown fox) jumped over (the lazy dog).

In English, as we can see, word order is important. If we mixed the words up,
the sentence becomes far harder to read:

> Over the quick lazy brown fox the dog jumped.

This sentence would imply quite a different meaning.

In Pali, all words with the same gender and the same case ending should be
grouped together, and that's how we distinguish which words belong to which
entity. So the word order becomes far less important, we could mix the words
up and the sentence would still have the same meaning!

In practice, the 1st case is usually reserved for the "most important" entity
in a sentence, the 2nd for the "second most important" and so on.

So, in the above English sentence, were it to be translated the Pali, "the
quick brown fox" would all be in the 1st case, and "the lazy dog" would all be
in the 2nd case. If there are more entities, they would take the 3rd, 4th
cases and so on.

In many sentences, the 1st case would usually refer to the entity or actor
"performing" or "doing" the action (or, the "subject" of the sentence), and
the 2nd case refers to the entity being impacted by the action  (the "object")
of the sentence. Although this is a very common pattern, it is by no means
rigid, and in theory any case ending can be used for any purpose. There are
many examples in the Pali canon where the cases are used in unconventional
ways. (TBD: need to include examples)

### Vibhatti usage typical meanings {271}-{315}

The following meanings are usually associated with each
case. However, as noted above, these are conventions only, and the author of a
sentence may choose to adopt an unconventional approach of assigning words to
cases (perhaps for emphatic or stylistic reasons).

| vibhatti | number | role | usage | Pali term | sutta |
| :-: | :-: | --- | --- | --- | :-: |
| ① | ⨀/⨂ | subject (active) | subject, doer | `kattu`/`kattā` | {284} |
| ① | ⨀/⨂ | address | to address, to call | `ālapana` | {285} |
| ② | ⨀ | to (object) | object | `kamma` | {297} |
| ② | ⨂ | till | continuity for a certain period or distance | `accantasaṁyoga` | {298} |
| ③ | ⨀ | by (subject) (passive) | subject | `kattu`/`kattā` | {288} |
| ③ | ⨂ | by/with | supporting cause | `karaṇa` | {286} |
| ③ | ⨂ | with/together | company | `sahayoga` | {287} |
| ③ | ⨂ | by means of/in regard of | aspect or adjective | `visesana` | {292} |
| ③ | ⨂ | due to/for | reason | `kāraṇa` | {289} |
| ④ | ⨀/⨂ | receivership/purpose | recipient of action | `sampadāna` | {293} |
| ⑤ | ⨀ | from | source from which it occurs | `apādāna` | {295} |
| ⑤ | ⨂ | for/due to | reason | `kāraṇa` | {296} |
| ⑥ | ⨀ | (possessive) of | owner | `sāmi` | {301} |
| ⑥ | ⨂ | among/out of | selection for comparison | `niddhāraṇa` | {304} |
| ⑥ | ⨂ | while/despite | two concurrent actions | `anādara` | {305} |
| ⑦ | ⨀ | at, in, on | location/position | `adhikaraṇa`/`okāsa` | {302} |
| ⑦ | ⨂ | among/out of | selection for comparison | `niddhāraṇa` | {304} |
| ⑦ | ⨂ | for/due to | cause | `nimitta` | {310} |
| ⑦ | ⨂ | while/when | two concurrent actions | `lakkhaṇa` | {313} |
| ⑦ | ⨂ | despite/while | two concurrent actions | `anādara` | {305} |

{{< alert title="Reference" color="light">}}
For a detailed explanation of the various meanings associated with each case
ending, please refer to the next chapter:

[**2: `kāraka` (word ending) meanings**]({{< relref "cases" >}})
{271}-{315}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="secondary">}}
You may find in Pali grammar books written in English the following nomenclature
for the cases:

* ① = "nominative"
* ② = "accusative"
* ③ = "instrumental"
* ④ = "dative"
* ⑤ = "ablative"
* ⑥ = "genitive"
* ⑦ = "locative"

Note that these terms only partially reflect the possible meanings and roles
associated with each case, so I would discourage using these terms. They can
lead to confusion. However, these terms are common in Pali-English dictionaries
so I encourage you to substitute the case number when you see these terms.
{{< /alert >}}

### ⓪ `ālapana` (vocative) {57}

English Pali textbooks often refer to a "vocative" case, but this is not
recognised as a separate case but a variant of the 1st case. The usual case
ending `si` (for 1st case singular) is instead called `ga` but the
transformation rules are similar to `si`.

Examples:

> `bhoti ayye`! (Oh madam!)  
> `bhoti kaññe`! (Oh girl!)  
> `bhoti kharādiye`!  (Oh the girl named Kharādiya!)

Contrast this to the normal 1st case form of `ayyā` (🚺⨀①):

> `sā ayyā` (that lady)

In plural:

> `bhotiyo ayyāyo` (Oh Madams!)

### *️⃣ `sabbanāma` (pronouns)

`sabba` means "all" so `sabbanāma` are "common" or "generic" nouns that can
apply in "all' situations.

Examples of `sabbanāma` include the different `vibhatti` forms of `ya`
("who, what"), `ta` ("he/she/it", "that"), `eta` ("this"), `ima` ("this"),
`amu` ("that"), `kiṁ` ("what?"). One of the common usage of `sabbanāma` is as
"pronouns", where they can assume all genders to represent
all things and persons of the different genders. But they can also function
as adjectives, adverbs, honorifics and interrogatives.

Examples:

| Sabbanāma | meaning | ④ | ⑥ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `sabba` | all | `sabbesaṁ` | `sabbesānaṁ` |
| `ya` | which | `yesaṁ` | `yesānaṁ` |
| `ta` | that | `tesaṁ` | `tesānaṁ` |
| `ima` | this | `imesaṁ` | `imesānaṁ` |
| `ka` | who | `kesaṁ` | `kesānaṁ` |
| `itara` | other | `itaresaṁ` (others) | `itaresānaṁ` (others) |
| `katama` | what | `katamesaṁ` (of which ones) | `katamesānaṁ` (of which ones) |

## ⏏️ `nipāta` (particles)

`nipāta` means "to fall. i.e. to be placed anywhere", and refer to words
that can be found placed in the beginning, in the middle or at the end of
sentences and words, but not usually regarded as prefixes (see below).

Generally, the `vibhatti` endings of `nipāta` words are elided as these words
are not related to other words in the sentence and therefore do not need to
be matched with them. {221}

However, in some instances, the `vibhatti` endings may be retained, if the
`nipāta` word play a role in the sentence meaning.

### Examples

> tvaṁ **panā’vuso**! tumhe **panā’vuso**!

you / (no specific meaning) / friend  
you (plural) / (no specific meaning) / friend  
*How about you, my friend? And the rest of you (plural)?*

> **padaso** dhammaṁ vāceyya

by word / dhamma / teach (causative, optative)  
*(He) should teach and say Dhamma word by word.*

> vihāraṁ • **sve** upagaccheyya

to temple / tomorrow / should approach (optative)  
*(He) should come to the temple tomorrow.*

The following is a brief descriptive list of some nipāta words. Some are plain
nipātas without any affix, while some are with indeclinable affixes. Some may
even have a sort of vibhatti-ending in them or may still have traces of
vibhattis. Please note that the implied meaning of elided vibhatti still remains
in effect for some nipāta words such as `yathā`, `tathā` and `evaṁ` etc.

| `nipāta` | meaning | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yathā`, `tathā` | in a manner that, in such a way as | combination of `sabbanāma` `ya` `ta` with indeclinable affix `thā`. The affix itself is ex- pressive of manner or mood. |
| `evaṁ` | thus, in this way, true as it is said, yes (many meanings) | dutiyāvibhatti, very frequently used in Pāli texts |
| khalu | used mostly in a reported narrative | |
| `kho` | mostly meaningless, but sometimes it may mean “only, really” | a plain nipāta, found often in main Buddhist texts. Used together with `atha` `evaṁ` `taṁ` etc. |
| `tatra` | there | a combination of `sabbanāma` `ta` with indeclinable affix `tra` |
| `atho` | in addition, besides | |
| `atha` | now, then, later on, if | Sometimes used in the beginning of a chapter or an episode, as an introductory or initiating word |
| `hi` | really, for, only | Sometimes a meaningless particle |
| `tu` | in addition, only | Also an expletive without meaning, sometimes added to be more emphatic in a statement |
| `ca` | also, too | It is used to express some additional meaning in grammatical texts. Sometimes meaningless. Sometimes it has a lot of meanings when used after other nipāta particles |
| `vā` | similar to either or, in other ways | In grammatical texts, sometimes it is used to express other option or method or inconsistency of a function. Sometimes with no particular meaning |
| `vo` | you | It is sometimes a meaningless expletive |
| `haṁ`, `ahaṁ` | I | the use of these two nipāta are seldom found in texts unless it means “I” |
| `alaṁ` | (a) enough, (b) suitable, (c) worthiness, (d) appropriateness, (e) ability | Also, (f) sometimes used as a prohibition or rejection, usually used in combination with (1) a noun in instrumental case, or (2) tuṁ-infinitive Kita verbs or (3) an āya-infinitive in dative case nouns |
| `eva` | equal to “only” | used next to the word it want to modify or restrict or confirm in its implied meaning. A plain nipāta. |
| `ho!`, `aho!` | | these are expression of interjection or surprise. No vibhatti |
| `he!`, `ahe!`, `re!`, `are!` | “hey” | Vocative nipāta particles, similar to “hey” in English. Usually vocative case vibhatti is applicable, but to be elided |

### `nipāta` as prefixes

However, there are quite a few `nipāta` that can be placed before some verbs or
`kita`-affixed nouns and used in a way resembling prefixes.

| combined | `nipāta` | word | combined meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `antaradhāyati` | `antara` | `dhāyati` | (he) disappears |
| `āvikaroti` | `āvi` | `karoti` | (he) makes it openly, displays clearly |
| `pātubhavati` | `pātu` | `bhavati` | (it) arises visibly, i.e. appears |

## 🔼 `upasagga` (prefixes)

There are 20 `upasagga` words which are usually applied as prefixes to
`ākhyāta` (verbs) and `kita`-affixed nouns (see below). Like `nipāta`,
`upasagga` words also have their `vibhatti` endings elided, but in some cases
where they are functioning as independent words (not attached to a verb or
noun), they may retain their `vibhatti` endings.

There are three kinds of `upasagga`:

1. `dhātva’tthā’nuvattaka` - those that follow the meaning of the root, without affecting its original meaning.
2. `dhātva’tthabādhaka` - those that absolutely mean opposite of the root. These categorically change the original meaning of the root.
3. `dhātva’tthavisesaka` - those that enhance the original meaning of the root by adding more specific meaning and flavour to it.

Example:

> parābhavo

🔼(parā) 🚹⨀①(bhava)  
opposite / to be, being
*loss, ruin*

Here are various words that can be formed from the word `hara` ("carrying")
together with various `upasagga` prefixes and the `ṇa`-suffix:

| example | `upasagga` | meaning | combined meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pahāro` | `pa` | specially | carrying (instruments of harm) specially, i.e. beating, striking |
| `nihāro` | `ni` | out | taking out, evicting |
| `nīhāro` | `nī` | out | taking out, evicting (same as above) |
| `uhāro` | `u` | up | carrying up |
| `duhāro` | `du` | bad | carrying badly |
| `saṁhāro` | `saṁ` | well | carrying well |
| `vihāro` | `vi` | specially | carrying one’s body specially, staying, i.e. act of staying at a place using alternating bodily modes |
| `avahāro` | `ava` | lowly,contemptuous, mean | carrying in a mean manner, i.e. stealing |
| `anuhāro` | `anu` | following, subsequent | carrying accordingly |

## 🆎 `samāsa` (compound nouns) {316}-{343}

Like German, Pali often combines many nouns to form a compound noun.

The following table summarises the major types of compound nouns, typical
`liṅga` (gender) and examples:

| type | name | `liṅga` | example | rule |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- | :-: |
| `abyayībhāva` | Adverbial | 🚻 | `so napuṁsakaliṅgo` | {320} |
| `kammadhāraya` | Appositional | variable, or follow last component | `abhidheyavacano, paraliṅgo ca` | {341} |
| `digu` | Numeral Appositional | 🚻 (usually ⨀ but can be ⨂) | `digusseʼkattaṁ` | {321} |
| `tappurisa` | Determinative | variable | `ayañʼca tappuriso abhidheyavacanaliṅgo` | Rūpasiddhi {351} |
| `dvanda` | Copulative | Mostly 🚻 but variable in some instances per last component | `samāhāre napuṁsakaṁ` | Moggalāna {20} Chapter 3 |
| `bahubbīhi` | Attributive | variable per the contextual meaning of the aññapada (the external word of attributive meaning) | `bahubbīhi cāʼyaṁ abhidheyaliṅgavacano` | Rūpasiddhi {352} |

The rules for constructing a `samāsa` can be complex:

`rāja` + `putta` (the King's son)  
→ `rāja` + `sa` + `putta` (⨀⑥)  
→ `rāja` + `sa` + `putta` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `rā`~~`ja`~~(`ññ`) + ~~`sa`~~(`o`) + `putta` + `si` {135}  
→ `rāñño` + `putt`~~`a`~~ + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {83}  
→ `rāñño` + `putto`  
→ `rā`~~`ñño`~~(`ja`) + `putt`~~`o`~~(`a`) {317}  
→ `rājaputta` {318}  
→ `rājaputta` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `rājaputta` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `rājaputt`~~`a`~~ + `o` {83}  
→ `rājaputto`

Fortunately, resources such as the
[Digital Pali Dictionary](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) can
deconstruct compound words into their individual words, which helps the
beginner to understand such words encountered. So there is less of a need to
learn the complex rules associated with them.

## ➡️ `taddhita` (affixes) {344}-{405}

Various affixes can be added to a noun to create derived nouns and adjectives.

Compare and contrast with English use of affixes such as "-al", "-ly", "-er",
"-or" etc. For example, "topic" vs "topical", "true" vs "truly".

In English, "navigate" is a verb, whereas "navigator" (with an "-or" affix) is
a profession. Similarly, in Pali, `nāvā` is "boat", `nāvā` with `ṇika` as an
affix becomes `nāviko` ("traveller by boat", or "sailor"). Note that the last
vowel of the root and the `ṇ` are both elided, and then the noun is given the
🚹⨀① vibhatti ending.

The rules for constructing a `tadhitta` affixed noun can be rather daunting:

`vasiṭṭha` + `apacca` (Vasiṭṭha’s son)  
→ `vasiṭṭha` + `sa` (⨀⑥) + `apacca`  
→ `vasiṭṭha` + `s` + `sa` + `apacca` {61}  
→ `vasiṭṭhassa` + `apacca` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `vasiṭṭhassa` + `apacca` + ~~`si`~~(`aṁ`) {219}  
→ `vasiṭṭhassa` + `apacc`~~`a`~~ + `aṁ` {83}  
→ `vasiṭṭhassa` + `apaccaṁ` (of Vasiṭṭha / son)  
→ `vasiṭṭhassa` + `ṇa` + `apaccaṁ` {344}  
→ `vasiṭṭha`~~`ssa`~~ + `ṇa` + ~~`apaccaṁ`~~ {317}  
→ `vasiṭṭha` + ~~`ṇ`~~`a` {396}  
→ `vasiṭṭha` + `a` {318}  
→ `v`~~`a`~~(`ā`)`siṭṭha` + `a` {400}  
→ `vāsiṭṭha` + ~~`a`~~ {83}  
→ `vāsiṭṭha` {601}  
→ `vāsiṭṭha` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `vāsiṭṭha` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `vāsiṭṭh`~~`a`~~ + `o` {83}  
→ `vāsiṭṭho`

| type | meaning | affix | rule | `liṅga` |

| `tappakati` | made up of something | `maya` | {372} | variable |

*`ka` is added sometimes. eg. `dayāluko`

Words with `taddhita` affixes are sometimes not recognised by Pali-English
dictionaries, since these dictionaries may not cover the full range of possible
affixes and their meanings. So it is probably
worthwhile learning how to recognise `taddhita` affixed words and the associated
meanings.

### Numbers

Pali numbers have their own set of `tadhikka` affixes (to denote "first",
"second", "third" etc.)

| type | name | affix | rule | `liṅga` | notes |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `Saṅkhyā Taddhita` | Numbers | `ma` | {373} | variable | |
| | | `ī` | {375} | 🚺 | |
| | | `ti` | {378},{389} | 🚺 | derivative morpheme |
| | | `tiya` | {385} | variable | |
| | | `ka` | {392} | 🚻 | |

| no | Cardinals | Ordinals |
| --: | --: | --: |
 1 | `eka` | `paṭhama` |
 2 | `dvi`, `di`, `du`, `dve` | `dutiya` |
 3 | `ti` or `tri` | `tatiya` |
 4 | `catu` or `catur` (before a vowel) | `catuttha`, `turīya` |
 5 | `pañca` | `pañcatha`, `pañcama` |
 6 | `cha` | `chaṭṭha`, `chatthama` |
 7 | `satta` | `sattha`, `sattama`|
 8 | `aṭṭha` | `aṭṭhama` |
 9 | `nava` | `navama` |
 10 | `dasa`, `rasa`, `lasa`, `ḷasa` | `dasama`, `dasī` |

### `Abyaya` (indeclinable affixes)

These are undeclinable (and no `liṅga`), and often used as adverbs or
adjectives.

| affix | rule |
| :-: | :-: |
| `dhā` | {397} |
| `so` | by `ca` of {397} |
| `thā` | {398} |
| `thattā` | by `tu` of {398} |
| `thaṁ` | {398} |
| `khattuṁ` | `Uṇādisutta` {646} |

### Abyaya affixes applied after Sabbanāma-nouns

These are often used as a substitute or replacement for case endings
(particularly ⑤ and ⑦), since they are indeclinable. They also have no
`liṅga` (gender).

| use | affix | rule |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| To express reason or time | `to` | {248} |
| To express position or place | `to` | {248} |
| | `tra`, `tha` | {249} |
| | `dhi` | {250} |
| | `va` | {251} |
| | `hiṁ`, `haṁ`, `haṁ` | {252} |
| | `ha`, `dha` | {254} |
| To express time | `dā`, `dācanaṁ` | {254} |
| | `hiṁ`, `haṁ`, `haṁ` | {252} |
| To express day | `jja`, `jju` | {571} |

## `ākhyāta` (verbs) {406}-{523}

Like nouns, verbs also have `vibhatti` endings affixed to them when used in
sentences, but the endings are different from those of nouns. These endings
depend on:

* voice {406}-{407}
  * 🟢 = `parassapada` (active)
  * 🔵 = `attanopada` (middle) - impersonal
* number
  * ⨀ = `ekavacana` (singular)
  * ⨂ = `bahuvacana` (plural)
* person {408}-{412} (if more than one, the last applies)
  * 🤟 = `paṭhama purisa` (first person, equivalent to 'third person' in English)
  * 🤘 = `majjima purisa` (middle person, equivalent to 'second person' in English)
  * 👆 = `uttama purisa` (primary person, equivalent to 'first person' in English)
* tense/mood {413}-{422}
  * ▶️ = `vattamāna` (present)*
  * ⏹ = `piñcamī` (imperative) - (used to express) āṇatti (command), āsīsa (wish) at a non-specific time-frame mode (anuttakāla)*
  * ⏯ = `sattamī` (potential/optative)*
  * 🔄 = `parokkhā` (past perfect)
  * ↩️ = `hiyyattanī` (past imperfect)*
  * ⏮ = `ajjatanī`(aorist)
  * ⏭ = `bhavissanti` (future)
  * 🔀 = `kālātipatti` (conditional)

\* collectively referred to as `sabbadhātuka vibhatti`

{{< alert title="Note" color="secondary">}}
Note that the above tense/mood categories have been labelled with the nearest
linguistic term (eg. "present", "past perfect", "aorist" etc.) these
categories do not align precisely to those terms. I discourage the use of
these terms and rely on the Pali terms instead and the usage of each category
will be described later in this chapter.

### verb terminations {423}-{430}

| | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🔵 | 🔵 | 🔵 | 🔵 | 🔵 | 🔵 |

Here is an example of the root `gamu` (to go) with all the verb endings applied.
A number of transformations need to happen prior to affixing the `vibhatti`:

`gamu`  
→ `gam`~~`u`~~ (elision of final vowel per rule {521})  
→ `gam`~~`m`~~(`cch`) (m→cch per rule {476})  
→ `gacch`

Here is an example for transforming into the `parassapada` (🟢), `ekavacana`
(⨀), `paṭhama purisa` (🤟), `vattamāna` (▶️) form:

`gamu` + `ti` {414}  
→ `gam`~~`u`~~ + `ti` {521}  
→ `gam` + `a` + `ti` {445}  
→ `ga`~~`m`~~(`cch`) + `a` + `ti` {476}  
→ `gacchati`

The plural form `bahuvacana` (⨂) undergoes a similar transformation:

`gamu` + `anti` {414}  
→ `gam`~~`u`~~ + `anti` {521}  
→ `gam` + a + `anti` {445}  
→ `ga`~~`m`~~(`cch`) + `a` + `anti` {476}  
→ `gacch` + `a` + ~~`a`~~`nti` {510}  
→ `gacchanti`

Note that some of the terminations are the same so in practice we will need
to distinguish which tense is being used from context. Note also the irregular
forms, particularly the aorist ones. The irregular aorists tend to be more
commonly used than the regular forms. This is so prevalent other grammar books
such as **Moggalāṇa Vyākaraṇa** and **Rūpasiddhi** created rules to accomodate
them.

### Voices

Like Sanskrit, Pali supports 3 different ways of expressing sentences, based on
the "voice":

1. the active voice (`kattu`) {444}-{452}
2. the passive voice (`kamma`)
3. the impersonal voice (`bhāva`)

However, in Pali literature, `bhāva` (middle, or impersonal, voice) is seldom
used, probably because most of the literature is based on the Buddha (or a
disciple) "speaking" to a group of monks, which has then been transformed into
a structure suitable for memorisation and chanting.

### 🔴 Passive verb endings `Vattamānā Vibhatti` {440}-{443}

A passive verb is created by using the `attanopada` (🔵) endings together
with an infix of `ya` in between the root and the ending.

Note that passive verbs can only be formed based on roots that can be expressed
in a "passive" (`kamma`) sense - some roots can only result into "active" verbs
and cannot be transformed this way.

Example transformation (based on the root `paca` (to cook)):

`paca` + `ya` + `te` {440}  
→ `pa`~~`ca`~~  + ~~`y`~~(`cc`)`a` + `te` {441}  
→ `paccate` ("is cooked")

The full set of `attanopada` (🔵) endings of in the present tense `vattamāna`
(▶️) across the 3 persons and plurality:

| voice | number | person | tense | ending | transformation | result |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- | --- |
| 🔴 | 🤟 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `te` | pa~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)a + te | `paccate` |
| 🔴 | 🤟 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `ante` | pa~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)a + ante | `paccante` |
| 🔴 | 🤘 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `se` | pa~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)a + se | `paccase` |
| 🔴 | 🤘 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `vhe` | pa~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)a + vhe | `paccavhe` |
| 🔴 | 👆 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `e` | pac~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)~~a~~ + e | `pacce` |
| 🔴 | 👆 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `mhe` | pacc~~ca~~  + ~~y~~(cc)~~a~~ + ā + mhe | `paccāmhe` |

Because the middle voice is seldom used, rule {518} allows these verbs to be
retransformed into "reversed" `parassapada` (🟢) endings:

| voice | number | person | tense | ending | transformation | result |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- | --- |
| 🔴 | 🤟 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `ti` | pacca~~te~~ + ti | `paccati` |
| 🔴 | 🤟 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `anti` | pacc~~ante~~ + anti | `paccanti` |
| 🔴 | 🤘 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `si` | pacca~~se~~ + si | `paccasi` |
| 🔴 | 🤘 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `tha` | pacca~~vhe~~ + tha | `paccatha` |
| 🔴 | 👆 | ⨀ | ▶️ | `mi` | pacc~~e~~ + ā + mi | `paccāmi` |
| 🔴 | 👆 | ⨂ | ▶️ | `ma` | pacc~~āmhe~~ + ā + ma | `paccāma` |

Typically we would use the `parassapada` (🟢) endings for passive verbs.

Other examples (using different rules):

`kara` ("to do")  
→ `kara` + `ya` + `te` {440}  
→ `kara` + `ī` + `ya` + `te` {442}  
→ `kar`~~`a`~~ + `ī` + `ya` + `te` {521}  
→ `karīyate` ("is done")

`vaḍha` ("to grow")  
→ `vaḍha` + `ya` + `te` {440}  
→ `va`~~`ḍha`~~ + ~~`ya`~~(`ḍḍha`) + `te` {443}  
→ `vuḍḍhate` ("is grown")

### 🟠 Causative verbs

There are two types of causative verbs:

1. Causative verb in the active voice
2. Causative verb in the passive voice

There 4 typical causative affixes (`kārita`) used to construct causative verbs
{438}:

* `ṇe`
* `ṇaya`
* `ṇāpe`
* `ṇāpaya`

Just like for `tadhikka` noun affixes, the `ṇ` is typically elided when joined
to a root, leaving the remaining letters. {523}

Various vowel gradation transformations may also take place when joining the
affix to the noun as per rule {483}.

Example transformation (based on the root `paca` (to cook)) and the causative
affix `ṇe`:

`paca` + `ṇe` + `ti` {438}  
`pac`~~`a`~~ + `ṇe` + `ti` {521}  
→ `pac` + ~~`ṇ`~~`e` + `ti` {523}  
→ `p`~~`a`~~(`ā`)`c` + `e` + `ti` {483}  
→ `pāceti` ("(he) causes to cook")

Note: not all forms of the above are encountered in Pali literature - they
represent the full theoretical set of causative forms that can be generated.

### 🟠🔴 Causative passive verbs

It is also possible to construct causative verbs in the passive voice, just by
adding the passive `ya` affix after the causative
affix. The `ṇaya` and `ṇāpaya` causative affixes are rarely used in the passive
voice.

Example transformation (based on the root `paca` (to cook)) and the causative
affix `ṇe` and the passive affix `ya`:

`paca` + `ṇe` + `ya` + `ti` {438,440}  
`pac`~~`a`~~ + `ṇe` + `ya` + `ti` {521}  
→ `pac` + ~~`ṇe`~~ + `ya` + `ti` {523}  
→ `p`~~`a`~~(`ā`)`c` + `ya` + `ti` {483}  
→ `pāciyati` ("is caused to be cooked")

#### 🔄 `parokkhā` {417}

{{< alert title="Note" color="secondary">}}
`paro’kkhā` = `para` + `akkha`  
beyond (ie. past) / physical senses
{{< /alert >}}

(to be applied to express things happened in one’s absence, in a situation where
the speaker is not a witness to) at a past time-frame mode (`atīta` - past).

in the dream / apparently / (he) said (`kila` + `āha`)  
*(He is supposed to have) said.*

> `evaṁ kila porāṇā’hu`

thus / apparently / ancient sages / said (`porāṇā` + `āhu`)  
*Ancient sages are supposed to have said thus.*

{{< alert title="Note" color="secondary">}}
`kila` is a `nipāta` (particle) used in indirect hearsay where the speaker is
uncertain of the truthfulness of what he heard or not a witness to the actual
event occurred. Sometimes it means an asseveration or an emphasis.

## Example sentence constructions

### `kattu-vācaka vākya` (active voice sentences)

An active voice sentence is a subject-principal sentence where Kattā (the agent,
doer subject) is much more dominant.

1. `kattu` (subject) - `Kathita Kattā` or `Vutta-kattā`` (predominant-subject) must be in 1st case (①)
2. `kamma` (object) - `Akathita-kamma` or `Avutta-kamma` (non-principal object)  must be in 2nd case (②)
3. The verb must be either in the `parassapada` termination (🟢) in most cases or in the `attanopada` termination (🔵) with or without an affix of `kattu` sense. [Affixes of `kamma` sense such as `ya`, or `kita` affixes eg. `tabba`, `ta`, etc. cannot be used]
4. The persons (subjects) and verbs should be concordant.

| Subject (①) | Object (②) | Verb | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `Puriso` | `odanaṁ` | `pacati` | Man cooks the rice |
| `Purisā` | `odanaṁ` | `pacanti` | Men cook the rice |
| `Buddhā` | `dhammaṁ` | `desenti` | Buddha teach the Dhamma |
| `Tvaṁ` | `odanaṁ` | `pacasi` | You cook the rice |
| `Tumhe` | `odanaṁ` | `pacatha` | You (plural) cook the rice |
| `Ahaṁ` | `odanaṁ` | `pacāmi` | I cook the rice |
| `Mayaṁ` | `odanaṁ` | `pacāma` | We cook the rice |

### `Kamma-vācaka Vākya` (passive voice sentences)

A passive voice sentence is a object-principal sentence where the Kamma (the
thing being done, the object) is more visibly dominant by being in the 1st case
(①).

The rules in a passive voice sentence are:

1. `kamma` (object) - `Kathita Kamma` or `Vutta-kamma` (predominant-object) must be in 1st case (①)
2. `kattā` (subject) - `Akathita-kattā` or an `Avutta-kattā` (non-principal subject)  must be in 3nd case (③)
3. The verb should be mainly in the `attanopada` termination (🔵) or it can be in a reversed `parassapada` form (🟢) with an affix which has a Kamma-sense only. {440}-{443}.
4. The object (not the subject!) and verb should be in agreement.

| Subject (③) | Object (①) | Verb | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `Purisena` | `odano` | `pacīyate` | The rice is cooked by man |
| `Purisehi` | `odano` | `pacīyate` | The rice is cooked by men |
| `Buddhena` | `dhammo` | `desīyate` | The Dhamma is taught by Buddha |
| `Rājena` | `tvaṁ` | `dīyase` | By king, you are given |
| `Rājena` | `tumhe` | `dīyavhe` | By king, you (plural) are given |
| `Raññā` | `ahaṁ` | `dīye` | By king, I am given |
| `Raññā` | `mayaṁ` | `dīyāmhe` | By king, we are given |

### `bhāva` (impersonal) middle voice sentences

It's like a passive voice sentence except the focus is purely on the action
and does not focus on either the subject or object. Therefore the verb tends to
be in ⨀ (`ekavacana`) 🤟 (`paṭhama purisa`) form. If there is a subject, it can
be (but not always) be in 3rd (③) or 6th case (⑥).

| Subject (③) | Verb | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | --- |
| `Devadattena` | `bhūyate` | Devadatta’s being |
| `Pabbatena` | `ṭhīyate` | The mountain’s standing |
| `Purisena` | `kathīyate` | The man's speaking |

### Causative sentences

There are four integral parts in a causative sentence:

1. Causative subject - `Hetu-kattā` (the prompter), or `Payojaka-kattā` (the mover)
2. Subordinate Object - `Kārita-kamma` (causative object)
3. Root-object - `dhātu-kamma`, the object of the root which has direct connection/meaning to the root
4. Causative verb

If the root is a dual-kamma-indicative root (`dvikammaka`) such as `nī` (to
carry), `duha` (to milk), then there can be three objects.

| Causative Subject (①) | Subordinate Object (②) | The root-object (②) | Causative Verb | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `Puriso` | `purisaṁ` | `odanaṁ` | `pāceti` | Man causes the other man to cook the rice |
| `Purisā` | `purise` | `odanaṁ` | `pācenti` | Men cause the other men to cook the rice |

## 🔽 `kibbidhāna` (`kita`-affixed nouns) {524}-{623}

This is a class of words which are verbs transformed into "verb nouns" through
the addition of suffixes.

These "verb nouns" are nouns, and have noun `vibhatti` endings applied to them,
but can function like verbs in a sentence, or as auxiliary verbs such as the
absolutive (also called gerund), the present participle and past participle.

### verbal affixes

| use | affix | rule | voice | `liṅga` |
| --- | :-: | :-: | --- | :-: |
| Verb or adjective | `tabba` | {540} | 🔴 (sometimes 🔵) | variable |

### Individual noun affixes

All of these can be variable gender, even when a gender is specified in the
following table.

| no | affix | rule | gender |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | `ṇa` | { 524, 528, 529} | variable |

### Example

Here is a worked through example of how a root transforms into a `kita`-affixed
noun (from `caja`, using the `ṇa` affix):

`caja` "to share generously"  
→ `caj`~~`a`~~ {521}  
→ `caj` + `ṇa` {529}  
→ `cajṇa` (`kārita`) {621}  
→ `caj`~~`ṇ`~~`a` {523}  
→ `c`~~`a`~~(`ā`)`ja` (`vuddhi`) {483}  
→ `cā`~~`j`~~(`g`)`a` {623}  
→ `cāga` (noun) {601}  
→ `cāga` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `cāga` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `cāg`~~`a`~~ + `o` {83}  
→ `cāgo` ("charitable giving, sharing")

Here is another example based on `budha` (to know):

`budha` "to know"  
→ `budh`~~`a`~~ {521}  
→ `budh` + `ta` {557}  
→ `budh` + ~~`ta`~~(`dha`) {576}  
→ `bu`~~`dh`~~(`d`) + `dha` {611}  
→ `buddha` (noun) {601}  
→ `buddha` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `buddha` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `buddh`~~`a`~~ + `o` {83}  
→ `buddho` ("The one who knows truth, who awakened")

Given the complexity of the above rules, it's probably better just to
recognise the completed forms whenever you come across them, but try and
recognise the affix and associated meaning if you can.

## ⏬ `uṇādi` (`uṇādi`-affixed nouns) {624}-{673}

These are also "verb nouns" that can behave like verbs or auxiliary verbs or
future participles.

The majority of `uṇādi`-affixes, except some verbal affixes, are used mainly in
the formation of individual nouns of varying genders.

Examples:

`sama` "to calm"  
→ `sama` + `tha` {628}  
→ `samatha` {601}  
→ `samatha` + `si` (⨀①)  
→ `samatha` + ~~`si`~~(`o`) {104}  
→ `samath`~~`a`~~ + `o` {83}  
→ `samatho` ("that which calms the mind, Samatha meditation")

`gaha` "to take"  
→ `gah`~~`a`~~ {521}  
→ `g`~~`a`~~(`e`)`ha` {629}  
→ `geha` {601}  
→ `geha` + ~~`si`~~(`aṁ`) {104}  
→ `geh`~~`a`~~ + `aṁ` {219}  
→ `gehaṁ` ("home")

## `sādhana`

The process of attaching either `kita` or `uṇādi` affixes to create new words
is called `sādhana`. Like `kāraka` (the syntax of case or `vibhatti` endings),
`sādhana` affixed words can be associated with specific usage meanings.

`sādhana`-affixed word can be associated with a voice (`kattu`, `kamma`,
`bhāva`), in which case their usage can affect the "voice" of a sentence. This
is especially true when `sādhana`-affixed word is used as a verb-noun, ie. it
carries the "action" of a sentence.

### Example sentences of `kattu` `sādhana`-affixed words

> dānaṁ dinno devadatto

🚻⨀②(dānaṁ) 🚹⨀①(⏬(ta)(dinno) devadatto)  
alms / gave (past participle) / Devadatta  
*Devadatta gave alms.*

>kumaro antepuraṁ gato

🚻⨀②(antepuraṁ) 🚹⨀①(kumaro ⏬(ta)(gato))  
King's palace / prince / went (past participle)  
*The prince went into the King's palace.*

> so bhagavā sayam’pi cattāri saccāni buddho

🚹⨀①(so bhagavā ⏬(ta)(buddho)) ⏏️(sayam api) 🚻⨂②(cattāri saccāni)  
that / Bhagavā  / understood (past participle) / by oneself / just / four / truths  
*That Bhagavā (Buddha) understood the four truths just by himself.*

### Example sentences of `kamma` `sādhana`-affixed words

> buddhena dhammo desito

🚹⨀③(buddhena) 🚹⨀①(dhammo ⏬(ta)(desito))  
by Buddha / dhamma / taught (past participle)  
*The Dhamma is taught by the Buddha.*

> bhotabbo odano bhavatā

🚹⨀①(⏬(tabba)(bhotabbo) odano) 🚹⨀③(bhavatā)  
eaten (future passive participle) / rice / Your Honourable  
*That rice is to be eaten by Your Honourable.*

### Example sentences of `bhāva` `sādhana`-affixed words

> tassa gītaṁ

🚻⨀⑥(tassa) 🚻⨀①(🔽(ta)(gītaṁ))  
of that person / sung (past participle)  
*Sung of that person.*

> sayitabbaṁ bhavatā

🚻⨀①(⏬(tabba)(sayitabbaṁ)) 🚹⨀③(bhavatā)  
eating (future passive particle) / by Your Honourable  
*Eating by Your Honourable.*

### `sādhana` associated meanings and usage

The associated meanings are rather weak compared to case endings (`vibhatti`)
and can sometimes have no significant role.

| association | example | meaning | rule | usage |
| :-: | :-: | --- | :-: | --- |
| `kattu` | `nāyako` | the leader (**who** leads) | {527} | `netī’ti nāyako` |
| `kamma` | `kammaṁ` | work (**which is being done**) | {531} | `karīyate tan’ti kammaṁ` |
| `bhāva` | `cāgo` | generosity (**act of** giving, sharing) | {529} | `cajate, cajanaṁ vā cāgo` |
| `karaṇa` | `vinayo` | the discipline (**by which** one is trained) | {527} | `vineti etenā’ti vinayo` |
| `sampadāna` | `dānīyo` | the recipient monk (**to which** alms should be given) | | `databbo assā’ti dānīyo` |
| `apādāna` | `bhemo` | the fearsome object (**from which** people fear) | {627} | `bhāyanti etasmā’ti bhemo` |
| `adhikaraṇa` | `ṭhānaṁ` | the place (**where** people stand) | {548} | `tiṭṭhanti tasmin’ti` |

## Exercise

Our first exercise, and also a celebration for finishing this chapter, is to
translate the [**Saraṇattaya** Kp 1 PTS 1](https://suttacentral.net/kp1/pli).
This is a very well known `sutta` commonly referred to as the **Three Jewels**
(also known as the **Triple Gem** or **Three Refuges**) and traditionally
recited by disciples of the Buddha as part of a ceremony by which one
formally declares oneself a Buddhist.

> Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Dutiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Dutiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Dutiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi  
> Tatiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi

Let's start by examining only the first line. Analysing each word by
identifying the form of the `vibhatti` ending yields:

> 🚹⨀②(buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ) 🟢⨀🤟▶️(gacchāmi)

{{< alert title="Note" color="secondary">}}
The notation used here is inspired by functional programming conventions.
In mathematics, we refer to \\(f(x)\\) as the function \\(f\\) applying on the
variable \\(x\\), so 🚹⨀②(`x`) means all words in `x` are in the 2nd
case, singular (`ekavacana`) and `pulliṅga` in gender.
Similarly, 🟢⨀🤟▶️(`y`) means all
words in `y` are present indicative (`vattamāna`) active (`parassapada`) verbs
in the singular (`ekavacana`), "first person" (in English, "third person")
form (`paṭhama purisa`).
{{< /alert >}}

Translating each word into English yields:

> Buddha / refuge / (I) go

Note that in Pali, all words in the same case refer to the same entity, so
both "Buddha" and "refuge" refer to the same entity. In other words, the Buddha
is the refuge and the refuge is the Buddha. In English, we can regard the
equality as "Buddha as refuge".

So, rearranging the words into a more idiomatic English sentence, we get:

> *I go to the Buddha as refuge.*

For the exercise, translate the remainder of the `sutta`. It's okay to leave
words like "dhamma" and "sangha" untranslated (and use non-accented characters)
as these are well known terms to Buddhists.

## Answer

> *I go to the Buddha as refuge.  
> I go to the Dhamma as refuge.  
> I go to the Sangha as refuge.  
> For the second time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.  
> For the second time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.  
> For the second time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.  
> For the third time too, I go to the Buddha as refuge.  
> For the third time too, I go to the Dhamma as refuge.  
> For the third time too, I go to the Sangha as refuge.*

Note that `dutiyaṃ` and `tatiyaṃ` are being used as `nipāta`. `pi`is a `nipāta`
meaning "too" or "also".

The sentence structure of this `sutta` can also be represented as a pseudo
UML class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class sentence["dutiyampi/tatiyampi buddhaṃ/dhammaṃ/saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi"] {
    <<vākya>>
    english((For the second/third time) I go to the Buddha/Dhamma/Sangha as refuge)
  }
  namespace saṅkhyāpūraṇa {
    class dutiyaṃ {
      <<nāma>>
      ②
      english(second time)
    }
    class tatiyaṃ {
      <<nāma>>
      ②
      english(third time)
    }
  }
  class pi {
    <<nipāta>>
    english(too)
  }
  namespace saraṇa {
    class buddhaṃ {
      <<nāma>>
      🚹⨀②
    }
    class dhammaṃ {
      <<nāma>>
      🚹⨀②
    }
    class saṅghaṃ {
      <<nāma>>
      🚹⨀②
    }
  }
  class saraṇaṃ {
    <<nāma>>
     🚹⨀②
    english(as refuge)
  }
  class gacchāmi {
    <<ākhyāta>>
     🟢⨀🤟▶️
    english(I go)
  }
  sentence *-- dutiyaṃ
  sentence *-- tatiyaṃ
  sentence *-- pi
  sentence *-- buddhaṃ : kamma
  sentence *-- dhammaṃ : kamma
  sentence *-- saṅghaṃ : kamma
  sentence *-- saraṇaṃ : kamma
  sentence *-- gacchāmi: kiriya
  buddhaṃ .. saraṇaṃ
  dhammaṃ .. saraṇaṃ
  saṅghaṃ .. saraṇaṃ
```

We can also model the successive actions as a pseudo UML sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant ahaṃ as (ahaṃ)
participant buddhaṃ
participant dhammaṃ
participant saṅghaṃ
  loop (paṭhama), dutiyampi, tatiyampi
    ahaṃ ->> buddhaṃ : gacchāmi
    buddhaṃ ->> saraṇaṃ : (hoti)
    ahaṃ ->> dhammaṃ : gacchāmi
    dhammaṃ ->> saraṇaṃ : (hoti)
    ahaṃ ->> saṅghaṃ : gacchāmi
    saṅghaṃ ->> saraṇaṃ : (hoti)
  end
```

Finally, the different states of the refuges can be modelled as a pseudo
UML state diagram:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state fork_state <<fork>>
  state join_state <<join>>
  [*] --> fork_state : gacchāmi
  fork_state --> buddhaṃ
  fork_state --> dhammaṃ
  fork_state --> saṅghaṃ
  buddhaṃ --> join_state
  dhammaṃ --> join_state
  saṅghaṃ --> join_state
  join_state --> saraṇaṃ
  saraṇaṃ --> fork_state : dutiyampi, tatiyampi
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations on finishing this chapter! It is compact and dense, and not
every feature of Pali explained here will sink in initially. It may be
worthwhile revisiting this chapter from time to time to check your understanding
as you progress in your journey in learning Pali.

The good news is you now know enough of the basics of Pali to start reading
the `Tipiṭaka` with the aid of a good dictionary, and looking up every word
as you go along. You may encounter sentences that you can't interpret very
well, but that's okay. Leave it for now, and study the next chapters, which
will help you build confidence and skill in your ability to analyse sentences
and deduce the correct meaning.

Remember, the sentences in the `Tipiṭaka` are often repetitive and used in
similar forms again and again. They are intentionally structured this way
to assist in memorisation and chanting. So, once you have learnt how to
correctly interpret a complex sentence, you may encounter it again and again
and reading will become easier and easier over time.
