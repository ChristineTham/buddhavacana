# Buddhism And Society

* A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes
* Second, Expanded Edition by Melford E. Spiro
* Published by University of California Press in 1970 & 1982


# Preface To The Second Edition

* This book analyzes Buddhism through the lens of current religious theories rather than promoting it as a source of wisdom.
* It focuses on Theravada Buddhism, which differs from the "mystical" Mahayana Buddhism popular in the West today.
*  Theravada Buddhism was initially seen by Western intellectuals as a rational alternative to Christianity and Judaism due to its materialistic metaphysics and denial of a soul or God.

* This form of Buddhism emphasizes individual effort for salvation through meditation and detachment from worldly desires.
* The book explores the unique doctrines of Theravada Buddhism, which challenge conventional religious beliefs about God, the soul, suffering, and salvation.
*  The author's interest in the religion's uniqueness led him to conduct fieldwork in Burma to understand its societal impact.

# Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes

* The book is an anthropological study of Buddhism, focusing on its relationship with society.
* It aims to explain the persistence of Theravada Buddhism in Burma by examining its social, cultural, and psychological conditions.
* The author uses participant observation as a method to understand Buddhism within its Burmese context.
* The book explores discrepancies between Buddhist textual doctrines and actual beliefs and practices of Burmese Buddhists.

# Anthropological Study

* Anthropology differs from other cultural studies in its contextual approach to questions and methods.
* Anthropologists use ethnographic methods, primarily participant observation, to immerse themselves in the culture they study.
* This method is based on the assumptions that human nature is plastic and culture is variable.
* The goal of anthropological research is to explain cultural phenomena within their historical uniqueness.

# Epistemological Relativism

* This philosophy underlies contemporary anthropological theory and suggests that cross-cultural differences preclude generalizations.
* It emphasizes the uniqueness of each social group's history, worldview, and explanatory principles.
* Some anthropologists reject this view but still believe ethnographic methods are essential for uncovering explanatory principles.

# Buddhism and Society

* The title reflects the author's perspective on religion as an existential reality intertwined with other aspects of life.
* The study aims to discover both causal and functional relationships between Buddhism and Burmese society.
* It investigates antecedent conditions for the persistence of Theravada Buddhism in Burma.
* It also explores the consequences of this religion for individuals, social structure, and cultural systems.

# Discrepancies Between Text and Practice

* The author expected to find congruence between Buddhist doctrines and Burmese beliefs but discovered significant discrepancies.
* This finding is reflected in the subtitle, "A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes."
* Similar studies in other Theravada countries have revealed comparable discrepancies.

## Theravāda Buddhism: An Anthropological Problem

* The similarities between Burmese Buddhism and Buddhism in Thailand and Ceylon suggest that the transformations of *Therāvada* Buddhism from a virtuoso to a mass religion are not geographically or culturally restricted.
* This finding challenges the notion that these transformations are unique to Burma.
* The subtitle "Its Burmese Vicissitudes" could be replaced with "Its Asian Vicissitudes," reflecting the broader applicability of the findings.

## Preface To The First Edition

* This book is the second volume in a three-part study on Burma, focusing on Buddhism.
* The author's interest in Buddhism stems from his earlier research on Israeli kibbutzim and their otherworldly orientation.
* The study was supported by various grants and fellowships.

## Acknowledgments

* The author expresses gratitude to numerous individuals and institutions for their support and contributions.
* He acknowledges the influence of A. I. Hallowell, Max Weber, and Sigmund Freud on his work.
* He thanks his wife, colleagues, assistants, and Burmese informants for their invaluable help.

## A Note On The Spelling, Pronunciation And Use Of Foreign Terms And Texts

* Foreign terms are generally translated into English to avoid overwhelming the reader with unfamiliar words.
* Sanskrit terms are preferred over Pali or Burmese equivalents when suitable English approximations are unavailable.
* The transcription system used for Burmese is based on the work of Maran La Raw and F. K. Lehman.




## Introduction

* Few scholarly works on Buddhism take an anthropological perspective.
* While historical and textual studies are important for anthropologists, they do not constitute a complete anthropological treatment of Buddhism.
* Anthropologists need to examine the interaction between Buddhist doctrines and the beliefs of religious devotees, as well as the relationship between these beliefs and social and cultural life.

## 3

* Contemporary anthropological studies of Buddhism often ignore normative Buddhist sources, leading to a missed opportunity to understand the challenge posed by doctrinal Buddhism.
* Ignoring the historical roots of Buddhism can lead to methodological absurdities in anthropological research.
* This study aims to bridge the gap between textual scholarship and anthropological fieldwork by examining the relationship between Buddhist doctrines and the beliefs of Buddhist actors.

##  

* The study explores three types of interaction between religious actors and normative religious doctrines: acceptance, rejection, and assimilation.
* Understanding these interactions is crucial for comprehending the role of religious ideas in human affairs.

## 

* This study addresses the problem of cultural change and conservatism in Buddhism, particularly how a revolutionary religion like Buddhism can revert to traditional beliefs.

##  

* The study focuses on the interaction between the "great tradition" of Theravada Buddhism and the people of Burma.
* While emphasizing beliefs and ideas, the study recognizes that religious behavior is ultimately dependent on religious ideas.

## 

* This study's focus on ideas differs from current anthropological trends like Levi-Strauss's structuralism or ethnoscience.
* The author argues that religious ideas are not primarily used for thinking or classifying but rather for living by, providing meaning and coping mechanisms in life's challenges.

## The Problem: The Uniqueness Of Buddhism

* Normative Buddhism exists in two major forms: *Mahāyāna* (Greater Vehicle) and *Therāvada* (Elders' Vehicle). 
* This study focuses on *Therāvada* Buddhism, found primarily in Southeast Asia.
* "Normative *Therāvada* Buddhism" refers to the doctrines contained in the *Therāvada* canon, regardless of their historical accuracy.

## The Uniqueness Of Buddhism

* Normative *Therāvada* Buddhism is unique due to its distinctive doctrines and attitudes.
* Some scholars question whether it can be classified as a religion at all.
* This study aims to explore the problems posed by this unique religious tradition.

## Defining Doctrines of Buddhism

* J. H. Bateson summarizes Buddhist teachings in five concepts: materialism, atheism, pessimism, nihilism, and egoism.
* World-renunciation is added as a consequence of these doctrines.

## Materialism

* Buddhism denies the existence of a soul.
* Man is an aggregate of material factors that disintegrate at death.
* The building block of both man and the world is the atom.

## Atheism

* Buddhism lacks a God or creator deity.
* There is no savior God to whom one can turn for salvation.
* Each individual must achieve salvation independently.

## Nihilism

* Buddhism asserts that everything in the universe is impermanent, including any potential reality.
* Even if immortality existed, it wouldn't be a desirable goal.
* The aim of Buddhism is to end the cycle of rebirth and achieve extinction of existence.

## Pessimism

* Suffering is an inherent part of life, according to Buddhist teachings.
* Even seemingly happy experiences are ultimately painful when analyzed through Buddhist meditation.
* The only way to escape suffering is to extinguish life as we know it.

## Renunciation

* Buddhism views attachment to the world as the cause of suffering and a barrier to salvation.
* It advocates detachment from persons, possessions, and even oneself.
* This emphasis on renunciation makes Buddhism a religion of otherworldly asceticism.




# Theravada Buddhism: A Problem Confounded

* The author initially saw *Theravada* Buddhism as a unique case study for understanding how cultural and social conditions influence religious beliefs.
* However, further research revealed that many doctrines of *Theravada* Buddhism were not widely internalized by its followers in Southeast Asia.
* This led the author to conclude that Buddhists are not significantly different from people in general in terms of their beliefs and behavior.

# The Problem Confounded: The Three Systems Of *Theravada* Buddhism

*  Ancient Indian culture had two religious systems: an "ordinary norm" for the majority and an "extraordinary norm" for those seeking salvation (release from the cycle of rebirth).
* Normative Buddhism, aiming for release, developed alongside a nonnormative system focused on improving one's position within the cycle of rebirth.

* A third system, apotropaic Buddhism, focuses on worldly welfare, such as protection from danger.
* These three systems—nibbanic (normative), kammatic (nonnormative), and apotropaic—coexist within Buddhism, though individuals may prioritize one over the others.

# Limits to Cultural Plasticity

* The author argues that while culture shapes human nature, there are limits to its influence.
* Despite centuries of Buddhist teachings emphasizing detachment and otherworldliness, people in Buddhist societies exhibit similar traits to those in Western cultures, such as attachment and drive-satisfaction.
* This suggests that certain aspects of human nature may be more universal than previously thought.

# The Conventionalization of Religion

* Religious institutions tend to become more alike over time, losing the unique characteristics of their founders' teachings.
* This "conventionalization" process leads to a convergence of religious systems, despite initial differences in doctrines.

# Buddhism's Reversion to Indian Beliefs

* Buddhism has reverted to many Indian beliefs against which its founder rebelled.
* This reversion has led Buddhism to incorporate most attributes usually associated with religion, such as souls, gods, rituals, and heavens and hells.
* Buddhism, even in its current form, is still different from other religions but shares similarities due to its association with other belief systems in the societies where it exists.

# Field Work: The Burmese Setting

* To study religion as a living system, fieldwork was conducted in Burma, specifically in the village of Yeigyi.
* The village setting was chosen for its manageability and because it represents a typical expression of Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia.
* Data was collected not only from Yeigyi but also from other villages in Upper Burma, Mandalay (a traditional city), and Rangoon (the modern capital) to allow for comparisons across spatial, ecological, cultural, and temporal dimensions.

# Generalizability of Findings

* Comparisons revealed that Buddhism in Rangoon differs little from Buddhism in Yeigyi, and both are similar to traditional Burmese Buddhism.
* The Buddhism practiced in Yeigyi is considered a typical expression of Theravada Buddhism found throughout Burma.
* Similarities were also observed between Burmese Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism in Thailand and Ceylon, suggesting that the findings can be generalized to other Theravada Buddhist societies.

# Socio-Cultural Context of Yeigyi

* Yeigyi is a village with approximately 500 people engaged primarily in wet rice cultivation.
* Located near Mandalay, it has been influenced by both traditional Burmese culture and British colonialism.
* Despite experiencing political upheavals and modernization efforts, the village retains its traditional social structure, economy, and religious practices.
* Buddhism remains a central force in the village, alongside spirit religion and other occult beliefs.





## Field Work: The Buddhist Setting

* Buddhism is deeply ingrained in Burmese society, having been the official religion since the 11th century and playing a dominant role in culture and daily life.
* Burma has hosted significant events in Buddhist history, including the Fifth and Sixth Buddhist Councils and the development of modern meditation techniques.
* Despite British colonial efforts to diminish its influence, Buddhism remained strong and continues to be a central force in post-independence Burma.

## The Cultural Significance of Buddhism

* Burmese culture is heavily influenced by Buddhism, evident in language, literature, art, architecture, and traditional conceptions of society.
* Buddhist themes permeate Burmese literature, with the Jataka tales being particularly influential in folklore, drama, and classical theater.
* Burmese art, sculpture, and painting are largely inspired by Buddhist motifs, while architecture showcases pagodas and monasteries as prominent features.

## Buddhism's Impact on Individual Lives

* Buddhism plays a significant role in the personal lives of Burmese people, evident in financial contributions to temples, high rates of monastic ordination, and the importance of piety for political success.
* Being Buddhist is integral to Burmese identity, with non-Buddhists often perceived as less Burmese, even if they hold prominent positions in society.

## Buddhism as a Normative Force

* Buddhist scriptures, particularly the Jataka tales, serve as a moral compass for villagers, providing guidance on issues like factionism, leadership, and sacrifice.
* Even political leaders utilize Buddhist teachings to justify their actions, demonstrating the pervasive influence of Buddhism on decision-making.

## The Enduring Fascination with Buddhism

* Burmese people exhibit a deep fascination with Buddhism, engaging in lengthy discussions about its doctrines and practices.
* These conversations provide valuable insights into the beliefs and concerns of ordinary Burmese, highlighting the centrality of Buddhism in their daily lives.





# Nevertheless, although the "noise" factor in Buddhist discussions is important for the light it sheds on Burmese character, it does not weaken the claim concerning the importance of Buddhism in Burma. Even "noise" is in a Buddhist key! A key, it should be added, which is sounded over and over again.

* The same concepts may be discussed repeatedly without new ideas being added.
* This repetition is less surprising when realizing that Buddhist doctrines are of great interest to the Burmese.
* Knowing and explaining these doctrines is a mark of prestige in Burma.
* This indicates the paramount importance of Buddhism in village Burma.

# Field Work: The Research Problems And The Data

* The data consists of ceremonies, holidays, discussions overheard, and responses to questions asked by the anthropologist.
* These observations provide a picture of religion as it is lived and suggest additional beliefs, problems, and paradoxes to be studied.

* An extensive Buddhist interview schedule was administered in almost every household in Yeigyi, and to selected informants in other villages.

* This schedule collected information concerning the beliefs and practices of Buddhist adults, their awareness of formal doctrines, and their attitudes toward them.
* A less extensive interview schedule was administered to twenty randomly selected school children aged seven to twelve.
* This investigated the developmental aspect of Buddhist belief systems.

* An intensive interview schedule was administered to a small panel of fifteen village men who were knowledgeable about Buddhism.
* These men were selected because of their extensive Buddhist knowledge, piety, and interest in Buddhist philosophy and metaphysics.
* They are referred to as the "blue-ribbon sample" and are the most knowledgeable Buddhists in the village.

* The study also focused on monastic Buddhism.
* Observations were made at three monasteries in Yeigyi.
* Informal interviews were conducted with monks in various locations.
* A smaller group of twenty-one monks underwent intensive study, including an interview schedule, psychological tests, and information gathering about their backgrounds and reasons for entering the Order.
* Interviews were also conducted with leaders of "political monk" associations and officials from the Ministry of Religion.

* The data raised several problems:
    * Why are some normative doctrines rejected while others are accepted?
    * How do the faithful resolve the tension between their normative and actual religion?
    * Why are doctrines that are rejected still transmitted generation after generation?
* The research also explored doctrinal problems related to living Buddhism, such as:

    * What conditions account for the internalization of these doctrines?
    * What social and cultural consequences flow from belief in them?

* Finally, the research investigated Buddhist monks and monasticism:

    * How do monks differ from lay Buddhists?
    * What functions does monasticism serve for both monks and laymen?
    * Why does a worldly society like Burma revere those who live by otherworldly norms?

* The book aims to explain Burmese Buddhism as both the dependent and independent variable.

* It attempts to explain Burmese Buddhism by means of features of Burmese society and personality, and to discover the effects that Buddhism has had on Burmese culture and society.
* The book includes detailed accounts of Buddhist belief and behavior, which may be relevant to the research problems.

## Some Problems In Interpretation

* Religion should be studied scientifically like other cultural systems.
* This scientific approach can be upsetting to those accustomed to homiletic interpretations.
* Scientific explanations of religion do not reduce religion to its constituent parts but seek to understand it in terms of antecedent variables.

## Nibbanic Buddhism: A Religion Of Radical Salvation

*  Buddhism is a complex system with many paths, making it difficult to summarize comprehensively.
* This chapter focuses on Theravada Buddhism and draws from both textual sources and discussions with Burmese monks.
* The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, was the last of twenty-eight Buddhas in this world cycle.
* He taught the path to Deliverance for forty years before attaining complete salvation (parinibbana). 
* The Buddha is not a God or Savior but a historical figure who discovered the means to achieve Deliverance.




## 31

* The Buddha stands alone in Buddhism, there are no saints, only the great teacher who saw the light.
* Buddhism is named after the Buddha, either as "the worship of the Buddha" or "the doctrine of the Buddha".
* Despite discovering the Path to Liberation, the Buddha is not considered God in Theravada tradition but a human being who achieved enlightenment.

## 32

* The Buddha is not a god in the Hindu-Buddhist or Judaeo-Christian sense. He is superior to Hindu-Buddhist gods because he achieved liberation, while they are still subject to rebirth.
* Unlike Christ, the Buddha died and was not resurrected. He entered nirvana upon death, a state where "life" as ordinarily understood does not apply.

## 33

* Although human, the Buddha was extraordinary, achieving Nirvana and Buddhahood, a rare feat requiring four hundred million aeons of rebirths.
* To achieve Buddhahood, one must attain Ten Perfections (dana, sila, nekkhamma, panna, viriya, khanti, sacca, adhitthana, metta, upekkha) and possess Nine Virtues.

## 34

* The Buddha is not a savior but a signpost showing the Way to salvation.
* He encourages self-reliance and following the Dhamma (Teaching) as the path to enlightenment.
* Burmese Buddhists generally share this view, emphasizing the importance of individual effort and the Dhamma over praying to the Buddha for salvation.



## The Promise: Deliverance From Suffering The Premise: Life Is Suffering
* Buddhism promises deliverance from suffering.
* Suffering is one of three inevitable attributes of sentient existence, along with impermanence and egolessness.

## Impermanence

* Everything is impermanent (anicca).
* Creation and dissolution are constant processes at all levels of existence.
* This contrasts with Hinduism's belief in a permanent ground of being (Brahman) and an unchanging soul (atman).

## Nonself

* Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent self or soul (anatta).
* A person consists of five impermanent components: matter, feeling, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness.
* The belief in a permanent self is an illusion that must be overcome for liberation.

## Suffering

* Sentient existence is characterized by suffering (dukkha), the most important characteristic from a religious perspective.
* Life is inherently suffering due to impermanence and the absence of a self.
* All experiences, both pleasurable and nonpleasurable, lead to suffering because they are temporary.
* Even pleasurable experiences cannot compensate for the four inevitable conditions of suffering: birth, illness, old age, and death.



## The Aim: Release From Rebirth

* Suffering is central to Buddhism, not sin as in some religions.
* Buddhism sees suffering as inevitable and something to be avoided.
* Salvation in Buddhism means release from suffering.

## That Suffering Can Be Eliminated By The Elimination Of Desire

*  Eliminating desire extinguishes suffering. This is the third Noble Truth.
* Detachment (upekkha) from all things, avoiding craving and clinging, leads to the cessation of desire.
* An example is a monk who detached himself emotionally from his family to avoid suffering caused by their potential wealth or poverty.

## The Nature Of Suffering And Desire

* Suffering arises from the delusion of selfhood.
* Realizing the truth of nonself (emptiness) eliminates clinging and craving, thus ending suffering.
* Buddhism's message is ontological, not just psychological.

## Release From Rebirth

* Death does not end suffering; it leads to rebirth in one of thirty-one planes of existence.
* The Wheel of Existence (samsara) comprises these planes, including heavens, human realm, and states of woe.
* Rebirth is an inescapable fact of nature for Buddhists.

## The Cause Of Rebirth: Desire

* Deliverance from suffering requires release from the Wheel of Existence.
* Desire (tanha) causes rebirth by clinging to present existence and craving future ones.
* Buddhism's message is eschatological, stating that extinguishing desire leads to release from rebirth and thus from suffering.



## Karma And Rebirth




## The Means: Extinction Of Karma

* Every volitional act (kamma) produces an appropriate consequence, desirable or undesirable, based on desire.
* There are two types of volitional acts: morally good (kusala) and morally bad (akusala).
* Merit (pufifia) is produced by morally good action, while demerit (apufifia) is produced by morally bad action.
* The fruit (vipaka) of meritorious action yields pleasant consequences, while the fruit of demeritorious action yields unpleasant consequences.
* If these karmic consequences cannot work themselves out within one life, they must be worked out in successive lives.

* Rebirth takes place as long as the law of karma is operative.
* The law of karma applies only to those volitional acts which are instigated by desire.
* An act, although volitional, which is performed without the intention of satisfying desire, produces no karmic consequence.
* The only way to destroy the fruits of action—and thereby prevent rebirth—is to destroy its roots, i.e., to extinguish desire.

## The Technique: The Buddhist Path The First Stage: Morality

* Release from the round of rebirth is achieved by the extinction of desire (or detachment).
* To achieve detachment, one must come to understand that he has no self to cling to, that all existence is impermanent, and that therefore desire can only lead to suffering.
* This understanding is attained through the Noble Eightfold Path, which comprises three stages: morality, meditation, and wisdom.

* Morality (sila) does not in itself lead to Deliverance unless practiced with detachment.
* Morality produces self-discipline (sikkha), or character training, which is a necessary condition for achieving the next two stages on the Path.
* The Buddhist precepts (sila), which comprise the core of Buddhist morality, include three sets of prohibitions: a minimum set of five, and an expanded set of eight or ten.

* The Five Precepts include abstention from killing, stealing, illicit sexual relations, lying, and imbibing any intoxicant conducive to "slothfulness."
* Buddhism interdicts the killing of all beings, not merely human beings. This stems from its concept of metta, or loving-kindness.
* Burmese Buddhists generally avoid occupations that involve killing, such as slaughterers, hunters, and fishermen.

* Beyond the Five Precepts, every Buddhist must periodically observe the Eight Precepts. These include the five already mentioned and an additional four: abstention from all sexual relations, taking any food after the noon hour, watching or participating in any form of theatrical entertainment, the wearing of perfume and jewelry, and sleeping on a high or ornate bed.
* The Ten Precepts comprise the above eight (or nine) with the added abstention from the handling of money.

* Buddhist morality is concerned not so much with abstention from immoral acts as with the extinction of the desires that instigate them.
* Intention (cetana) is crucial in nibbanic Buddhism, because an immoral act committed in the mind is in itself an act of immorality.

## The Second Dimension: Mental Impurities

* Buddhist morality aims to destroy "mental impurities" (kilesa) like greed, hatred, and ignorance.
* This destruction is both the goal and a necessary condition for moral action.
* These impurities are frequently cited as causes of societal problems in Burma.

## The Third Dimension: Detachment

* Destroying mental impurities leads to detachment (upekkha), the only valued emotional state in nibbanic Buddhism.
* Unlike other religions, Buddhist behavior is governed by detachment rather than love.
* While love is morally good and produces merit, it still leads to rebirth and suffering.
* Only detachment ends the cycle of rebirth and suffering.

## The Second Stage: Meditation

* Meditation (bhavana) follows morality on the path to nirvana.
* It has two aspects: tranquility (samatha) and insight (vipassana).
* Insight is crucial for attaining wisdom (panna), necessary for achieving nirvana.

* Tranquility meditation aims to calm the restless mind through concentration on various objects.
* This allows one to achieve a state of one-pointedness, free from distractions.
* Insight meditation builds upon tranquility and leads to understanding the true nature of reality.




# Mindfulness Meditation

* This method involves paying close attention to every action, thought, sensation, and emotion.
* It aims to achieve complete concentration on the present moment by focusing on details of physical actions like walking.

# Mindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)

* A variant of mindfulness meditation where one focuses solely on their breath, either at the nostrils or abdomen.
* This practice cultivates total concentration and awareness of impermanence within the body.

# Samadhi: State of Total Concentration

* Samadhi is a state of deep absorption achieved through meditation.
* It is characterized by guarded senses, self-possession, contentment, and freedom from hindrances like lust, malice, sloth, worry, and doubt.

# From Tranquility to Insight Meditation (Vipassana)

* While samadhi offers temporary transcendence of negative emotions, it doesn't lead to permanent extinction.
* Vipassana meditation is necessary for achieving lasting liberation by cultivating insight into the three Buddhist truths: impermanence, non-self, and suffering.

# Vipassana: Insight Meditation

* Vipassana involves analyzing meditational experiences through the lens of the three Buddhist truths.
* This leads to an intuitive understanding that there is no permanent self, all experiences are fleeting, and true happiness is unattainable in this world (suffering).

# Wisdom and Deliverance

* The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the destruction of craving for worldly things, which leads to suffering.
* This wisdom arises from direct experience of impermanence, non-self, and suffering, leading to a loss of desire for samsaric existence.

# Deliverance Through Meditation

* Deliverance (Nirvana) is achieved by extinguishing craving through meditation.
* The Buddha emphasizes meditation as the sole path to purification, transcending grief and misery, and realizing Nirvana.

## A Note On Meditation In Burma

* Insight-meditation is practiced by monks in meditation monasteries, laymen seeking instruction from them, and monks living in forest hermitages.
* Monks and laymen observe the Ten Precepts while meditating.
* The typical regimen involves waking at 4:00 a.m., alms rounds for monks, study time, didactic lessons from the head meditation master, reporting experiences to personal masters, and private meditation for about twelve hours.

* Regimens in forest hermitages are self-imposed, with some meditating continuously for eight hours or dividing their time into two periods of meditation.
* Monks begin meditating at various ages, some late in life while others start as teenagers.
* Lay meditators practice mindfulness daily or enter monasteries periodically for intensive meditation.

* Few monks claim to have achieved insight (vipassana), and those who do are reluctant to describe it.
* Laymen often report itching sensations, sharp pains, expanding organs, hearing voices, and visions during meditation.




## The Goal: Nirvana

* Deliverance from suffering and rebirth.
* Release from the Wheel of Rebirth.
* Negative formulation: cessation of rebirth and its ills.
* Positive qualities are debated among scholars.

## Or, Again:

*  Some scholars argue that nirvana means total annihilation.
* Others believe it refers to an "inconceivable existence" or both.
* Burmese Buddhists hold diverse views on the meaning of nirvana (neikban).
* Some say it is indescribable and can only be experienced.
* Others believe it is not extinction but a state of bliss or purified spirit.

## Nibbanic Buddhism: A Religion of Radical Salvation 

*  Analogical explanation using space as an example.
* Individuality is artificial and broken down through enlightenment.
* Nirvana is the merging with the totality of Being.





## The Personal Ideal: The Arahant

* The text outlines the stages one must pass through to attain nirvana in Buddhism.
* It describes the four stages: Sotapanna (Stream-winner), Sakadagamin (Once-returner), Anagamin (Non-returner), and Arahant.
* Each stage involves the diminishing or elimination of fetters that bind one to the cycle of rebirth.

## The Arahant Compared with a Buddha

* While both achieve nirvana, an arahant follows the path taught by a Buddha, while a Buddha discovers it independently.
* A Buddha attains omniscience, universal knowledge, and omnipotence, which an arahant does not.
* An arahant is solely concerned with their own Deliverance, unlike a Buddha who seeks to enlighten others.

## Criticism of the Arahant Ideal

* The arahant ideal is criticized for being selfish as it focuses on individual salvation without concern for others.
* Mahavana Buddhism criticizes both the Silent Buddha and the arahant for lacking love and compassion for all beings.

## The Bodhisattva Ideal

* In contrast to the arahant, the Bodhisattva delays nirvana to help others attain Deliverance by transferring merit.
* This selfless devotion is considered the essence of Bodhisattvahood.

## Justification for the Arahant Ideal

* The arahant ideal logically follows from Buddhist teachings on karma and merit, where individual actions determine one's destiny.
* Nirvana is achieved through self-transformation, not mechanical merit transfer as suggested by the Bodhisattva ideal.

## Compassion in Theravada Buddhism

* Although the Bodhisattva ideal is absent in Theravada Buddhism, qualities like love and compassion are still emphasized.
* The Buddha Gautama serves as a model of compassion, sharing his wisdom to guide others towards salvation.

## Aspiration to Buddhahood in Burma

* Despite the rarity of becoming a Buddha, there is a tradition of aspiring to Sammasam (Perfect) Buddhahood in Burma.
* Some Burmese express a desire to take others with them to nirvana as Buddhas.

## Conclusion

* Most Burmese aspire to arahantship, focusing on their own Deliverance.
* This aspiration is not necessarily selfish, similar to a Christian's pursuit of personal salvation.

## The Social Ideal: World Renunciation

* Salvation religions can adopt different stances towards the world.
* Normative Buddhism rejects the world in all its forms as an obstacle to salvation.
* True Buddhists are world-rejectors who renounce worldly attachments and live as monks.
* This renunciation does not involve self-torture but rather a rejection of worldly values and societal norms.

## Kammatic Buddhism: I. A Religion Of Proximate Salvation

* Nibbanic Buddhism, the normative ideology of Theravada Buddhism, is a radical form of salvation striving that involves transcending the world.
* However, this ideology has undergone changes in practice due to its diffusion among less sophisticated populations.
* Kammatic Buddhism, practiced by most contemporary Theravada Buddhists, focuses on achieving proximate salvation within the world.
* Instead of extinguishing desire, they aim for a better rebirth where their desires can be fulfilled.



## The Normative Basis For Kammatic Buddhism

* Kammatic Buddhism is not a completely new creation but rather a reinterpretation of existing nibbanic Buddhist doctrines.
* It emphasizes certain elements of nibbanic Buddhism while modifying or rejecting others.
* This shift reflects the psychological needs and social context of the religious masses.

## The Psychological Basis For Kammatic Buddhism A Conceptual Framework

* Religious actors tend to modify or reinterpret doctrines to align with their own cognitive, perceptual, and motivational structures rather than outright reject them.
* Acceptance of doctrines is influenced by:
    * Consistency with personal experiences and social relations.
    * Ability to satisfy the needs and motivations of the faithful.
* Doctrines inconsistent with these structures are likely to be rejected or accepted without strong conviction.

## A Psychological Explanation

* Early Buddhism was followed by "well-educated intellectuals" from privileged backgrounds who sought an escape from worldly pleasures.
* Contemporary Buddhists, unlike early followers, often prioritize worldly happiness and seek fulfillment of desires rather than renunciation.

## Theoretical Expectations

* Individuals disillusioned with worldly pleasures may find solace in world-rejecting ideologies like nibbanic Buddhism.
* Those whose desires remain unfulfilled would likely pursue their satisfaction rather than renounce them.

## Empirical Evidence from Burma

* Burmese Buddhists often reject the Buddhist concept of impermanence as it applies to the self, instead seeking pleasant future rebirths.
* The doctrine of non-self is not widely accepted in Burma, with most believing in a real and desirable persistent self.
* Burmese Buddhists view the frustration of desire as the source of suffering, aiming for its fulfillment rather than extinction.
* Nirvana, the ultimate goal in nibbanic Buddhism, is less appealing to Burmese who prefer continued samsaric existence with guaranteed pleasure.

## Shift in Buddhist Ideology

* This section will delve into the transformation of *Therāvada* Buddhism from a nibbanic to a kammatic soteriology, moving from a focus on otherworldly salvation to proximate worldly salvation. 




## The Shift In The Conception Of Dukkha

* Nibbanic Buddhism emphasizes suffering as inherent to worldly existence and advocates for its extinction through detachment from desires. 
* This interpretation contrasts with the lived experiences of many Buddhists, particularly in Burma, who find pleasure in worldly pursuits despite acknowledging the presence of suffering.
* Burmese Buddhists often view suffering as a result of frustrated desires rather than desire itself.

## Kammatic Buddhism: I. A Religion Of Proximate Salvation

* Burmese Buddhists generally aspire to rebirth in favorable realms like those of wealthy humans or devas, believing these states offer significant pleasure.
* They acknowledge the Buddhist doctrine of karma but interpret it as a means to achieve better rebirths through accumulating good karma rather than extinguishing desire.
* Practices like extending lifespan through occult methods are common, reflecting a desire for prolonged enjoyment in this world.

## The Doctrine Of Suffering As A Fulcrum

* The interpretation of suffering as either inherent to all existence or capable of being mitigated within samsara determines the direction of Buddhist practice.
* Nibbanic Buddhism seeks transcendence of suffering through nirvana, while kammatic Buddhism aims for pleasant rebirths within samsara.
* Burmese Buddhists lean towards kammatic Buddhism, prioritizing worldly pleasures and seeking favorable rebirths through good karma. 




## The Shift In The Conception Of Nirvana

* Nirvana is an ambiguous concept in Buddhism and its attainment means the cessation of samsaric existence. Attitudes towards it depend on one's conception of nirvana and samsara.

* If samsara is seen as suffering, then nirvana (as extinction) becomes desirable. However, if some forms of samsara are pleasurable, desire for nirvana depends on comparing pleasures in both states.
* In Burma, most Buddhists reject the Buddhist doctrine of suffering. They have two attitudes towards nirvana: those who see it as total extinction reject it, while others transform it into a blissful state, a superheaven.

## Nirvana As Extinction

* Although Buddhism is cited by proponents of cultural relativism to disprove the universal desire for immortality, this argument finds little support from Buddhists.
* Most Theravada Buddhists who conceive of nirvana as extinction do not desire it, preferring pleasurable rebirth instead. This preference is found throughout the Theravada world.
* Some Burmese monks aspire to nirvana precisely because they see it as extinction, seeking an end to suffering.

## The Conflict Between Normative Expectation and Personal Desire

* Burmese Buddhists are taught that life is suffering and nirvana is the ultimate goal. However, many desire a pleasurable rebirth instead. This creates a conflict between normative expectations and personal desires.
* While most Burmese express a preference for nirvana rhetorically, they often feel guilty about desiring worldly pleasures. They may defer their desire for nirvana, claiming to want it only after enjoying earthly pleasures.

## Rejection of Nirvana

* Some Burmese reject the doctrine of nirvana altogether, finding the idea of extinction boring or undesirable.

## Discrepancy Between Interview Responses and Real-Life Attitudes

* When asked directly, most Burmese say they desire nirvana in their next existence. This contradicts their expressed preference for pleasurable rebirth in non-interview settings.
* This discrepancy can be explained by normative and rhetorical pressures to express a desire for nirvana, as well as the fact that many Burmese view nirvana not as extinction but as a blissful state.

# Kammatic Buddhism: I. A Religion of Proximate Salvation

* Nirvana is often viewed as a kind of superparadise by Burmese Buddhists.
* This interpretation is supported by the fact that many respondents who chose nirvana as their first choice for their next existence also chose hedonistic goals as their second choice.
* The majority of male respondents who did not choose nirvana as their first choice desired some form of physical pleasure in their next life.

# Nirvana as a Superheaven

* Female respondents overwhelmingly chose hedonistic goals when asked about their desires for the next existence, even those who initially chose nirvana.
* This suggests that many Burmese Buddhists have transformed the traditional Buddhist dichotomy between samsara and nirvana into a hedonistic continuum.

# Ontological Dichotomy

* In kammatic Buddhism, the ontological distinction between samsara and nirvana is blurred. 
* While some still see them as separate entities, they are now conceived of as occupying different positions on the same plane rather than existing on separate planes.

# Prerequisites for Samsara and Nirvana

* Unlike traditional Buddhist thought, which emphasizes the extinction of karma for attaining nirvana, kammatic Buddhism believes that both samsara and nirvana are attained through the accumulation of merit.
* This belief is reflected in the respondents' emphasis on accumulating merit as a means to reach nirvana.

# Children's Conception of Nirvana

* Most children surveyed had little or no understanding of nirvana.
* Those who did have some concept of it viewed it as a superparadise, a place of ultimate joy and pleasure. 




## The Shift In The Conception Of Anatta

* The doctrine of nonself (anatta) is crucial in Buddhist ontology and achieving nirvana.
* Burmese Buddhists largely reject the concept of anatta, confusing it with impermanence.
* While acknowledging the impermanence of "mind" or "soul," many Burmese believe in a permanent "butterfly spirit" that survives death and undergoes rebirth.

## The Paradox Of Rebirth And Nonself

* Buddhism's acceptance of rebirth while rejecting a permanent self creates a paradox: if there is no continuous identity, why should one care about future rebirths?
* This paradox poses a significant challenge to kammatic Buddhism, which relies on the concept of karmic retribution.
* Burmese Buddhists offer several solutions to this paradox:

    * **Existence of a soul (nan-dei.ya):** A substantial essence persists through rebirths, experiencing karmic consequences. However, this contradicts the doctrine of nonself.
    * **Continuity despite lack of identity:** The new being is aware of its past existence, creating a sense of continuity. This solution is limited by the rarity of individuals remembering past lives.

    * **Distinction between appearance and reality:** From a worldly perspective, a soul exists and experiences karma. This solution is seen as deceptive.
    * **Survival of khandhas:** The physical components (khandhas) survive death and experience karmic consequences. This contradicts the doctrine of impermanence.

    * **Reified consciousness:** A disklike element in the blood carries consciousness, which produces a "spark" igniting new life, creating moral identity across rebirths. This solution is inconsistent with reported cases of rebirth including memories of past identities.





# Kammatic Buddhism: I. A Religion of Proximate Salvation
* Most Burmese are unaware of the meaning of anatta (non-self).
* Those who understand it find it difficult to accept its consequences as it undermines their soteriological aspirations and the renunciations required by Buddhist morality. 
* They believe in an enduring soul that experiences karmic retribution across rebirths, either as a pre-Buddhist leikpya or nama (derived from but inconsistent with normative Buddhist metaphysics).

# Kammatic Buddhism: Ii. The Central Concept Of Merit
* Burmese perception of impermanence is based on their experience of themselves and others.
* They believe that mental states are fickle and changeable, leading to the generalization that nothing is permanent.
* Interpersonal relationships are also seen as evanescent, with friendships potentially turning into enmity.

# From Salvation Through Knowledge to Salvation Through Works 
* The shift in soteriological goal from nibbanic to kammatic Buddhism led to changes in the conception of soteriological action.
* In nibbanic Buddhism, salvation is achieved through knowledge (panna) obtained through meditation, aiming for the extinction of karma and rebirth cessation.
* Kammatic Buddhism prioritizes merit acquisition through giving (dana) and morality (sila) to improve karma and achieve a happy rebirth. 



## The Conceptual Centrality Of Merit

* Karma is viewed as the ultimate determinant of salvation in kammatic Buddhism.
* Merit (ku.thou) and demerit (aku.thou) are the building blocks of this belief system. 
* While some Burmese Buddhists who aspire to nirvana downplay merit, the vast majority see it as crucial for attaining salvation.

## Merits Acquisition

* Merit is acquired through charity (da-na.), morality (thi-la), and meditation (ba-wa-na).
* This differs from nibbanic Buddhism where wisdom (panna) is the means to salvation, with merit being a byproduct of actions leading to wisdom.

## Alternative Conceptions of Merit Acquisition

* One Burmese conception views giving, morality, and meditation as a ladder to salvation, enhancing karma through merit acquisition.
* Another sees these as alternative paths: giving/morality (kan-lan:) for samsaric rebirth, meditative trance (zan-lan:) for nirvana through merit, and insight-meditation (nyan-lan:) for nirvana through wisdom (which is also seen as producing merit).

## The Centrality of Merit

*  The shift from nibbanic to kammatic Buddhism has led to a focus on merit.
* For some, the goal is samsaric rebirth; for others, it's nirvana achieved through merit-producing actions.
* This emphasis on merit is reflected in the merging of the terms "good" (kusala) and "merit" (punna) into a single concept.



## Means For Acquiring Merit: Morality Morality And Merit

* The Burmese believe that merit from giving and morality leads to a better rebirth.
* Morality can lead to a long life, while giving can lead to wealth or becoming a deva.
* There are two ways to acquire morality-based merit: living according to Buddhist precepts or taking an oath to comply with them.

## Buddhism And Moral Behavior

*  While all five precepts are important, there is no agreement on their order of importance among monks and laymen.
* Some monks believe killing is the most important precept to follow, while others believe it's abstaining from alcohol.
* One abbot argued that lying is the most important precept to avoid, citing scriptural evidence and stories like the Cetiva Jataka.
* Laymen generally consider adultery to be the most important precept to follow.
* Men tend to view stealing as the least important precept, while women view drinking as less important.
* While Burmese villagers recognize the importance of the precepts, they don't see them as the primary way to obtain merit.
* Giving (dana) is widely considered the best way to acquire merit.

## Demerit

* The most frequently cited demeritorious act is violating one or more of the five precepts.
*  Killing is considered the most serious violation, followed by drinking and illicit sex (for males) and stealing (for females).

## Means for Acquiring Merit: Giving

* Giving (dana) is the primary means for acquiring merit in kammatic Buddhism.
* Burmese prioritize giving over morality as a way to gain merit.
* This preference stems from several factors:
    * Morality's negative formulation makes it ambiguous and difficult to quantify.
    * Giving is measurable, allowing for calculation of merit earned.

## The Primacy of Giving

* Giving is more psychologically satisfying than morality because its rewards are clear and explicit.
* Sermons and tales emphasize the benefits of generosity, aligning with Burmese aspirations for wealth, pleasure, and respect.
* Giving can be a mechanical act that doesn't require inwardness, making it accessible to everyone.

## From Nibbanic to Kammatic Buddhism

* The shift from nibbanic to kammatic Buddhism emphasizes external actions over internal transformation.
* Merit-seeking through giving aims to change one's social and material status rather than one's moral character.

## The Buddhist Initiation Ceremony

* This ceremony, while significant, focuses more on mechanically acquiring merit than fostering spiritual discipline.
* Sponsors often initiate boys multiple times for their own benefit, highlighting the external focus of contemporary Buddhism.
* Even seemingly altruistic acts like providing refreshments at a monk's funeral are motivated by the desire to accrue merit for the giver.

# The Moral Paradox in Merit Striving

*  The ritual of merit sharing and transfer can be motivated by self-interest or altruism.
* For those who believe merit can be shared, both the giver and receiver acquire merit.
* Giving paradoxically increases the giver's merit.

# Inwardness and Giving

* Burmese Buddhism emphasizes giving over inward morality as a means to acquire merit. 
* Pure intention (cetana) is crucial for merit acquisition through giving.
* Merit derived from dana depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, not the donor.

# Sacrifice as a Dominant Theme

* Sacrifice plays a significant role in Burmese culture and influences their emphasis on giving.
* Giving involves self-deprivation and constitutes genuine sacrifice for many Burmese.
* Dana becomes a more meaningful indicator of piety than moral conformity because it requires sacrifice.

# The Buddha as a Model of Self-Sacrifice

* The Vessantara Jataka, a story about the Buddha's past life, exemplifies extreme self-sacrifice.
* This story reinforces the belief in the religious efficacy of giving through sacrifice.
* Sacrifice is ultimately a means to soteriological ends.

# Prestige and Honor Associated with Giving

* Special giving earns respect and prestige in Burmese society.
* People are judged based on the amount they spend on dana.
* Public displays of generosity enhance social standing. 




## The Content Of Giving
* Dana primarily refers to religious giving in Burmese Buddhism.
* Religious acts like supporting monks, erecting pagodas, and offering flowers to Buddha images are considered dana.
* Acts of charity towards non-religious causes have less merit or are not considered dana at all.

## The Motivational Salience Of Merit
* Merit acquisition is a central concern for the Burmese due to its importance in their soteriology.
* Every action is viewed from the perspective of its potential merit.
* Compliance with Buddhist moral codes often stems from a desire to gain merit rather than purely ethical considerations.

## A Note On Children
* Children under nine years old generally do not understand the concept of merit.
* By age eleven, most children have some understanding of merit's significance.
* Children learn early on that monks are crucial for acquiring merit.

## Kammatic Buddhism: Iii. The Key Doctrine Of Karma
* Kammatic Buddhism focuses on enhancing good karma rather than extinguishing it for salvation within samsara.
* Karma is closely related to merit, but the relationship varies depending on whether viewed from a nibbanic or kammatic perspective.
* In canonical Buddhism, karma refers to volitional actions (good or bad) that produce corresponding consequences (merit/demerit and favorable/unfavorable retribution).

## Fig. 6

* Karma is conceived as the effect of merit or demerit.
* Good/bad actions produce merit/demerit respectively.
* Merit/demerit produces good/bad karma which leads to appropriate retribution.

## Fig. 7

* Actions (good/bad) lead to merit/demerit.
* Merit/demerit produces karma (good/bad).
* Karma results in retribution (pleasant/unpleasant).

* Burmese believe life fate is determined by one's karma, which is the consequence of past actions.
* Karma is a metaphysical force responsible for retribution.


##  

* The canonical and Burmese conceptions of karma differ lexically and conceptually.
* Canonical view: "karma" refers to any action with moral retribution.
* Burmese view: "karma" refers to the metaphysical force causing retribution.
* Both agree that destiny reflects retribution for meritorious/demeritorious actions, expressing the law of cause and effect (moral retribution).

##  

* Burmese sometimes view karma mechanically rather than morally.
* Examples include marriage, birthplace, or encounters being attributed to karma.

* Karma can also be used synonymously with luck, fortune, fate, or chance.
* "Bad karma" explains misfortune, while actions to improve karma aim to change luck.


##  

* Two logically possible interpretations of the relationship between karma, merit, and retribution exist in Burma.

* **First Interpretation:** Accumulated merit produces good karma (rewarding consequences), while accumulated demerit produces bad karma (painful consequences).
    * This interpretation has two variants:

        * **Variant 1:** Good/bad karma represent the sum of one's merits/demerits. Retribution is for aggregated acts, not individual ones. Each type of karma produces an aggregated retribution.

        * **Variant 2:** Each act (or type) produces separate, specific retribution ("wut"). Retribution is determined and specific to the act(s).
            * Wut for demerit is more specific; punishment fits the crime.
            * Examples: dacoits reborn as dacoit victims, debtors reborn as servants of creditors.

##  

* **Second Interpretation:** One karmic force represents the net balance of accumulated merit and demerit.
    * Good karma results from a larger merit accumulation, leading to pleasurable retribution.
    * Bad karma results from a larger demerit accumulation, leading to painful retribution.
* Karma is always in flux, changing with the accumulation of merit or demerit.



## # Karma As A Net Balance Of Merit And Demerit

* This conception of karma allows for change based on the accumulation of merit and demerit.
* It forms the basis for practices in Buddhism aimed at altering one's karma.
* It can lead to a combination of immoral and pious actions, as individuals attempt to balance their karmic ledger.
* The transfer of merit, especially at death, is believed to influence rebirth based on this conception.

## # Psychological Press And The Neutralization Of Karma

* The first conception of karma emphasizes the inevitability of retribution for evil deeds, regardless of subsequent good actions.
* This view places a heavy moral and emotional burden on individuals, making Buddhism particularly demanding.
* The second conception offers an escape from this harshness by allowing for the neutralization of demerit through merit.

* While demerit is not erased or forgiven, it can be counterbalanced by sufficient merit, leading to positive karmic consequences.
* This interpretation provides hope and a sense of agency in shaping one's destiny.

* In Burma, the desire to avoid hell motivates belief in the neutralization of demerit.


* Monks often hold differing views on the extent to which demerit can be neutralized. Some believe only meditation can achieve this, while others maintain that persistent evil-doing cannot be counteracted by merit.
* Both conceptions of karma are widely accepted in Burma, with individuals choosing which interpretation to apply based on their specific circumstances.



## Merit Transfer And Karma

* The doctrine of karma emphasizes individual responsibility for salvation.
* Canonical Buddhism acknowledges the harshness of this doctrine and allows for practices like merit sharing and transfer to soften its impact.

## Sharing and Transferring Merit

* Following meritorious acts, Buddhists often share their accumulated merit with others through prayers and rituals.
* This practice raises questions about how merit can be shared when karmic retribution is believed to be solely based on individual actions.

## Reconciling Merit Transfer with Karma

* Some Burmese monks acknowledge the contradiction between merit transfer and the immutability of karma, reinterpreting these rituals as acts of spiritual discipline that benefit both giver and receiver through their intentions.
* Others believe that witnessing or hearing about meritorious acts allows recipients to acquire merit through their own mental state.

## Psychological Necessity and Historical Context

* The prevalence of merit sharing suggests a psychological need for hope and relief from the strict consequences of karma.
* This practice has historical roots in early Buddhism, appearing in scriptures and commentaries as early as the second century A.D. 
* In Burma, it is deeply ingrained in Buddhist tradition, with evidence dating back to the reign of King Anawrahta.

## The Dynamics Of Belief In Karma Salvation And Karma

* The doctrines of merit and karma are central to kammatic Buddhism, providing a solution to the problem of suffering and offering a path to salvation.

* While the karmic doctrine can explain present circumstances based on past actions, Buddhists primarily believe in it because it promises to influence future rebirths through present actions.
* The desire to alleviate suffering, rather than simply understanding its meaning, motivates the belief in karma. 
* Burmese Buddhists sometimes challenge karmic explanations for suffering and have modified the doctrine to allow for neutralization of demerit and sharing of merit.

## Karma Salvation And Rebirth

* The belief in rebirth is essential for salvation because it allows individuals to accumulate enough merit over multiple lifetimes to achieve enlightenment.
* While rebirth can lead to desirable or undesirable realms, the possibility of controlling one's future rebirths through actions provides hope.

* The Burmese find compelling evidence for karma and rebirth in the perceived inequities of life and anecdotal accounts of reincarnation.

## Evidence For Karma And Rebirth

* Anomalies, such as unusual births or foreigners choosing to live in Burma, are interpreted as evidence of past lives.
* Numerous cases of individuals claiming to remember past lives and providing specific details about them further support the belief in rebirth.


## Cognitive Consistency and Religious Doctrine

* The Burmese acceptance of kammatic Buddhism can be explained by both their desire for salvation and the compatibility of the merit-karma-rebirth doctrine with their cognitive structure.
* Alternative paths to salvation, such as reliance on a divine savior, are inconsistent with Burmese perceptual and cognitive frameworks.

# The Absence of Savior Gods in Burma

* Burmese Buddhism lacks the Mahayanist belief in savior gods despite historical exposure to Mahayanism.
* Burmese believe supernatural protection can be obtained for this life, but not for future lives.
* Assistance from protective agents (devas) is earned through spells and meritorious acts, not compassion.

# The Sole Reliance on Karma

* Burmese believe salvation must be achieved through individual effort (meditation or merit).
* Even those who believe the Buddha is alive deny divine intervention in salvation.
* Emphasis on karma as the sole soteriological agent reflects a belief that individuals are solely responsible for their salvation.

# Cognitive Structure and Soteriology

* The Burmese cognitive structure, shaped by socialization patterns, may explain their lack of belief in savior gods.
* Early childhood experiences of indulgent nurturance followed by withdrawal may create a sense of self-reliance.
* This experience contrasts with the need for parental love and emotional support often associated with belief in divine saviors.

# The Influence of Infancy on Belief

* Burmese socialization, characterized by initial indulgence followed by withdrawal of nurturance, may contribute to their belief that salvation comes from individual effort.
* Early experiences of having needs met through crying or gestures might lead to the belief that one's actions can bring about desired outcomes (karma).

# Feeding Monks and Infantile Bliss

* The Burmese practice of feeding monks as a way to create good karma may be linked to infantile experiences.
* Infancy, a period of complete gratification, becomes a symbolic model for salvation.
* Feeding monks, seen as symbolic infants, might evoke the unconscious desire to recreate the bliss of infantile satiety.





## Theodicy And Karma

* **Theodicy And Karma**
    *  In Buddhism, karma is used to explain the problem of suffering. 
    * The doctrine of karma provides a solution to three cognitive problems related to suffering: why it exists, its unequal distribution, and its seemingly inequitable distribution.

* **Karma as a Solution to Suffering**
    * Karma explains various forms of suffering, including gambling losses, accidents, illness, droughts, and premature death.
    * While natural causation is acknowledged, karma is seen as the ultimate explanation for why suffering occurs to specific individuals.

* **The Paradox of Karma**
    * Although karma provides a seemingly complete solution to the problem of suffering, it also creates anxiety due to uncertainty about one's karmic balance and future rebirths.
    * The deterministic nature of karma means that even a meritorious life doesn't guarantee happiness in the next rebirth.

* **Uncertainty and Hope**
    * The uncertainty surrounding karmic balance can be both positive and negative.
    * While it creates anxiety for the fortunate, it offers hope to the unfortunate who believe they may experience good fortune in the future due to past merit.

* **Cognitive Basis of Karma**
    * Burmese socialization experiences, characterized by unpredictability and parental inconsistency, contribute to the acceptance of karma.
    * The expectation of uncertainty and belief in personal responsibility, developed during childhood, align with the karmic explanation for misfortune and fortune.

## Childhood Experience And Religious Belief

* The theory proposes that childhood experiences shape cognitive sets and need dispositions, influencing religious beliefs.
* It predicts a range of structurally equivalent beliefs rather than specific doctrines because cognitive sets are broad orientations, not concrete beliefs.
* Burmese belief in karma is an example: their childhood experience predisposes them to believe in self-responsibility for salvation, which aligns with karma but could also apply to other similar doctrines.

## Apotropaic Buddhism: A Religion Of Magical Protection

* Apotropaic Buddhism differs from soteriological Buddhism by focusing on mundane concerns like health, prosperity, and protection from harm.
* It utilizes magical acts and appeals to supernatural beings for achieving these goals, unlike the self-effort emphasized in soteriological Buddhism.
* Burmese view the world as inherently dangerous, and Buddhism serves as a protective shield against these dangers through rituals, ethics, and scriptures. 




## Psychological Press And The Reinterpretation Ooo Normative Doctrine

* Suffering and deliverance from suffering are central to soteriological Buddhism, but it doesn't address all human pain due to its limited conception of the problem, otherworldly solution, and karmic causality leaving little room for escaping present pain.

* The classical doctrine of suffering in the Four Noble Truths is more hortatory than descriptive, focusing on making people see that suffering exists even when it appears not to, emphasizing its inevitability in sentient experience.
* Soteriological Buddhism doesn't provide respite from immediate stress like physical pain, frustration, or illness because it focuses on uprooting the cause of suffering (attachment and rebirth) rather than treating symptoms.

* This approach appeals to a sated social stratum but not to the masses who experience pain as a consequence of frustrated desire and seek blissful future rebirths.
* Kammatic Buddhism doesn't address other forms of stress like natural disasters or attacks by evil spirits, which are not caused by desire and require immediate solutions.

## 'The Following Quotation Is Typical Of The Genre.

* Theravada Buddhism includes nonsoteriological goals within its domain due to the psychological need for protection against pain and danger.
* This led to the development of apotropaic Buddhism, which incorporates rituals like recitation of spells, worship of images, and performance of rites.

* Apotropaic Buddhism is legitimate because it rests on a scriptural foundation, with the paritta ritual serving as its central core.
* Although some argue that Theravada Buddhism is free of magic, the use of paritta, prescribed by Scripture and attributed to the Buddha, demonstrates otherwise. 




## The Canonical Basis For Apotropaic Buddhism

* Paritta are spells from Buddhist scriptures chanted for protection against danger.
* Some paritta were composed by the Buddha himself, while others have been used as spells since early Theravada Buddhism.

## The Khanda Paritta

* This spell was allegedly composed by the Buddha to protect monks from snakes.
* It is based on the idea that love and compassion can ward off danger.

## The Mora (Peacock) Paritta

* This paritta comes from a Jataka tale about a peacock who was protected from harm by reciting spells.
* The story illustrates how even holy beings can be tempted, and the importance of mindfulness and recitation.

## The Dhajagga (Top of the Banner) Paritta

* Based on a Buddha's teaching about overcoming fear by thinking of him or the Dharma.
* It emphasizes the Buddha's enlightenment and lack of fear compared to lesser deities.

## The Atanatiya Paritta

* This paritta was given by the Buddha to protect his followers from demons.
* It highlights the importance of faith and refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

## The Angulimala (Garland of Fingers) Paritta

* Named after a reformed robber who became a monk.
* This paritta emphasizes truthfulness and its power to protect.

## The Ratana (Jewel) Paritta

* Taught by the Buddha to Ananda to rid Vesali of calamities caused by evil spirits.
* It involves reciting a hymn praising the Three Jewels while sprinkling water.

## The Vattaka (Quail) Paritta

* Based on a Jataka tale about a quail who saved himself and others from fire through an "act of truth."
* This paritta emphasizes faith and the power of remembering past Buddhas.





## The "Theological" Basis For Apotropaic Buddhism The Power Of Buddhist Sacra

* Scripture does not explain how paritta works or how it reconciles with karma.
* Burmese Buddhists often don't question how paritta works, focusing on its efficacy.
* This raises questions about the ontological basis for protection rituals in Buddhism.

##  The Efficacy of Protection Rituals

* While nirvana and rebirth are explained by the destruction of karma and merit acquisition respectively, the basis for protection ritual efficacy is unclear.
* There are differing opinions on whether the Buddha actively protects devotees or if His power passively radiates.

## The Role of the Buddha in Protection

* Some believe the Buddha is alive and can intervene directly, while others view Him as dead but radiating magical power through His virtues and relics.
* Less educated villagers may be more likely to believe the Buddha is alive.
* Even those who believe the Buddha is dead often attribute protection to His power, accessed through faith, Virtues, or words.

## Other Sources of Power

* Some rituals rely on the power inherent in Buddha images, relics, or specific locations.
* The efficacy of verbal spells like the Ratana Sutta is attributed to both the power of the Buddha's words and the psychic power generated in the reciter.

## Thirteen Sources of Power

* Monks identify thirteen sources of protection, including the Buddha, Teaching, Order, Silent Buddhas, parents, teachers, and various deities.
* The power of the samma deva (Buddhist gods) is particularly important, protecting those who have faith in the Three Gems and live morally.




# The Efficacy of Buddhist Protection Rituals in Burma

* Different informants give different reasons for the assistance of gods during rituals: faith in them, merit acquired by the performance, or piety.
* All agree that if the actor is pious and moral, divine assistance is compulsory.

# Merit and Instant Karma

* Some believe that rituals create merit which immediately changes karmic balance, averting danger.
* This belief in "instant karma" was demonstrated by the construction of sand pagodas to avert an astrologically predicted disaster.

# Lay vs. Monastic Explanations

* Laymen hold all three explanations simultaneously, while monks are more skeptical of ritual efficacy except for paritta (scripturally based chants).

# Monks' Views on Buddha and Deva Assistance

* Monks believe the Buddha is dead and cannot help directly, but worship enhances karma which may produce desired consequences.
* They believe deva can assist pious Buddhists, citing Jataka tales as proof.

# A Psychological Interpretation

* The Burmese conception of apotropaic Buddhism is confused due to inconsistent parental care in childhood.
* This leads to vague expectations concerning supernatural assistance and a tendency to coerce supernatural power rather than propitiate beings.
* The image of deva remains vague, reflecting the lack of clear differentiation between gods.

## The Problem Of Karma

* Burmese beliefs challenge the doctrine of karma through apotropaic Buddhism.
* Cultural challenge: Burmese accept non-karmic causes for suffering like witches, evil spirits, and astrological influences.
* Psychological challenge: Reluctance to accept karmic determinism leads to performing rituals to avert karmically caused events.

## Apotropaic Rituals and Karmic Doctrine

* Burmese deal with the contradiction between karma and non-karmic beliefs in various ways: ignoring it, feeling distressed by it, rejecting non-Buddhist beliefs, or reconciling them through a karmic interpretation.
* Some interpret non-karmic events as signs of impending danger caused by karma.
* Others believe evil spirits are agents of karma, harming only those with "bad" karma.

## Reconciling Apotropaic Rituals with Karma

* Burmese attempt to harmonize apotropaic rituals with karmic doctrine.
* Rituals are seen as effective only for pious Buddhists whose karma doesn't predetermine negative outcomes.
* Some believe rituals can prevent karmic retribution by altering one's karmic balance through acts of merit.

## Legitimizing Non-Buddhist Rites

* Even non-Buddhist rites are interpreted in a karmic mode to justify their practice.
* Example: A monk explained a snake-averting ritual as an act of dana that changed the villager's karmic balance, preventing misfortune.




## # The Karmic Interpretation of Apotropaic Ritual

* One should not solely rely on past karma for protection.
* Wisdom and effort are crucial, as exemplified by seeking refuge in a pagoda during a snake bite.
* Merit gained through ritual can be beneficial even if it doesn't directly counteract bad karma.
* In borderline cases, increased merit from rituals might tip the karmic balance towards recovery.

## # Religion, Magic, And Buddhism

* Apotropaic Buddhism is not separate from "religious" Buddhism but an integral part of its history and civilization.
* Canonical Buddhism acknowledges apotropaic ritual and its ontological basis.
* While monks are discouraged from boasting about magical abilities due to the emphasis on salvation, magic itself is not condemned.

## # Apotropaic Buddhism in Buddhist Civilization

* Apotropaic Buddhism has deep historical roots and plays a significant role in Buddhist cultures.
* It's as important today as it was in ancient times, integrated with kammatic and nibbanic Buddhism.
* The efficacy of Buddhist magic is attributed to the power of Buddhist sacra and the assistance of deva (gods).

## # Theistic Aspects of Buddhism

* While the Buddha might not be considered a god in the traditional sense, Buddhists believe in benevolent and malevolent superhuman beings.
* These gods play a crucial role in apotropaic Buddhism, protecting believers from harm caused by evil spirits.
* Defining Buddhism as atheistic or anti-magical is inaccurate, as it acknowledges both gods and magic within its framework.

## # Esoteric Buddhism: A Religion Of Chiliastic Expectations 




## The Major Features Of Esoteric Buddhism

* Burmese Buddhism has two esoteric systems distinct from its exoteric forms.
* These esoteric systems are soteriological, aiming for salvation but differ significantly from normative Buddhist doctrines.
* They are syncretic, blending occult beliefs (Indian, Chinese, and indigenous) with Buddhist doctrines for legitimacy.
* Esoteric Buddhism is institutionalized in quasi-secret sects accessible only through initiation.

## The Quest for Imminent Salvation

* Unlike exoteric Buddhism which focuses on future salvation, esoteric sects seek immediate or different forms of salvation in the present existence.
* This reflects a common desire across religions to achieve salvation without deferring it to a future life.
* Esoteric sects in Burmese Buddhism add another soteriological system alongside traditional Buddhist beliefs.

## Weikza and Chiliastic Orientation

* Both major esoteric systems believe in weikza, mythical magicians with supernatural powers who have overcome death and serve as the sect's spiritual master.
* One system aims for adepts to become weikza themselves, while the other emphasizes the founding master weikza.
* These beliefs are integrated with Buddhist concepts like the Future Buddha and Universal Emperor, creating a chiliastic orientation.

## Two Major Esoteric Ideologies

* "Millennial Buddhism" combines the belief in the founding master weikza with the utopian belief in the Future King of Burma.
* "Eschatological Buddhism" combines the aspiration to become weikza oneself with the belief in the Future Buddha. 




## Eschatological Buddhism Alchemy And Its Goals

* Burmese alchemical techniques are similar to but distinct from European alchemy, likely influenced by Chinese and Indian practices.
* The primary goals of Burmese alchemy include achieving magical power and immortality through the creation of an alchemic stone (datloung).

## Burmese Alchemical Theory

* Burmese alchemy is based on the belief that all matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water.
* An eternal essence underlies these elements, contradicting Buddhist doctrine of impermanence.
* Extracting this essence from metals like mercury and iron and injecting it into a human can grant them immortality.

## Stages of Alchemic Stone Development

* A partially refined alchemic stone possesses magical powers, such as preserving freshness, granting speed, and protecting against fire or venomous snakes.
* A fully purified stone grants its possessor extraordinary abilities: flight, invisibility, teleportation, instant gratification, and eternal life.

## The Weikza

* By swallowing the perfected alchemic stone during a dangerous initiation ceremony, an alchemist becomes a weikza.
* Weikzas possess superhuman powers and achieve eternal youth and immortality.
* They withdraw from human society, finding refuge in remote Himalayan regions and abstaining from meat consumption.

## Origin Story of Alchemy and Weikzahood

* Burmese villagers believe alchemy originated in Pagan with a hermit who sought to become a weikza through his alchemic stone.
* After the king, who funded his experiments, blinded him for depleting the treasury, the hermit discovered that human excrement was the missing ingredient for his stone's completion.
* He regained his sight using animal eyes and the stone, then turned all metals into gold before retiring to become a weikza. 




## Alchemic Sects

* Only eight laymen in Yeigyi practice alchemy, while two of four village monks do. 
* The high cost of alchemy, including feeding the alchemic stone with gold, limits participation.
* Many Burmese practice alchemy and belong to esoteric sects (gaing:) despite Buddhist doctrines.

## Weikzahood and Buddhism

* Alchemic sects aim for weikza, a state of prolonged life and superhuman powers.
* Despite its occult nature, weikzahood is adapted to Buddhist principles by limiting the duration of extended life and connecting it to the belief in the Future Buddha Maitreya.
* The Future Buddha's arrival is believed to usher in a new world where pious individuals will survive and achieve nirvana through worshiping the Buddha Gautama's physical body.

## Justifications for Weikzahood

* Sect members justify their pursuit of weikza by claiming that it allows them to live long enough to witness Maitreya's arrival and attain nirvana through his worship.
* Some argue that Buddhism doesn't solely teach suffering, but also acknowledges pleasure, and weikzahood represents a life free from pain.

## Buddhist Practices within Sects

* Initiation into alchemic sects requires commitment to Buddhist discipline, including moral precepts, devotions, and meditation.
* Members seek protection from Buddhist gods or devas.

## The Path to Weikzahood

* Achieving weikzahood involves refining an alchemic stone capable of granting superhuman powers.
* The alchemist must swallow the stone and be buried alive for seven days while a disciple faces various tests to protect him.
* Success results in the alchemist emerging as a full-fledged weikza.

## Exorcism and Alchemists

* Many sect members, though not achieving weikzahood, develop other powers, including controlling supernatural beings.
* Some use these powers for good, acting as exorcists (ahte:lan: hsaya) who expel evil spirits and witches.
* Exorcists often rely on their membership in esoteric sects and the power of their sect's master weikza during ceremonies.

## The Connection Between Alchemy and Exorcism

* Apotropaic Buddhism intersects with esoteric Buddhism through the role of exorcists.
* Exorcists learn their craft within esoteric sects and often invoke the assistance of their sect's master weikza during exorcisms.
* Exorcism provides alchemists, who are often not wealthy, with the financial resources to continue their experiments.

## Millennial Buddhism The Idea Of The Future King

* **The Buddhist notion of a Universal Emperor (Cakkavatti)** and the utopian age which he will usher in has a long history in Burma, influencing politics and socialist aspirations. Burmese kings claimed rights to conquer foreign lands or recognition as Embryo Buddhas based on this belief.
* **In normative Buddhism**, there is a connection between a Buddha and a Universal Emperor. Both possess the thirty-two marks of the superman and can choose to become either a Buddha or a Cakkavatti (Turner of the Wheel).

* **Distinct from the Buddhist belief in the Universal Emperor, but later merging with it, is the Burmese belief in the Future King.** This hope for restoration of the monarchy arose after British conquest. 
* **Millennial Buddhism** combines Buddhist notions of a Universal Emperor and a Future Buddha with Burmese beliefs about a Future King, weikzahood (magical powers), and occult power. Peasant revolts during British rule were inspired by these beliefs, fueled by hopes of abolishing foreign rule and restoring the traditional Buddhist monarchy.

* **In post-Independence Burma**, belief in a Future King persists, particularly among peasants. While some Burmese monks are skeptical, many lay people believe this king will restore law and order, drive out foreigners, and usher in a utopian society.
* **Unlike the Future Buddha**, who is expected to appear much later, the Future King is believed to arrive anytime within the second half of the present Buddha's dispensation.

* **Millennial Buddhism as part of esoteric Buddhism** adds two features: the belief that the Future King or his herald is already here and membership in an esoteric sect devoted to him. These sects often incorporate eschatological elements, believing the Future King to be a weikza (a person with magical powers) and an incarnation of past master weikzas.




## Two Future Kings

* The text discusses two individuals claiming to be the future king of Burma. 
* Both men are associated with messianic Buddhist sects, which are rare in Burma.

## Bodaw Setkya

* Lives in a "palace" in Mandalay and is referred to as Bodaw Setkya by his followers.
* Claims to be a powerful exorcist and master of Buddhist meditation.
* Denies being the Future King but implies he has achieved nirvana or Buddhahood.
* Practices occult medicine and alchemy, attracting many followers.

## Bo Min Gaung

* A weikza (a supernatural being) who is believed to be the reincarnation of Bo Min Gaung.
* Lives in a house in Mandalay and receives visitors seeking advice.
* Claims that the spirit of Bo Min Gaung resides within him.
* Avoids directly answering questions about being a Future Buddha or King.




# The Weikza Ba Pwa

* A man named Ba Pwa is believed to be possessed by the spirit of Bo Min Gaung, a powerful weikza.
* Bo Min Gaung first appeared to Ba Pwa in physical form and has since possessed him daily.
* Bo Min Gaung instructs Ba Pwa to live with love, concentration, and help people follow Buddhist precepts.

# The Nature of the Possession

* Ba Pwa is seen as both an individual and a vessel for Bo Min Gaung's spirit.
* Bo Min Gaung chose to remain in the world as a weikza to help others instead of becoming a Buddha or entering nirvana.
* Bo Min Gaung is considered both an Embryo Buddha and a weikza, possessing immortality.

# Ba Pwa's Life and Followers

* Ba Pwa was a mill-owner before his possession by Bo Min Gaung.
* He renounced worldly possessions and now lives on alms and donations from followers.
* Ba Pwa has many followers, including university graduates, who recognize his power.

# The Rivalry with Bodaw Setkya

* Ba Pwa's follower views Bodaw Setkya as a competitor to Ba Pwa.
* He predicts "strange things" will occur within the year, suggesting a power struggle.
* Neither Bo Min Gaung nor Bodaw Setkya is believed to be the Future King.

# Ba Pwa as the Future King

* Ba Pwa's follower admits that Ba Pwa is seen as the Future King.
* He predicts that Bo Min Gaung (or possibly Ba Pwa) will show his power in a year or two, leading everyone to worship him.
* This includes the current government, even Premier U Nu, who will bow down before him. 




## Motives And Functions Of Belief

* Although esoteric sects have a small membership, their beliefs are common among Burmese people.
* Belief in weikza and the Future King is found across social classes, including educated and westernized individuals. 
* Many educated Burmese, including government officials, professors, and businessmen, practice alchemy.

## What Is Most Remarkable

* The intensity of belief in esoteric phenomena among educated Burmese is striking.
* They invest significant time and wealth in alchemic experiments, often losing fortunes in the process.

## U Tein's Involvement

* A government official named U Tein takes immense pride in his alchemic stones.
* He engaged in lengthy discussions with other alchemists about their stones and their powers.
* During a headman election, U Tein prioritized discussing alchemy with local experts over his administrative duties.

## Explanations for Involvement

* The desire for immortality and eternal youth is a universal human dream, appealing to the Burmese.
* Achieving superhuman powers through alchemy appeals to the desire for power and autonomy, which is strong in Burmese culture.

## Weikzahood's Appeal

* For lower social strata, weikzahood offers compensation for their lack of power and autonomy.
* For upper-class Burmese, it provides a latent function by addressing narcissistic wounds caused by colonialism and post-independence failures.




## Esoteric Buddhism And Burmese Religion

* Alchemy is used by educated Burmese as a way to achieve the goals of science and technology without adopting Western methods. 
* This belief stems from Burma's desire for progress while remaining distinct from the West.

* The hope for a Future King reflects universal human aspirations for a leader who embodies goodness, power, and authority.
* This hope is intensified in Burma due to its historical experience of leaders lacking these qualities.
* The Future King represents a utopian ideal, activated by the political crisis following Burmese independence.

## Esoteric Buddhism And Burmese Religion

* Esoteric Buddhism incorporates elements of nat (spirit) worship, making it difficult to separate from traditional Burmese religion.
* While some scholars argue for a syncretistic view of Burmese religion, the author proposes that Buddhism and animism exist side by side but are distinct entities.

* The author argues against viewing esoteric Buddhism as representative of all Burmese Buddhists, as most Burmese do not belong to esoteric sects.

* Although most Burmese participate in both Buddhist and nat practices, these are compartmentalized, with Buddhism holding a position of primacy.

## The Buddhist Cultus: Its General Attributes




## A Typology Of Ritual Action

* Although *Mahāyāna* Buddhism is known for its complex rituals, *Therāvada* Buddhism also has a rich ritual system.
* This system includes instrumental, commemorative, and expressive rituals.
* Instrumental rituals aim to achieve specific goals, either extrinsic (like health or wealth) or intrinsic (like spiritual change).
* Commemorative rituals celebrate events in the life of religious figures.
* Expressive rituals express emotions and sentiments towards religious objects.

## Ritual Types And Buddhist Ideological Types

* Nibbanic Buddhism primarily emphasizes expressive and commemorative rituals.
* Offerings to the Buddha are seen as expressions of veneration, not as means for attaining nirvana.
* The Confession of Faith is considered the most important ritual in nibbanic Buddhism.
* Some Buddhists believe that worshiping relics can lead to a better rebirth, but this view is not universally accepted.
* While some Burmese monks see Buddhist worship primarily as a way to purify the mind, others believe it can also bring worldly benefits.

# The Mahavastu and Milinda on the Rewards of Pagoda Worship

* The Mahavastu emphasizes the inexhaustible merit of the Buddha and promises vast rewards for offerings made to him, including wealth, splendor, kingship, and heavenly rebirth. 
* These rewards are described in great detail and require twenty-five pages to list.
* The Milinda text, while acknowledging the Buddha's passing, argues that constructing a pagoda still yields important fruits.

* It suggests that paying homage to the relics of the Buddha, even though he no longer accepts gifts, leads to spiritual growth and attainment. 
* Both texts emphasize the psychological benefits of worship rather than focusing solely on merit derived from offerings.

# Contemporary Burmese Beliefs on Buddhist Worship

* Burmese Buddhists believe in both the instrumental and expressive value of worship.
* They see it as enhancing chances for a better rebirth through offerings and cultivating a good mental state conducive to favorable rebirth.

# Apotropaic Buddhism

* This type of Buddhism focuses on ritual as a means of protection in this life, contrasting with kammatic Buddhism's emphasis on enhanced rebirth.

# A Note On Children

* Burmese children universally practice worshiping the Buddha, primarily for gaining merit.
* They also pray to the Buddha for specific goals like material possessions, safety, and health. 
* As children mature, their understanding of Buddhist worship and prayer evolves, aligning with adult norms by age twelve.

## The Forms Of Buddhist Ritual Action

* **Offerings:**
    * Almost all Buddhist rituals involve offerings like candles, flowers, water, and food.
    * Motives for offering vary: soteriological (achieving nirvana, better rebirth), commemorative (remembering the Buddha), duty/custom, psychological comfort.
    * Offerings are not believed to be desired by or useful to the Buddha, but rather increase merit for the worshiper.
    * A standard prayer is recited when making offerings.
    * Kadaw pwe, a special offering of bananas and coconut, is made during festivals.

* **Motor Behavior:**
    * Physical prostration (shi.khou) is a fundamental part of Buddhist worship, involving kneeling and touching the forehead to the floor three times.
    * Prostration is shown to the Buddha image, pagoda, and other objects worthy of reverence like teachers and parents.
    * Other motor behaviors include removing shoes before entering sacred spaces, sitting or resting on haunches in the presence of sacred objects, and specific hand positions during litanies.

* **Verbal Behavior:**
    * "Verbal behavior" encompasses prayers, petitions, devotions, spells, and incantations.
    * Hsu.taung refers to requesting a boon, but in Buddhist thought, rewards are earned through deeds, not granted as favors.
    * Prayers often express the hope that offerings will lead to desired outcomes as consequences of merit accumulated. 




## Objects Of Ritual Veneration

* Pagodas are sacred structures in Buddhism, serving as relic chambers and symbols of the Buddha. 
* They are typically triangular or cylindrical, made of stone or brick, and found throughout Burma.
* Pagodas have symbolic interpretations, representing Mount Meru, the three worlds, and nirvana.
* Guardian figures like leogryphs, ogres, and winged creatures protect pagodas.

* True pagodas contain relics of the Buddha or other holy figures, buried deep inside and inaccessible to the public.
* The presence of a relic makes the pagoda an embodiment of the Buddha, attracting worship and reverence.
* Many pagodas are built for merit and prestige, even if they don't house relics.

* Buddhists also worship visible relics like the sacred tooth, found in Ceylon and China.
* Symbolic representations of the Buddha, such as the lotus, Wheel, and bo tree, are also objects of devotion.
* The most prevalent symbol is the Buddha image, found in various forms (seated, standing, reclining) and sizes.

* Buddha images require consecration through recitation of verses from the Dhammapada and painting of the eyes to become ritually sacred.
* Relics and images of famous monks and saints are also venerated, with offerings made to them.

# A Cultic Typology And A Classification Of The Buddhist Cultus

* Ritual purpose is not useful for classifying a religious cultus due to overlapping and ambiguous classes.
* A typology based on the dimension of occurrence allows for unambiguous classification from a cultural perspective.

# The Ceremonial Cycle: I. Calendrical Rituals

* Many Buddhist ceremonies and festivals are tied to the lunar calendar, making them cyclical and predictable.
* The Buddhist ceremonial cycle consists of daily, weekly (and biweekly), monthly, and annual cycles.
* Participation in these ceremonies is voluntary, and failure to participate is not considered sinful.
* Almost all adult Buddhists participate in some way in every type of ceremony at various social levels. 




## The Daily Cycle

* The day begins and ends with devotions performed in front of a small shrine found in almost every Burmese household.
* The shrine typically contains a vase for flowers to honor the Buddha, and may also include an image or picture of the Buddha.
* Devotions consist of reciting the Okasa (Burmese, o-ka-tha), the Buddhist Common Prayer, and the Five Precepts.

## Public Devotions

* Every evening after sunset, public devotions are held in the village chapel.
* Attendance is typically sparse, consisting mainly of older men, women, and teenage girls.
* The service is congregational, with a fixed service taken from a popular prayer book.
* Unlike pagoda worship, which is private, chapel worship is led by male elders.

## Chapel Service Components

* **Invocation of the gods (nat pin:)**: Requesting the Buddhist gods to hear the prayers and participate in the ceremony.
* **Invocation of the presence of the Buddha (nei-ya-daw hkin:)**: Requesting the Buddha to descend to a "throne" prepared for him so that he may be worshipped.
* **Permission to worship the Buddha (hpaya: pin.):** Asking permission from the Buddha to worship him.
* **Prayer (hsu.taung: gan):** Praying for nirvana and the higher abodes as a result of worshipping the Buddha.
* **Request of the precepts (thi-la. taung:):** Requesting the Buddha to offer the Five Precepts so that worshippers may attain nirvana.
* **Prayer (hsu.taung:):** Praying for understanding of "suffering," "nonself," and "impermanence" to attain supermundane powers and nirvana.
* **Offering of flowers, candles, and water:** Offering these items with words expressing cleansing, drink, and fulfillment of the Buddha's desires.
* **Recitation of the Five Objects of worship (ananda nga:ba:):** Giving veneration to the Buddha, the Law, the Order, parents, and teachers.
* **Recitation of two paritta-the Mangala Sutta and the Metta Suttain Burmese translation:** Reciting these suttas for protection from evil creatures.
* **The dissemination of love (myitta pou.de):** Praying for all beings to be free from enmity, care, oppression, and adversity, and to enjoy prosperity.

* **Recitation of the doctrine of Dependent Origination (Pali, Paticcasamuppada; Burmese, Pateiksa-thamoukpa):** Reciting the Buddha's analysis of the ontological basis for being and becoming.
* **Recitation of the "last words" of the Buddha (known in Burmese as patan chan):** Reciting the Buddha's famous line about decay being inherent in all things and urging diligence in working out salvation.

* **Recitation of the five khandha:** Reciting the five "heaps" into which human individuality is analyzed by Buddhism for protection from the Buddhist gods.
* **A prayer to the eight planets for protection from evil:** Praying to the eight Buddhas of the eight points of the compass.
* **Confession of Faith (hsu.taung: imaya damanu):** Taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.

* **Recitation of the life of the Buddha and of the Buddhist church in a Burmese folk version (tha-thana shauk).**
* **Water libation rite (yei-zetcha.):** Pouring water drop by drop while reciting a prayer for merit to be witnessed by deva and Withou-daya, an earth goddess.





## Release of the deva (nat pou.de):

* The gods who have worshiped with us may now return. 
* They are thanked for their presence and asked to return to their heavenly abodes.

## Sharing of merit (amhya. wei):

* Two girls proclaim that they share the merit with parents, friends, relatives, spirits, and all sentient beings.
* A large gong is sounded so that its vibrations spread to announce the merit performed.


## The Weekly And Monthly Cycles

* Burmese year is solar, but month is lunar.
* Four days in each lunar month are duty days or Sabbath days: full moon, new moon, and eighth day after each.
* These days were appropriated by Buddhism from pre-Buddhist India.
* Sabbath observers arrive at the monastic compound early in the morning and spend most of the day there.

* They offer alms food to monks and join other laymen for their own meal.
* Following their meal, they enter the monastery for rituals: chanting the Common Prayer, Buddhist Confession, and Ten Precepts.
* The rest of the day is spent quietly in the compound, observing the precepts. 
* Some discuss doctrine with monks, others pray or read Buddhist homilies.

* Sabbath observance is optional in Buddhism.
* Only the very pious, aged, or those free from economic obligations regularly observe it.
* Most villagers observe the Sabbath on major Buddhist holydays.

* The Sabbath day is an opportunity for laymen to live according to the Rule of the Buddha.
* It involves observing not only the five lay precepts but also the additional five precepts observed by monks.

* Although the monk alone lives according to the complete Buddhist Rule, the layman who observes the Five Precepts also lives under the Rule of the Buddha.
* Sabbath observance is primarily motivated by the desire for merit.

* Vowing to observe the precepts is crucial for acquiring merit.
* Unintentional violation does not produce demerit, and unintentional observance does not produce merit.

* Half the monks in a sample deemed the vow unimportant, while the other half stressed its importance as a source of merit and a psychologically impressive act conducive to observing the precepts.

* Sabbath observance is related to age, sex, and economic status:
    * Elderly people observe it more frequently than younger people.
    * Females observe it more often than males.
    * Poor people observe it more often than wealthy people.





## The Annual Cycle Introduction

* Buddhist holydays always fall on a Sabbath day and commemorate events in the life of Buddha.
* They often coincide with full or dark moons and likely originated from older religions, aligning with agricultural or climatic transitions.
* Many retain non-Buddhist elements, suggesting origins in nature or spirit cults.
* Even if non-Buddhist in origin, they are legitimized by Buddhist myths.

## The New Year

* Burmese New Year (Thingyan) falls in April and lasts three to four days, blending religious piety with festivities.
* It involves a Water Festival where people offer water to elders and playfully douse each other, symbolizing cleansing from the past year.
* Urban celebrations are more boisterous, involving insults, transvestism, and rowdy behavior.
* The third day marks the New Year proper, with people engaging in meritorious activities like worshipping at pagodas, observing precepts, offering to monks, and freeing animals.

## B Buddha Day

* Celebrated on the full moon of May (Kahsoung), it commemorates the birth, Enlightenment, and death of Gautama Buddha.
* Observances include watering the bo tree and releasing fish captured in drying water bodies.
* Despite its significance, Buddha Day is not a widely celebrated festival in Burma, possibly due to coinciding with the start of the agricultural season.

## Lent And The Inception Of Lent

* The three-month period from July to October is known as Buddhist Lent (Wa-zou). 
* During this time, monks cannot travel, marriages are prohibited, entertainment is forbidden, and Buddhists observe the Sabbath frequently.
* Wa-zou marks the beginning of both Lent and two seasons: rice production and monsoon.

## The Celebration Of Wa-zou

* Wa-zou is celebrated by the entire village as a sacred Buddhist congregation.
* Various task groups are formed to prepare food, collect offerings for monks, organize the village orchestra, etc.
* On Wa-zou eve, a procession with the village orchestra carries offerings to the resthouse adjacent to the monastery.

## The Ceremony

* Families arrive at the resthouse on Wa-zou morning and make contributions to the collective offering for the monks.
* Two lotteries are held: one for laymen to use the gilded begging bowl and another for monks to receive the offerings.
* Monks receive trays laden with food, money, toiletries, etc., while the congregation remains informal.

## Religious Observances During Lent

* After the sermon, prayers are chanted, including the Confession of Faith.
* The ceremony concludes in fifteen minutes.
* Those not observing precepts return to their fields; others engage in pious activities like visiting monasteries or pilgrimage centers.

## Religious Activity During Lent

* During Lent, villagers spend more time on private devotions, attend evening chapel more frequently, and try to observe Sabbaths.
* Women cook food for the Buddha, and the village sodality collects offerings on Sabbath eve.

## Solicitation Of Donations

* The Lenten period is a popular time for representatives of outside organizations to solicit donations for various religious purposes.
* These emissaries often deliver learned discourses and serve as a source of news and connection with other villages.

## The First Festival Of Lights
* Celebrated on the full moon of October (Thadin:jut).
* Commemorates the Buddha's descent from heaven after expounding Buddhist teachings.
* Marked by lighting oil lamps, candles, and electric bulbs before Buddha images, in homes, and around pagodas.

## The Robe-Offering Ceremony
* Takes place during a one-month period following Thadin:jut.
* Involves offering yellow robes to monks collectively rather than individually.
* Believed to bring merit leading to respect, wealth, beauty, power, long life, health, etc.
* Includes the "wishing tree" (padei-tha bin), a structure adorned with gifts for the monks.

## The Second Festival Of Lights
* Celebrated on the full moon of November (Tazaung-mon:).
* Commemorates the robe offered by Buddha's mother when he renounced his princely life.
* Involves villagers staying up all night stitching a special robe to be offered to a monk or draped around a Buddha image.

## The Full Moon Of February (Tabou:Dwe:)
* Reasons for celebration are unclear to villagers.
* Marked by offerings of scented wood lit and placed before Buddha images in pagodas, symbolizing warmth for the Buddha during the cold season.

## Pagoda Festivals

* Pagoda festivals commemorate the founding of a pagoda and occur throughout the year, unlike Buddhist holydays which are tied to Sabbath days.
* These festivals are characterized by a festive mood, with participants engaging in activities like shopping, eating, and attending performances.
* While religious homage is paid to the Buddha, extra-religious motivations such as social interaction, recreation, and economic activity also play a significant role.

## The Ceremonial Cycle: I. Life-Cycle Rituals 




## Introduction

* Buddhism is generally not involved in life cycle events compared to other religions.
* While Burmese society has rites for these events, most are not Buddhist.
* There's no clear explanation for Buddhism's lack of involvement despite its focus on worldly matters in some areas.

## The "Auspicious" Ceremonies

* There are twelve non-recurrent "auspicious" ceremonies in Burma, excluding funerals.
* Only one is Buddhist (male adolescent initiation).
* Five include peripheral Buddhist elements, while seven have none.
* Most involve propitiation of nats (spirits).


## The Individual Ceremonies

* Pregnancy ceremony: No Buddhist elements.
* Birth ceremony: Sometimes monks recite paritta for a safe delivery.
* Head-washing ceremony: No Buddhist elements.
* Hair-shaving ceremony: Not observed in Yeigyi, no Buddhist elements.
* Cradle ceremony: Monks may be invited for a feast and homily, but not part of the core ceremony.
* Naming ceremony: No Buddhist elements.
* Cloth-wearing ceremony: Not observed in Yeigyi, no Buddhist elements.
* Rice-feeding ceremony: Some see symbolic connection to the Three Gems (Buddha, Law, Order).
* Ear-boring ceremony (girls): No Buddhist elements.
* Hair-tying ceremony (boys): No Buddhist elements.

## The Male Adolescent Initiation

* This is the most important Buddhist ceremony in Burma.

## The Marriage Ceremony

* Entirely secular, no Buddhist elements in the ceremony itself.
* Monks may be invited for a feast and recitation of paritta on the wedding day, but do not participate in the ceremony.




## Buddhist Initiation

* The shin-byu is the most important Burmese Buddhist ceremony, marking a boy's temporary ordination as a novice monk.

* It symbolizes the transition from a biosocial being to a spiritual one and grants merit to both the initiate and his sponsors.

* Typically held after harvest and before Lent, it involves shaving the boy's head, reciting faith in the Three Gems, requesting initiation, and donning the yellow robe.

* The ceremony is expensive, with costs ranging from K200 to K5,000, reflecting the importance of display and prestige for the sponsors.
* While the religious significance remains, there is a growing emphasis on extravagance and social standing associated with the shin-byu.


## The Significance of Merit

* Merit (da-na) is acquired through various acts, but sponsoring a shin-byu is considered the noblest form.

* Parents are expected to sponsor their son's initiation for both religious and social reasons.
* The merit gained by sponsoring an initiation is believed to be qualitatively different and essential for attaining nirvana.


## The Role of Sponsors

* Invitations emphasize the sponsors' almsgiving, anticipated merit, and intention to share it with others. 
* The ceremony highlights the sponsor's generosity and social standing rather than focusing solely on the initiate.

* The display aspect of the shin-byu directly contributes to the sponsor's prestige (goung:) and is considered crucial for social acceptance.


## Variations in Ceremony

* While the basic structure remains consistent, variations exist in the display elements across villages and regions.
* A Yeigyi monk observed a shift towards prioritizing prestige over religious conviction in contemporary shin-byu ceremonies.

## The Burmese Shin-byu Initiation Ceremony

* **The Ceremony's Structure:** The shin-byu initiation ceremony typically spans three days. Day one involves offerings to village spirits and a feast for monks. Day two is the main event with processions, ear-boring for girls, and offerings at monasteries. Day three focuses on the ritual performance by the Master of Ceremony inside the palace.

* **Ear-Boring (Natwin):** Although historically unrelated to Buddhist initiation, ear-boring has become inextricably linked to it. It's primarily performed on girls between four and seven years old, often coinciding with a brother's initiation. While lacking religious significance, it provides the girl with a moment of glory alongside her brother.

* **Symbolism and Regalia:** The ceremony draws heavily from Buddhist mythology, particularly the story of Prince Siddhartha renouncing his royal life for enlightenment. The boys are dressed as princes, symbolizing their renunciation of worldly pleasures to become monks.

* **The Procession:** After the feast, a procession accompanies the initiates to monasteries where offerings are made and monastic requisites are deposited. This procession involves village elders, "village belles," the initiates on horseback, princesses in an oxcart, guests, musicians, and a papier-mache elephant.

* **The Master of Ceremony's Role:** The core of the initiation is the ritual performance by the Master of Ceremony inside the palace. He entertains the audience with chants, songs, dialogues, sermons, legends, and jokes, weaving them into a dramatic fabric.  He also performs shin-byu specific rites.

* **The Ritual Performance:** The Master of Ceremony begins by paying respects to various figures, including the Buddha and his teachers. He then recounts his own biography and prepares a talisman for the initiates. His performance includes sermons on topics like grasping, the three truths, and karmic retribution. He also invokes the Buddha into the palace and guides the initiates in obeisance to their parents and relatives.





## # The Shin-byu Ceremony

* The ceremony begins with instructions on honoring parents and praising women. 
* The Master of Ceremony emphasizes purity for women.
* Initiates are instructed to respect grandparents, teachers, and even kings (except drunken ones).
* A story is told about a powerful king who was unable to fly over the initiates due to their noble status as future Sons of the Buddha.

## # Feeding Ceremony and Protection

* Cooked rice mixed with water is fed to initiates for protection.
* A thread chanted over with paritta (protective verses) is placed around their necks.
* The Master of Ceremony sings the Victory Song, sprinkles water, and places eugenia leaves in their hair for further protection.

## # Nat Theik Ceremony

* Spirits (both Buddhist deva and Burmese nat) are invited to the palace.
* They are offered food and drink from three bowls containing coconuts and bananas.
* A clown solicits contributions from the audience, making humorous remarks about donations and nirvana.

## # Ear Piercing and Conclusion

* The Master of Ceremony pricks the girls' ears with a needle.
* He announces the ceremony's completion, stating that the real masters of ceremony will arrive later with Buddhist monks.

## # Shaving and Robing

* After guests depart, boys are taken to have their heads shaved and change into yellow robes.
* A monk begins the shaving, followed by a layman. 
* The boy recites the Ten Precepts and Buddhist Confession of Faith, becoming a novice (kou-yin).


## # Concluding Ceremony at the Palace

* The initiate returns to the palace as a mendicant.
* A group of monks conducts the ceremony, with a senior monk preaching about the benefits of the shin-byu.
* The sponsor expresses a wish for nirvana, and water libation is performed jointly by the sponsor and his wife.

## # Final Rituals

* Monks are feasted, followed by chanting paritta and the giving of new Pali names to the postulants.
* A final water libation is performed, and the senior monk delivers a sermon comparing the sponsor to the Buddha.
* The ceremony ends with the sanctification of a Buddha image and a final meal for guests.

## # Post-Initiation Life

* While the ceremony emphasizes display and merit acquisition by the sponsor, the initiate is formally inducted into the Buddhist Order.
* He resides in the monastery, receives Buddhist education, and leaves daily to receive alms.
* He is expected to sever ties with his secular life, treating his parents as any other revered member of the monkhood.

## # Duration of Stay in Monastery

* The norm is three Lenten seasons (approximately three years), but this varies greatly in practice.
* Reasons for variation include economic factors, family needs, and the age of the initiate.
* A contemporary sample shows shorter stays, often due to longing for parents, hunger pangs, or the need to help with fieldwork.

## Sometimes, of course, a lengthy stay in the monastery stimulates the novice to consider the monastic life as a career.

* Some discover that they have a religious vocation; others are attracted by the relative indolence and comfort which is theirs in the monastery.
* The latter group accounts, in part, for the high percentage of Burmese monks who obviously have no "calling" at all.
* In the sample of twenty-four boys alluded to above it is interesting that the majority viewed their monastic experience as a happy one.

## Death And Burial

* Although Buddhism is scarcely involved in one's entry into the world, it is involved in many ways in one's exit.
* If birth and childhood ceremonies are primarily concerned with nat, death ceremonies are the concern primarily of Buddhism.
* In normative Buddhism there is no soul; hence, nothing survives the death of the body.

* Rebirth is caused by the deceased's craving for existence; the nature of his rebirth is determined by his personally created karma.
* This being so, the bereaved has no power to do good or ill for the deceased.
* Buddhism in Burma becomes involved with death, not after a person dies, but in the process of his dying.

* For, according to certain Buddhist teachings, a person's rebirth is importantly determined by his state of mind immediately prior to his death.
* In order to achieve these latter states of mind, it is necessary to concentrate on Buddhist ideas—especially the concepts of suffering, impermanence, and nonself—and to repose one's faith in the soteriological virtues of the Three Gems.

* The less sophisticated believe that these rituals have the power, on the one hand, to overcome satanic powers which wish to deliver the soul of the nether world, and on the other hand, to send the soul to a heavenly abode.
* After death, the deceased lies in state in his own house for a minimum of three days before he is buried or cremated.

* Immediately after death, the corpse is washed: typically, by relatives, and always by males.
* On the one hand, it is believed that the soul (leikpya) remains near the house until it is finally exorcised five to seven days after the funeral.
* It is also believed that the soul may be hostile, angry, or evil, and rituals are performed to protect the family from its hostility.

* From the time of death until the day of the funeral, a steady stream of visitors passes through the household.
* Every night, beginning with the first night after death and continuing until the monks recite the paritta which permanently expel the soul from the world of the living, the house and courtyard of the deceased are filled with groups of men who gamble at cards until dawn.

* Although the ghost is feared, it is not ignored. Before the burial, for example, jaggery (a form of molasses) and rice are placed in a bowl at the cemetery for the ghost to eat, and when the corpse is buried the bowl is placed with the body inside the coffin.
* While lying in state the deceased is swathed in burial clothes, his thumbs and big toes tied together with hair cut from the head of one of his children.

* A vase, holding a flower, is placed by the head of the corpse so that, the villagers say, the ghost may use it to worship the Buddha.
* If the family can afford it, monks are invited to the house every morning before the day of the funeral and, after they are feasted, recite paritta.

* Although the gambling is restricted to the night hours, the bereaved are not left alone during the day.
* On the morning of the funeral wealthy villagers invite monks to the house for a feast.


* When the body is taken from the house to be carried to the cemetery, it is removed through a back door or a window.

* It is carried on a bier or a bed borne by four men, one at each corner.
* As the corpse is lifted to the shoulders of the pallbearers, there is brief ritualized wailing by the female relatives.

* The funeral procession walks in single file, the men following the bier and the women walking behind them.
* When the procession reaches the cemetery, the body is taken by a small group of men to be buried or cremated.




# Funeral Ceremonies

* The number of monks invited to a funeral depends on the wealth of the family. 
* More monks mean more merit transferred to the deceased.
* Monks are offered alms (bananas and coconuts) and money placed in fans carried by their pupils.
* The ceremony involves chanting paritta, sermons about impermanence, and water libation.

# Seventh Day Ceremony

* Fourteen days after the funeral, monks are invited again for a feast and paritta recitation.
* This helps drive away lingering ghosts and transfer merit to the deceased.
* The number of monks invited depends on the family's wealth.

# General Observations

* Burmese death rituals combine Buddhist beliefs with pre-Buddhist and folk traditions.
* These rituals aim to protect survivors from the deceased's ghost and ensure a favorable rebirth for the deceased.
* Merit is transferred to the deceased through offerings and chanting.

# Anniversary Ceremonies

* On the anniversary of a death, relatives perform meritorious acts (like offering alms or building pagodas) and transfer merit to the deceased.

# Crisis Rituals

* These rituals are performed to protect against calamities, both natural and karmic.
* Examples include accidents, illness, theft, droughts, and attacks.
* While naturalistic solutions are often used, Buddhist rituals provide additional protection and reassurance. 




## 255

* Burmese people use both naturalistic and supernatural techniques to cope with dangers.
* Supernatural dangers include witchcraft, spirits, planetary influence, evil omens, and bad fortune.
* Protection against these dangers comes from nat cultus rituals, magical rituals (Buddhist and non-Buddhist), and apotropaic Buddhism.

## The Use Of Buddhist Sacra The Rosary

* The rosary is a generic prophylactic against danger for pious Buddhists.
* It is also used as an antidote against specific troubles like bombings, unemployment, and imprisonment.

## The Pagoda

* Pagodas are built to avert dangers caused by planetary influence and terrestrial omens.
* A famous example is the World Peace Pagoda in Kaba-Aye, Rangoon, built to avert impending war.
* Due to cost and time constraints, smaller brick pagodas or miniature sand pagodas are sometimes built instead.

## A Buddha Symbol

* Burmese peasants believe a fish symbol in a pagoda represents the Buddha in a previous incarnation.
* This fish is believed to have the power to bring rain.
* During droughts, the fish image is carried in a procession through fields, followed by chanting monks and villagers.

## The Buddha Image

* A small pagoda in Lethit village houses a special hooded-Buddha image about a foot high, representing protection against snake bites.
* According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha was protected from a rainstorm by a naga king who covered him with his hood.
* Burmese tradition tells of a young King Kyanzittha being protected by a naga while fleeing danger.
* The hooded-serpent image is believed to offer protection against snakes based on these traditions and Frazer's principle of sympathetic magic.
* Rituals involving the image include prayers for protection, tying dried flowers offered to the image around wrists or hats as talismans, and pilgrimages to the pagoda.

* When someone is bitten by a snake, they are taken to the pagoda where rituals are performed, including reciting precepts, consuming flowers and water offered to the image, and massaging the wound with these offerings.
* The belief in the image's curative power is based on past experiences of people recovering from snake bites after visiting the pagoda.

## The Yellow Robe :

* The yellow robe worn by monks possesses great magical power, particularly against evil supernaturals like witches and spirits.
* Taking monastic vows and donning the yellow robe is seen as ultimate protection for victims of spirit possession or witchcraft who fear further attacks.

## The Use Of Buddhist Spells

* "Spells" are verbal formulas believed to achieve desired goals through magical power or by invoking superhuman beings.
* Buddhist spells, known as gathas, typically consist of scriptural passages and include the Virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
* These Virtues are used for protection in various situations, including battles, healing, and seeking release from imprisonment.

* The Tham-bouktei spell is considered even more powerful than the Virtues, invoking the protection of countless Buddhas.
* Villagers share anecdotes about the Tham-bouktei's power to save people from shipwrecks, airplane crashes, and insurgent attacks.

* Paritta are a collection of eleven suttas recited for protection against generalized or specific dangers.
* They are central to Burmese crisis ritual and are considered indispensable for personal security.
* Monks often perform paritta ceremonies on behalf of laymen, who also learn some paritta in village monastery schools.
* While memorized in Pali, most paritta are recited in Burmese during lay devotions.

## Khandha Paritta

* This paritta is recited for protection from dangerous creatures, originally snakes.
* It expresses love (metta) towards all living beings.
* The recitation involves opening windows so that all creatures can hear the loving expressions.

## Mora Paritta

* Believed to be efficacious in protecting against arrest and freeing those who have been arrested.
* Invokes a powerful, golden-light being for protection.
* Expresses reverence for saints, the righteous, and wisdom.

## Atanatiya (Burmese, Atanariya) Paritta

* Used to combat dangers caused by evil spirits and supernatural beings.

## Angulimāla (Burmese, Ingulimala) Paritta

* Recited during difficult and dangerous childbirths.
* The speaker affirms their non-violent nature since birth, wishing well-being for the mother and unborn child.

## Vattaka (Burmese, Wuda) Paritta

* Protects against fire.
* Addresses the "Lord of Fire" with a plea to turn back.

## Bojjhanga Sutta (Burmese, Boukzin Thouk)

* Recited for protection against illness.
* Discusses four types of deeds: dark, bright, both dark and bright, and neither dark nor bright.
* Emphasizes the importance of wisdom qualities like mindfulness, dhamma-search, energy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.

## Pubbanha Sutta (Burmese, Poukpana Thouk)

* Protects from epidemics and dangers caused by the twelve planets.
* Promotes righteous actions, speech, and thoughts for a happy dawn, noon, and evening.

## Mangala (Burmese, Min-Gala) Sutta

* Composed by the Buddha to answer a deva's question about the highest blessing.
* Recited for protection from danger and achieving various goals.
* Lists numerous blessings, including cultivating wise companions, living righteously, protecting relatives, refraining from sin, practicing contentment, and realizing Nibbana.

## Mettā (Burmese, Myitta) Sutta

* Believed to protect from evil spirits because reciting it earns the love of Brahma and samma deva.
* Emphasizes qualities like skillfulness, uprightness, conscientiousness, gentleness, contentment, calmness, wisdom, and non-greediness.
* Encourages boundless loving-kindness towards all beings.

## Ratana (Burmese, Yadana) Sutta

* A long sutta recited in situations of danger, especially those caused by supernatural forces.




## The Use Of Dāna

* Offerings to the Buddha, deva, and monks are made as part of Buddhist apotropaic rituals.
* Merit accrues from dana, which can be increased by offering special meals to monks. 
* Monks act as an insurance policy against dangers, with regular feeding representing premium payments and feasts during crises representing special assessments.

* Another form of merit-producing dana involves purchasing animals destined for slaughter to save their lives.
* This practice is considered a powerful way to acquire merit due to its alignment with the Buddhist precepts against killing and metta (loving-kindness).


## The Use Of Meditation

* Meditation in contemporary Burma is used to cope with various problems, including dissatisfaction with life, insomnia, psychosomatic complaints, identifying enemies, and curing physical and mental illnesses.
* Some meditation masters claim to have cured serious ailments like cancer through their techniques.
* This use of meditation reflects a shift from its traditional role as a means for achieving enlightenment to a tool for addressing worldly concerns.

## Non-Buddhist Magic

* Non-Buddhist magic primarily consists of talismans, such as amulets worn on the body, which are believed to offer protection from various dangers.
* Tattoos were also used as talismans in the past, but are less common today.
* Other forms of non-Buddhist magic include charms inserted under the skin for invulnerability and rituals like dismembering a corpse to prevent misfortune.

* While not officially sanctioned by Buddhist scriptures, these practices are often seen as Buddhist because they utilize Buddhist power and symbols.
* Monks sometimes participate in these practices, further blurring the lines between Buddhist and non-Buddhist magic.




## The Monk As Religious Virtuoso

* Buddhism is conceived as a virtuoso religion where true Buddhists follow the Buddha's path to salvation through renunciation of the world.
* The ideal Buddhist is the monk (bhikkhu), who renounces worldly ties and lives according to a rule of asceticism. 
* Although "monk" is a common translation for bhikkhu, it has limitations as Christian monasticism differs from Buddhist practice.

##  Buddhist Monasticism: Origins and Nature

* Buddhist monasticism originated from pre-Buddhist ascetic movements in ancient India, influenced by the Upanishads' emphasis on renunciation.
* The Buddha's community of monks (Sangha) likely emerged as a sect within the wandering parivrajaka ascetics, recognizing the Buddha as their Master.
* Early Sangha members lived as hermits but gradually transitioned to a more settled life, leading to the development of the Buddhist coenobium.

## The Normative Emphasis on the Monk

* Buddhism emphasizes the monk as the ideal Buddhist due to the nature of its message and the focus of its scriptures.
* The Buddha himself states that renunciation is most conducive to the Buddhist life.

##  The Sociological Structure of a Buddhist Society

* Psychologically and sociologically, world renunciation cannot be a mass phenomenon.
* A Buddhist society consists of a small core of world-renouncing monks supported by a larger laity who cherish and uphold Buddhist values.
* The size of the monastic minority varies across time and space.

# The Number of Monks in Burma

* Obtaining an accurate estimate of the number of monks in Burma is difficult due to the fluidity of the monastic population and resistance from the Burmese Order against censuses.
* Estimates suggest that monks constitute around 5% of the total population and 10% of the male population.
* Historical data indicates a possible increase in the monastic population in modern times compared to earlier periods.

# The Function Of Monasticism

* The primary function of Buddhist monasticism, according to Burmese monks, is to promote the monk's own spiritual welfare and pursuit of nirvana.
* While monks acknowledge the importance of serving laymen through teaching Buddhism and performing rituals, they consider these secondary to their personal salvation.
* Laymen also recognize that a monk's primary duty is to seek his own salvation, as it is through supporting pious monks that they acquire merit for their own spiritual progress.
* Unlike the priest-layman relationship in Christianity, where priests assist laymen in achieving salvation, the Buddhist monk-layman relationship involves laymen assisting monks in their pursuit of enlightenment.
* Buddhist monasticism focuses on otherworldly goals (lokuttara) rather than worldly concerns (lokiya), meaning monks are not expected to be involved in social service or community welfare activities.

# Monks and Village Morality

* Monks rarely apply moral concepts from sermons to specific village issues.
* They avoid roles as moralists or prophets.
* Their focus remains on otherworldly goals rather than worldly matters.

# Monks and Nation-Building

* Burmese monks generally refuse to participate in development programs like road construction or school building.
* They believe such activities violate monastic rules and are irrelevant to their spiritual pursuits.
* This attitude is shared by monks in other Theravada societies, though there are some exceptions.

# Thai Monks and Development

* In central Thailand, monks encourage development but don't directly participate in manual labor.
* In northeast Thailand, monks actively participate in village development projects.
* The Thai government has encouraged monk involvement in nation-building, which is a relatively new phenomenon.

# Social Service Sangha Association

* A small group of Burmese monks established orphanages and formed the Social Service Sangha Association.
* They believe serving others contributes to their own spiritual progress and helps orphans achieve nirvana.
* This view contrasts with the majority of monks who see social service as irrelevant or even detrimental to their goals.




## The Rule Ordination

*  The Buddhist monk adheres to a set of norms and regulations known as the monastic Rule, which governs their behavior within the Buddhist Order of monks.

*  To become a monk, one must be male, free from communicable diseases and debts, not illegitimate or a slave, have parental consent, and possess basic knowledge of Buddhism.
*  Ordination as a novice (pabbajja) is required before receiving higher ordination for the monkhood. Novices must be at least eight years old and follow 105 rules, including the Ten Precepts.

* The higher ordination ceremony involves taking vows of poverty, chastity, and homelessness. It takes place in a special ordination chamber (thein), with astrological calculations determining the time, date, and monastic name.
* During the ceremony, the candidate affirms their eligibility and requests admission to the monkhood. After confirming no objections, the presiding monk pronounces the candidate a monk and reads aloud the first section of the Rule (parajika).

* Upon ordination, the monk undergoes a civil death, relinquishing all possessions and inheritable property. They receive gifts from the faithful, including the yellow robe, begging bowl, and other essential items. The razor is used for shaving head, beard, and eyebrows to eliminate vanity.




## The Rule

* The Patimokkha is a compendium of rules for Buddhist monks, recited twice monthly.
* It contains 27 regulations classified into eight categories based on severity.
* The four parajika rules are the core and result in expulsion for violation: no sexual intercourse, no taking what isn't freely given, no intentional killing, and no claiming supernatural powers.

## The Second Category of Rules

* Thirteen rules result in probation and penance.
* They cover topics like avoiding sexual misconduct, not engaging in inappropriate conversations with women, and respecting other monks.

## Other Rules

* Numerous rules govern daily life, including eating, behavior, relationships, and monastic practices.
* Some are considered more onerous by laymen, such as refraining from eating after noon.

## The Purpose of the Rule

* The Rule primarily regulates monks' physical desires, especially lust.
* This reflects Buddhism's focus on overcoming desire and achieving detachment through meditation and adherence to the rules.

## Asceticism in Indian Religions

* Indian asceticism, including Buddhist monasticism, aims for Liberation.
* It involves practices like self-denial, meditation, and seeking mystical experiences.
* While magical powers can be a byproduct, the ultimate goal is transcendence and freedom from suffering.




## Ascetic Orientation

* Buddhist monks possess no property and abstain from sex and food after noon, minimizing physical pleasures.
* Their attitude towards monastic requisites (food, clothing, shelter, medicine) is strictly utilitarian, focused on fulfilling basic needs rather than indulgence.
* While emphasizing desire suppression, Buddhist asceticism differs from Christian and Hindu monasticism in its moderation.

## The Nature of Buddhist Asceticism

* Buddhist asceticism aims to extinguish desire, viewed as a hindrance to salvation, not a sin requiring atonement.
* Desire cannot be eradicated through bodily torture but through meditation and adherence to the Rule.
* Buddhism doesn't oppose bodily mortification in principle but deems it ineffective for achieving its goal of extinguishing desire.

## The Body and Sexuality

* Sexual desire is considered the greatest temptation, with succumbing to it being a grave dereliction for monks.
* Buddhist scriptures portray the body as loathsome, emphasizing its repulsive nature to discourage attachment.
* Monks are instructed to avoid women and view them as mothers, sisters, or children to minimize temptation.


## The Goal of Meditation

* The aim is to achieve insight into the true nature of the body, seeing it in all its loathsomeness to extinguish desire.
* Buddhist meditation, particularly asubha-bhavana, encourages contemplation of the body's impurities and decay.
* This practice aims to cultivate detachment from the body and redirect desires towards nirvana.

## Rationale for Monastic Rules

* The primary objective of the Rule is to suppress and ultimately extinguish bodily desire, especially sexual desire.
* Monks cite various reasons for adhering to rules like abstaining from food after noon and sexual activity, all ultimately aimed at extinguishing desire.
* These practices are believed to promote meditation, spiritual growth, and the attainment of nirvana.

# Monasticism: I. The Rationale of Asceticism

* Monks and laymen believe that monastic rules are designed to decrease passions and worldly attachments, thereby purifying the mind for meditation and nirvana pursuit.
* Sexual prohibitions are considered most important as they are seen as major obstacles to achieving nirvana.
* Laymen are expected to limit sensual indulgence while monks must suppress it entirely.

# Structural Elaboration

* The original monastic rules have evolved into a complex system of ecclesiastical law with numerous subregulations.
* The yellow robe, a symbol of poverty and monastic office, has specific regulations regarding its use, wear, and bestowal.
* Different types of robes exist, each with unique significance and occasions for offering.
* The kahteing robe is the most important for monks as it confers privileges and exemptions from certain rules.

# Confession

* The Patimokkha (monastic rule) is recited twice a month as a form of communal discipline.
* Monastic confession, known as dei-thana kya:de, occurs twice a month for minor and major infractions.
* Minor offenses are confessed to any monk while graver offenses require confession in the ordination chamber before three monks who prescribe penance.
* Failure to confess results in punishment from guardian spirits and the deva in the next existence.
* A special ceremony is performed at intervals for confessing accumulated offenses over several years.


# Monasticism: Ii. The Social Structure 


## The Daily Routine

* The monk's daily routine is predictable due to the monastic Rule and the physical limitations of the monastery compound.

* Monks are prohibited from entering the village except for specific religious duties like collecting alms or officiating at funerals.

* A typical day begins with sweeping, devotions, morning tea, alms rounds, a main meal served by novices, free time for study or rest, a snack, teaching school children, more free time, evening devotions, and bedtime.

## The Monk's Role in the Village

* Monks have minimal interaction with villagers on typical days.
* They lead religious recitations on Sabbaths and holydays, chant paritta on special occasions, preside over initiation ceremonies, receive special meals from laymen, and occasionally preach sermons.
* Some villagers consult monks for advice on Buddhist concepts, meditation, astrology, or personal issues, but not for pastoral guidance.

## Material Abundance in Monastic Life

* Despite the ideal of renunciation, Burmese monastic life is characterized by material abundance compared to the average layman's life.
* Monks receive new robes annually, enjoy multiple curries at each meal, and often have their alms food collected by novices or lay students.
* Laymen frequently prepare special meals for monks, inviting them to homes on ceremonial occasions or simply to acquire merit.

* Some monks rely entirely on donations from wealthy patrons who provide daily meals.




# The Monastic Compound and Its Inhabitants

* The monastic compound is spacious and airy, often located within a garden setting. 
* It provides refuge from the tropical sun and offers a high standard of living for monks.
* Monks receive generous gifts (kahteing) despite renouncing material possessions.

# The Structure Of The Monastery

* Although not bound to a specific monastery, Burmese monks typically spend their first ten years in the monastery where they were ordained. 
* After that, they can transfer to any other monastery.
* Monasteries are democratic institutions with universalistic criteria for recruitment and promotion.
* However, there is a hierarchical structure based on status terms.

# Status Hierarchy within the Monastery

* The hierarchy includes young novices (kou-yin galei:), novices (kou-yin), fully ordained monks (u.pazin:), senior monks (hpoung:ji:), and the presiding abbot (hsaya-do).
* Deference is shown to those of higher status through ritual obeisance and service.

# Mealtime Hierarchy

* Monks eat in order of their status, with the presiding monk eating first.
* Status within each rank is determined by the number of years spent as a monk ("ecclesiastical age").

# Administrative Structure

* Monasteries are nominally under the jurisdiction of a district superior (gaing: ouk).
* Village monasteries are relatively autonomous, while city monasteries have a more complex structure with multiple buildings and an abbot (taik ouk).

# Types of Monasteries

* Village monastery (ywa caung:) - Single building, inhabited by a few monks, novices, and possibly students.
* City monastery (caung: taik) - Complex of buildings housing many monks, sometimes serving as centers for higher study or meditation.
* Forest hermitage (to-ya. caung:) - Isolated dwelling for monks focused on meditation, supported by nearby villages.

# Monastic Property

* Theoretically limited to the eight "requisites" provided by lay supporters.
* In practice, monks and monasteries have accumulated significant property due to changing interpretations of "necessity."
* Two types: corporate (sanghika) belonging to the monastic order and personal (poggalika) belonging to individual monks.

# Corporate vs Personal Property

* Distinction between these types is crucial, as occupying a privately owned monastery without consent has serious consequences.

# On My Way to Attend the Funeral

* The narrator encountered villagers who believed a deceased monk's successor had become a demon.
* They attributed this belief to the unusual number of recent deaths among the monastery's incumbents.
* The headman confirmed these deaths but refused to elaborate further.
* The monks present saw nothing unusual in the deaths, attributing them to impermanence and inevitability.

# The Structure Of The Order

* The Sangha, or Buddhist monastic order, is not a homogeneous group, historically experiencing splits and divisions.
* A major division exists between Mahāyāna and Therāvada Buddhism.
* Within Therāvada Buddhism, further divisions exist based on sociological and ideological grounds.
* In Burma, the Sangha has been divided into branches, termed "gaing:" by locals.

# The Burmese Branches

* The Burmese Sangha is currently divided into four branches: Thu.dama, Shwei-jin, Dwara, and Hngettwin:.
* Thu.dama is the largest branch, followed by Shwei-jin.
* Shwei-jin differs from Thu.dama in its stricter adherence to monastic discipline, forbidding smoking, betel chewing, certain beverages after noon, and witnessing popular entertainment.

# The Hngettwin: Branch

* Hngettwin: emphasizes moral thought (mano-gan) as crucial for upholding Buddhist precepts.
* It views many conventional rituals as "Hindu" and inconsistent with Buddhist doctrine.
* Hngettwin: opposes the worship of Buddha images, believing only His spirit should be venerated.

# The Dwara Branch

* Dwara shares similarities with Hngettwin: in its emphasis on mental attitude for moral evaluation.
* It emphasizes the "source" (Dwara) of actions as crucial for their ethical significance.


# Historical Divisions

* Rival monastic branches have existed in Burma since the beginning of Burmese Buddhism.
* Early divisions arose from disagreements about ordination practices and monastic discipline.
* In the 15th century, King Dhammazedi attempted to unify the Sangha by reintroducing the upasampada ordination from Ceylon.
* This unification was short-lived, with further divisions arising in the 18th century over differences in monastic attire and practices.

# The Monk: I. Recruitment Structure
* This chapter explores the persistence of the monastic order by examining its recruitment structure. 
* It argues that understanding recruitment is crucial for explaining the survival of institutions.
* The focus is on permanent members of the Order, excluding temporary monks and those with non-monastic motives.

#  Introduction
* Burmese monks are men who have embraced monastic life as a vocation.
* While monks share similarities with other Burmese men, there are differences that lead them to enter the monastery.

* Three stereotypical motives for becoming a monk are identified: religious motives, escaping suffering, and seeking an easy life.

# The Monk: I. Recruitment Structure (continued)
*  The "easy living" motive is considered by some to be prevalent but doesn't fully explain recruitment as many aspire to comfort without becoming monks.
* Attributing monasticism solely to religiosity is insufficient as it doesn't define what makes someone more religious.

* The desire for nirvana, while common among both monks and laymen, doesn't explain why some choose monastic life over lay life.
* It is suggested that character traits, rather than cultural or social factors, might be key in distinguishing potential monks from laymen.




## The Sociological Background Macrosociological Influences

* Burmese monks predominantly come from rural backgrounds.
* This is consistent with data from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and anecdotal evidence from Mandalay and Rangoon.
* Two explanations offered by Burmese monks are: 1) urban youth are less willing to suffer monastic privations, and 2) village families are more religious and prioritize nirvana.
* An abbot in Mandalay suggested that poverty plays a role, as villagers are more likely to enter the monastery for a better standard of living and social status.

* However, poverty alone doesn't explain the urban-rural imbalance, as poor boys in cities don't become monks.

* Another factor is the difference in education: rural boys typically attend monastery schools while urban boys attend state schools.
* Monastery schools were once the only educational institutions in Burma, but after the British conquest, secular schools became more prevalent, emptying urban monastery schools.
* This has created a stigma against monastery students among urban children, making monastic recruitment difficult.

* The data supports this explanation: except for one monk, all monks in the sample received exclusively monastic education.

* Urbanization and affluence pose a threat to the numerical strength of the Order.


## Microsociological Influences

* Socioeconomic background alone doesn't explain monastic recruitment; most men from poor rural backgrounds don't become monks.
* Most monks decide to join the Order before their twenties, while studying in monastery schools or as novices.
* Teachers and family members influence this decision: most monks had relatives who were monks, and all parents either encouraged or approved of their sons' decisions.

* Early exposure to monastic life is crucial for recruitment. Village boys immersed in the monastery environment are more likely to identify with and prefer the monastic way of life.

* Monastic teachers serve as role models, inspiring young boys to emulate them.
* For poor village boys, the monastery offers a better standard of living and social status compared to their families' circumstances.
* Despite these incentives, only a small minority choose monastic life, suggesting other opposing influences exist.

## Countervailing Influences

* Some monks are harsh disciplinarians and instill fear in their students, making monastic life less appealing. 
* Monastic life can be boring due to restrictions on activities and lack of intellectual stimulation. Monks often resort to sleeping or engaging in mundane pursuits to alleviate boredom.
* The ascetic aspects of monastic life, such as celibacy and dietary restrictions, pose challenges for some novices who find them difficult to adhere to.

##  The Rule as an Impediment 


* Monastic regulations are strict and their violation carries severe karmic consequences, leading to anxiety among novices about their ability to comply.
* The perceived higher stakes for monks compared to laymen in terms of karmic repercussions make the decision to enter monastic life more daunting.

## Some Motivational Bases For Recruitment: Conscious World-Renunciation

* Most monks cite suffering, the desire to escape it, or the hope of achieving nirvana as reasons for joining the Order.
* Some also mention the comfortable monastery life and the opportunity to teach Buddhism.
* These monks are world-rejectors, but their motivations differ based on their background.

##  World-Renunciation: Ideological vs Experiential Inspiration

* Monks who entered directly from apprenticeships (hge-byu) cite abstract reasons like avoiding misery or achieving nirvana.
* They haven't experienced personal tragedy and view dukkha as a theoretical concept.
* Monks who entered after living in the world (to:dwet) became world-rejectors due to personal suffering.

##  Motives for Renunciation: Escaping a Difficult Life

* Some monks sought refuge from difficult lives, including poverty, labor, and abusive relationships.
* They saw the monastery as a place of peace and escape from worldly troubles.
* Even seemingly minor annoyances could drive individuals to seek monastic life.

##  Motives for Renunciation: Social and Family Responsibility

* Monks may also enter the Order to escape onerous social demands or family responsibilities.
* This includes avoiding the burden of supporting a family or dealing with marital problems.
* These motives align with Buddhist teachings on reducing suffering, even if they seem unconventional from a Western perspective.

# Personal frustration and/or tragedy.

* Monk I became a monk after a car accident left him crippled and filled with remorse for his past sins.
* Monk J turned to monastic life after losing his land and experiencing severe depression.
* Monk K entered a monastery to escape the "misery of existence" following the death of his wife.
* Monk L chose monasticism after his wife's infidelity, finding solace in meditation and sermons.

# Some Motivational Bases For Recruitment: Unconscious

* Conscious motives alone cannot fully explain why some individuals become monks.
* Unconscious needs and wishes also play a significant role in recruitment to achieved statuses like monasticism.
* Social roles allow for the disguised fulfillment of repressed, culturally prohibited desires. 
* The author suggests dependency, narcissism, and emotional timidity as potential unconscious motivators for becoming a monk.

## Need For Dependency

* This need refers to the desire to avoid responsibility (for oneself and others) and instead be taken care of and nurtured by others.
* While present in everyone, Buddhist monks exhibit an intense form of this need.

* Strong dependency needs lead men into the monastery and are a reason for them staying. 
* Monks find comfort and security in the monastery, but acknowledge that suffering (dukkha) is still present.
* Despite difficulties, they prefer monastic life to worldly responsibilities like work, family obligations, and financial burdens.

* Monks avoid village welfare activities because it involves responsibility and potential "dukkha." 
* The monastic life allows monks to avoid responsibility and satisfy their need for dependency.

* Laymen provide for all the monk's needs, mirroring a parent-child relationship.
* This relationship is asymmetrical; the monk expects his needs to be met without reciprocating in a tangible way.
* Monks view laymen as "givers of nourishment" and providers of nurturance.
* The emotional intensity of this dependency is evident in letters from monks to their sponsors, expressing helplessness and reliance on them for care.

* Burmese society generally exhibits strong dependency needs.
* Monks in the study often came from large families, were middle children, and had disrupted relationships with parents, potentially contributing to intensified dependency needs.


* The monk-layman relationship mirrors that of parent and child.
* The lay sponsor is referred to as "father" or "mother" of the monk.

* The specific period of childhood evoked by the monks' dependency is infancy, where needs are anticipated and met before being expressed.

# Narcissism

* Concern for oneself and one's needs, even at the expense of others, is a prominent trait in these monks.
* This egocentricity is evident in their focus on personal salvation and their desire to be cared for without reciprocation.
* Monastic narcissism manifests in both unofficial and official behaviors.

* **Unofficial Behavior:** Monks frequently make demands on laymen with little regard for the inconvenience caused. They expect others to run errands, make deliveries, or provide transportation without considering the time, effort, or expense involved.

* **Official Behavior:** At funerals, monks prioritize their own needs over those of the bereaved family. They are the focus of attention and care, while the grieving individuals receive little sympathy or consolation.
* The most blatant example of monastic narcissism is seen in the recruitment process. Many monks leave behind wives and children without considering the financial and emotional hardship this will cause.

* These men often enter the monastery without divorcing their wives, leaving them in a vulnerable position. While Burmese society generally admires those who become monks, they criticize men who do not divorce their wives before ordination, viewing it as selfish.
* The monastery provides a socially acceptable outlet for narcissistic needs, allowing individuals to escape domestic responsibilities while gaining admiration and religious validation.



## # The Monk: I. Recruitment Structure 

* The desire for complete freedom from worldly cares and fears is a common theme in Indian asceticism.
* This attitude is also found in Buddhist societies, exemplified by the story of Vessantara who abandons his family to pursue omniscience.
* The Jataka tale highlights Vessantara's willingness to sacrifice his children and wife for his own spiritual advancement.
* Buddhist myth and the Buddha himself sanction this narcissistic attitude towards family responsibilities.

## # Emotional Timidity

* Monks often exhibit a strong desire for dependency and avoid establishing emotional relationships due to fear of attachment and suffering.
* Despite acknowledging loneliness, they prefer solitude to prevent developing attachments that could cause pain.
* This "emotional timidity" extends beyond familial relationships and applies to all interpersonal connections.
* Burmese monks exemplify this attitude by directing their cathexis towards safe objects like the Buddha, avoiding the risk of emotional involvement with humans.

## # The Monk: Ii. Character Structure 




## Persistent Characteristics Of The "Worldling" Introduction

* Many people have exaggerated notions about the emotional qualities of religious individuals. 
* This chapter explores whether the Buddhist monastic life produces changes in monks that align with its goals and differentiate them from ordinary people ("worldlings").

## 351

* Burmese monks are generally perceived as having a warm, innocent, and naive quality.
* They exemplify "metta" (kindness) through their courtesy to strangers, hospitality, and generosity.
* Historical accounts highlight the charity of Burmese monks towards foreigners, including saving them from slavery and providing aid.

## Vanity

* Vanity is a prominent characteristic of Burmese monks.
* Monks often engage in self-praise, recounting their erudition, piety, adherence to rules, and popularity as preachers.
* They frequently seek praise from others and make invidious comparisons with other monks, claiming superiority in knowledge and understanding.

## Hostility

* A recurring theme in interviews with monks is their hostility towards other monks.
* Monks often criticize other monks for being ignorant, unlearned, avaricious, politically motivated, and interested only in prestige.
* They express a belief that most monks are not truly pious and that the Buddhist teaching is declining due to the lack of education and piety among monks. 




## Rivalry And Conflict

* Monks' hostility towards each other manifests in personal rivalry and conflict over prestige, status, and incumbency of monasteries.
* Conflict often arises from competition for monastery control, leading to disputes requiring intervention from government-sponsored Ecclesiastical Courts.
* Violence, including physical assault and bloodshed, can occur due to these disputes, particularly in urban areas.

## A Complex Dispute in Yeigyi

*  A dispute arose over the succession of a monastery in an adjacent village, involving U Thuta, the headman, and another monk claiming rightful inheritance.
* The dispute escalated into intense enmity between U Thuta and the resident monk, with accusations of Buddhist ignorance, Vinaya violations, and property theft.
* This conflict is part of a larger rivalry between U Thuta and U Pandeisa, senior monk of another monastery in Yeigyi.

## Ongoing Rivalry Between U Thuta and U Pandeisa

*  U Thuta and U Pandeisa clashed over the succession of another monastery, with U Pandeisa supporting two young monks designated by the deceased incumbent.
* The dispute involved a contested change in the monastery's ownership status, ultimately decided in favor of U Pandeisa's candidates.
* Their rivalry extends beyond monastic succession to encompass local influence and prestige, manifesting in accusations, boycotts of ceremonies, and public notices.

## Factionalism and Paranoia

*  The monks' rivalry fuels factionalism among villagers, with each monk aligning with different factions who support them in pagoda festivals and robe ceremonies.
* U Thuta exhibits paranoid tendencies, accusing the two brother monks allied with U Pandeisa of conspiring against him and alleging plots to drive him from his monastery.




## Worldly Values

* Many monks retain worldly values despite renouncing the world.
* They often view salvation in kammatic terms rather than nibbanic ones.
* Monks emphasize rewards of a pleasant rebirth in sermons to laymen, highlighting worldly benefits like wealth and beauty accruing from giving.
* Some monks express desires for material pleasures in future existences, even actively pursuing them in present life through circumlocutions.
* They display pride in modern facilities or connections with influential people, valuing worldly success.

## Intellectual Level

* The average monk's educational attainment and intellectual orientation are similar to laymen's.
* Village monks typically receive mediocre education confined to the monastery school, focusing on basic subjects and rote learning of religious texts.
* The Buddhist curriculum emphasizes memorization over analysis or inquiry, with limited exposure to philosophical concepts.
* Even those who pursue further studies in city monasteries face a similar emphasis on rote memory.

* Government-sponsored scriptural examinations reward only rote memorization, reinforcing this trend.
* Despite historical contributions to Buddhist scholarship, Burma's monastic tradition has been characterized by a lack of "creative" contributions to Buddhist thought.
* The government attempts to improve monks' education through postordination incentives like prizes and honorific titles for demonstrating Buddhist knowledge in competitive examinations.

# Financial Incentives for Monastic Education

* The government provides financial incentives to encourage monks to take examinations.
* Passing exams in Burmese earns K50, K75, and K100 for each level.
* An additional K25 is awarded for passing Pali exams.
* Dhammacariya exam passers receive K100 per test and K500 with honors.

# The Need for Monastic Universities

* The establishment of monastic universities was deemed necessary to improve the educational level of monks and monasteries.
* Incentives included financial prizes, honorary titles, degrees, free railway passes, and the prestige of belonging to a university.
* However, the impact of these universities has been limited, with only 42 monasteries achieving this status by 1962.

# Intellectual Level of Monks

* The intellectual level of the average monk is generally low due to low educational qualifications for entry into the Order, limited instruction in monasteries, and low motivation for study.
* This observation is consistent with historical accounts from the 19th century.

# Comparison with Laymen

* Many laymen are more informed and knowledgeable than monks.
* Monks often lack intellectual curiosity and rigor in their studies.

# Historical Perspectives on Monastic Education

* King Bagidaw, an 18th-century Burmese king, expressed dissatisfaction with the ignorance of priests and called for stricter examinations for those seeking higher positions within the religious hierarchy.

# Rural Influence on Monks

* The rural background and education of monks have shaped their worldview, which resembles that of peasants.
* They share similar beliefs in spirits, demons, miracles, magic, animism, and supernaturalism.

# Political and Social Views

* Monks hold similar political and social views as peasants, lacking sophistication in understanding broader societal forces and changes.
* Their knowledge of geography, astronomy, and biology is also limited.

# Comparison with Other Institutions

* The monkhood contrasts sharply with the army and civil service in terms of recruitment, education, and outlook.
* Army officers are typically urban, middle-class, university-educated, while monks are predominantly rural, lower-class, and have little secular education.

# Exceptions to Generalizations

* While generalizations about the intellectual level of monks hold true in many cases, there are exceptions.
* Some village monks demonstrate deep learning, piety, integrity, and a commitment to Buddhist philosophy.

# Monastic Morality Introduction

* The primary measure of monastic morality is adherence to the Vinaya, the set of regulations governing monastic life.
* These regulations aim to channel non-monastic drives into desirable paths, often different from those followed by lay people.

# Observance of the Vinaya

* Based on observations and interviews, village monks generally adhere closely to the Vinaya.
* Laymen rarely complain about major violations of the Rule, indicating a high level of compliance.




## Sex

* The text explores the adherence of Burmese monks to monastic sexual regulations.
* It highlights the importance of celibacy within Buddhism and the potential consequences for violating this rule.
* Despite the challenges posed by human drives, Burmese monks generally adhere to their vows of chastity.

## Sexual Behavior Among Monks

* While complete certainty about a monk's celibacy is impossible, social pressure and the open nature of monasteries make it difficult for sexual misconduct to remain hidden.
* The author presents a case study of a village monk who engaged in sexual relationships but later underwent a penitential ceremony.
* This case appears to be an exception, as most interviewed monks reported adhering to their vows despite acknowledging the difficulty.

## Reasons for Fidelity

* Burmese monks are motivated by a combination of fear and personal conviction to maintain their celibacy.
* Fear of karmic punishment, expulsion from the Order, and public shaming act as deterrents.
* Some monks genuinely lack interest in sex, while others may struggle with homosexual desires.




## The Occult Arts

* The Vinaya explicitly prohibits Buddhist monks from participating in occult arts, which are considered "low arts."
* These prohibited practices include palmistry, divination, astrology, exorcism, and any form of medical practice.
* Despite the prohibition, many Burmese monks engage in these practices, particularly astrology, medicine, and divination.

## Monastic Practices

* Monks may be consulted for astrological advice on matters like weddings, business losses, illness prognosis, and general failure.
* Some monks specialize in astrology and see numerous clients daily.
* Examples of astrological advice given by monks include dietary restrictions, dates for recovery from illness, discarding old items, avoiding certain individuals, and offering food to birds.

## Healing Arts and Amulets

* Some monks practice medicine as herbalists or exorcists.
* Monks may dispense amulets and spells for protection against dangers like poisonous snakes, witches, and evil spirits.

## Divination

* Monks sometimes use divination techniques to help locate lost items or identify thieves.

## Alchemy

* One-third of the monks in the study either practiced alchemy currently or had done so in the past.
* Motives for practicing alchemy include making gold, acquiring supernatural powers, and achieving longevity.
* Some argue that seeking supermundane power and longevity can be justified as means to spiritual ends like uninterrupted meditation or attaining nirvana through worshipping the future Buddha Metteya.




## The Moral State Of The Sangha

* Burmese monks largely adhere to their monastic rules (Vinaya).
* A significant number of monks violate both the letter and spirit of the Vinaya, creating a public scandal.
* This text distinguishes between "genuine" monks who follow the rules and "bogus" monks who exploit the Order for personal gain.

## The Behavior of Bogus Monks

* Bogus monks engage in various forms of misconduct, including violence, extortion, and worldly pursuits.
* Examples include physical assaults on those who criticize the monkhood, demands for public apologies and feasts, and attendance at movies and theaters.
* Rural monasteries also harbor bogus monks who engage in greed, dishonesty, and exploitation of villagers.

## Historical Perspective on Bogus Monks

* Historical records indicate that complaints about corrupt monks have existed for centuries.
* Early 20th-century surveys revealed widespread dissatisfaction with the behavior of some monks.
* Burmese laymen criticize bogus monks as "humans in yellow robes" and refuse to support them.

## Reasons for Continued Support of Bogus Monks

* Laymen are reluctant to expel monks from their monasteries, even if they engage in sinful behavior.
* They may view the monk's robe as a symbol of sanctity or feel indebted to monks who have been their teachers.
* In cities, where relationships between laymen and monks are less personal, bogus monks may be more easily ignored.

## Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms

* Before British rule, the Burmese monarchy provided mechanisms for policing the monkhood and expelling bogus monks.
* The British abolished these institutions and refused to recognize ecclesiastical law, weakening the Sangha's ability to enforce its rules.

# The Sangha And The State

* Since Independence, the Burmese government has established ecclesiastical courts to try monks accused of violating the Rule.
* These courts are inactive due to fear of reprisal from corrupt monks who control goon squads.
* In villages, there is often no other monk to bring charges against a corrupt monk.
* The government could control the situation through surveillance and registration of monks, but pious monks oppose this for fear of government control.

# Church And State In Early Buddhism

* Classical Buddhist political thought emphasizes an intimate relationship between the state (especially the king) and the Buddhist church. 
* The king is the protector of Buddhism, and Buddhist ideology provides the monarch with charismatic authority.
* This symbiotic relationship between the monastic order and the government dates back to the Asokan period in Indian history.
* Ancient Indian political philosophy recognized diverse social groups, each governed by its own traditional law.
* The government was responsible for protecting these groups, including the Buddhist Order, and preserving their traditional laws.
* In return, the Order acted as the conscience of the government, ensuring it ruled according to Buddhist ethical principles. 




## Church And State In Burmese History Precolonial Burma

* Buddhism was established as the state religion in eleventh-century Pagan.
* The government and monastic Order had a close relationship.
* Although apolitical, the Order influenced the government.
* The government supported the monks with honor, material support, titles, rewards, and elaborate funerals.

##  The Sangha's Influence

* Monks had access to the king and ministers.
* They interceded for prisoners, protected the weak from extortion, assisted in obtaining tax relief, and urged removal of despotic officials.
* They protested against arbitrary land confiscation.

## The Reciprocal Relationship

* The government rewarded monks for their support and reconciliation efforts.
* Monks depended on royal favor for their way of life.
* Kings intervened in monastic affairs, settling disputes and initiating reforms.

## Examples of Royal Intervention

* King Narapatisithu supported the Sinhalese school in the twelfth century.
* King Dhammazeti purged the Order of monks who did not strictly observe the Vinaya in the fifteenth century.
* Four kings intervened in the controversy between the Ekamsikas and Parupanas.
* King Bodapaya resolved the controversy.

## Conclusion

* The relationship between state and Sangha was reciprocal.
* Government support minimized the potential of the Sangha becoming a political power.
* The Sangha restrained excessive abuse of power by the government.

## Colonial Burma

* The British conquest of Upper Burma in 1886 led many monks to become politically active due to the colonial government's lack of support for the Sangha and refusal to recognize Buddhism as a state religion. This disrupted the traditional relationship between church and state, freeing monks from hierarchical constraints and allowing them to engage in political action.

## Buddhist Monks and Anti-British Resistance

* Buddhist monks were actively involved in the resistance movement against British rule following the conquest. While their numbers and motivations are debated, they played a significant role in rebellions between 1885 and 1897.
* Some sources suggest that many of these monastic rebels may have been individuals disguising themselves as monks for political purposes rather than true members of the Sangha.

## Monks and the Independence Movement

* By the early 20th century, Burma had reconciled with British rule until the 1920s and 1930s when the independence movement gained momentum.
* Monks were prominent figures in this movement, often setting the tone for nationalist sentiment by emphasizing the indignities suffered by Buddhism under British rule.

## Monks in the 1930s

* Monks played a key role in two major events of the 1930s: the Saya San rebellion and the 1938 riots against Indians.
* These events were often characterized as spontaneous, but many were planned and led by the Young Monks' Association, a monastic political organization founded in 1938.

## Post-Independence Period

* During the Japanese occupation and the subsequent postwar independence struggle, politically active monks were less influential due to General Aung San's emphasis on a secular state.
* However, the Young Monks' Association regained influence after independence. 




## Church And State In Contemporary Burma

* U Nu, Burma's first prime minister, aimed to strengthen Buddhism through various initiatives like sponsoring pagodas, translating texts, and establishing ecclesiastical courts and Pali universities.
* He also formed the Buddha Sasana Council to promote Buddhism in all aspects.
* In 1962, U Nu declared Buddhism the state religion, which was met with mixed reactions from the Sangha (Buddhist monastic order) and opposition from minority religions.

## The Role of Monks in Politics

* To control the political influence of monks, the constitution prohibited them from voting or holding office.
* Three monastic organizations emerged: the Young Monks' Association (Y.M.A.), the Presiding Abbots Association, and the Younger Monks' Association (Y.A.).
* These organizations influenced legislation and elections, sometimes resorting to violence against those who opposed their views.

## The Young Monks' Association (Y.M.A.)

* Founded in 1938, the Y.M.A. initially focused on national liberation but later became deeply anti-Communist.
* They received funding from the Asia Foundation for anti-Communist activities.
* The Y.M.A. advocated for Buddhism as the state religion and opposed equal rights for other religions.

## The Younger Monks' Association (Y.A.)

* Formed to counter the Y.M.A.'s influence, the Y.A. supported establishing Buddhism as the state religion, ending insurgency, achieving national unity, and combating inflation.
* They were more progressive than the Y.M.A., advocating for social reform, economic development, and democracy.




# The Presiding Abbots' Association

* Government supported organization representing the monastic establishment.
* Politically conservative, focused on advancing Buddhism through government support.
* Opposes Communism and what they see as impious monks.
* Supported U Nu's government but disagreed with granting equal rights to minority religions.

# Political Monks Who Are Not Genuine Members of the Order

* Some monks use their robes for political power or personal gain.
* Few are honest about their motives, often disguising them under Buddhism.
* Exceptions exist, like those focused on social welfare and political reform.

# U Pandita: A Case Study

* Sixty-year-old monk with a history of revolutionary activities.
* Imprisoned for making explosives and counterfeiting money to fund his experiments.
* Believes all governments are evil and justifies his actions as fighting exploitation.

# U Pandita's Religious Beliefs

* Buddhist skeptic who questions the originality of Buddha's teachings.
* Doubts the truth of all religious doctrines due to their unprovability.
* Remains a monk despite his skepticism, believing he upholds the Buddha's call for continuous examination of teachings.

# Discipline and Political Monks

* U Pandita's political activities have not resulted in disciplinary action from the monastic order.
* Many other monks engage in even more flagrant non-monastic behavior without consequences.
* Fear of reprisals prevents local monasteries from disciplining these monks.

# The Abolition of the Primate Office and its Consequences

* The absence of a supreme Primate has contributed to moral decay within the Sangha and its inability to control political monks.
* Thailand, with its Primate and government control over the monkhood, exhibits high monastic discipline and lacks political monks.
* Ceylon, lacking a Primate, mirrors Burma's situation regarding the Sangha's moral status and political involvement.




## The Political Culture Of The Contemporary Burmese Sangha Nonpolitical Monks

* Most monks and laymen oppose monastic involvement in politics.
* They believe the secular and worldly should be separate from the sacred and otherworldly.
* Even social welfare activities are seen as inappropriate for monks.
* Many monks criticize those who participated in the independence movement, viewing it as incompatible with Buddhist principles.

## Political Monks

* There are two types of political monks: those who believe monks should only intervene when Buddhism is threatened, and those who believe monks should be involved in all matters concerning human welfare.
* The first group argues that since governments are no longer pious, monks must protect Buddhism.
* The second group believes monks should emulate the Buddha by working for the welfare of all beings, even if it delays their own enlightenment.
* They argue that political involvement is justified because monks are less susceptible to worldly temptations and can act impartially.

## The Status Of The Monkhood In Burmese Society 




## Veneration Of The Monkhood

* The Order of monks is one of the Three Gems through which salvation is sought in Buddhism.
* Monks are characterized by extraordinary virtues and are worthy of offerings, oblations, gifts, salutations.
* Burmese people venerate monks to a degree unmatched for any other clergy in the world.

## The Monk's Status

* The Burmese term for monk, hpoung:ji:, means "the great glory."
* Monks are addressed as "Sons of the Buddha" and referred to with terms like hpaya: (sacred, holy) or shin-hpaya: (sacred Lord), signifying a supernatural status.
* This distinction is reflected in language used when addressing monks and in everyday interactions.

## Reverence and Privileges

* Laymen use honorific titles when addressing monks, such as dabe.do (your royal disciple).
* Monks refer to themselves as hpoung:ji:ga. or coukka, emphasizing the inferior status of the other person.
* Special language is used when talking about monks, highlighting their elevated status.

* Laymen worship monks by kneeling and touching their forehead to the floor three times.
* Even parents worship their sons who have become monks, reversing the usual hierarchy.
* Monks are superior to kings and gods in terms of merit and receive veneration accordingly.


## Treatment of a Dead Monk

* The funeral of a monk (hpoung:ji: byan) is a grand ceremony involving elaborate preparations and offerings.
* Traditionally, the body was embalmed and displayed in a gilded casket before cremation.
* Dramatic performances and orchestral music were part of the extended mourning period.
* Today, cremation occurs shortly after death, but the mourning period continues with fundraising for the final rites.

* The final rites involve the display of charred bones, offerings, and dramatic performances emphasizing Buddhist themes.
* A large funeral pyre is constructed, and professional mourners wail and chant over the deceased's bones.


# The Final Rites

* Buddhist precepts are offered to laymen.
* Offerings from wishing trees are presented to monks.
* Monks chant two paritta (Mangala Sutta and Metta Sutta).
* Announcement of merit and transfer of merit to the deceased by water libation.
* Public announcement of funds collected for the ceremony.
* Refreshments served to participants.
* Bones interred; famous monks' bones pounded into paste for Buddha image.

# The Veneration of Monks

* K1,180 collected for an undistinguished monk's funeral in a small village (average annual family income: K1,000).
* This exemplifies the immense veneration and wealth offered to monks.
* Crawfurd observed that Burmese prosperity is judged by temple grandeur, not material comforts.
* Monastic offerings reflect both veneration and safe investment due to Burma's insecurity.

# Evidence of Veneration

* People make great sacrifices to build and adorn monasteries for monks.
* A monk in a luxurious monastery lived with his mother who resided in a humble hut after funding its construction.

# The Source of Veneration: Hpoung

* Burmese veneration stems from monks' hpoung (spiritual charisma, glory).
* Hpoung grants monks prestige (goung:) and high social standing.
* Two types of prestige exist: secular/worldly (lo:ki goung:) and religious/otherworldly (lo:kouktara goung:).
* Some prioritize religious prestige above worldly prestige, placing monks at the highest rank.

# Children's Preferences

* Most children (65% out of 9-15 year olds) prefer monastic life over lay life.
* Peasant children overwhelmingly favor monastic life, while non-peasant children show a smaller preference.


# The Case of Weibu Hsaya:do

* Extremely pious monks with special spiritual power attract nationwide veneration.
* Weibu Hsaya:do, abbot of Weibu monastery, travels to cities for devotional meetings.

# Public Alms Rounds

* During alms rounds in Rangoon, crowds gather, causing traffic disruptions.
* The monk walks between rows of faithful, receiving an abundance of gifts.
* Laymen try to touch him, strew flowers on his path, and spread their hair before him.
* Mothers place babies for him to step over.

# Conclusion: Unique Place of Monks

* The extreme obeisance shown to Weibu Hsaya:do highlights the unique reverence reserved for monks.
* A Buddhist myth emphasizes the importance of believing in the Order (monks) for salvation, even more than believing in the Buddha or the Law.

## The Bases For Veneration: Expressive Monastic Asceticism

* Burmese veneration of monks stems from two motives: instrumental value and expressive/symbolic value. This section focuses on the latter.

* Monks are believed to possess "parami," rare qualities acquired through merit accumulated over many lifetimes, enabling them to renounce the world and embrace monastic life.

* Renouncing worldly pleasures, symbolized by the yellow robe, is seen as incredibly difficult for ordinary Burmese.
* The monks' ability to withstand temptations, especially sexual ones, which most Burmese find irresistible, earns them immense respect.

* Many Burmese men have experienced monastic life firsthand but were unable to sustain it due to the difficulty of suppressing their desires.

* This personal experience intensifies their admiration for monks who successfully embrace asceticism.
* The greater the monk's ascetic commitment, the higher their veneration. Conversely, a monk who fails to uphold these standards loses prestige and respect.


* Burmese reverence for monastic renunciation highlights the difference between nibbanic and kammatic Buddhism.

* While nibbanic Buddhism views renunciation as a path to reduced suffering, Burmese kammatic Buddhism sees it as increasing suffering due to the denial of physical pleasure.
* The monk's willingness to endure this suffering for spiritual gain is precisely what earns them veneration in Burmese society.

## Monastic Power

* Monks' ability to withstand temptations and endure ascetic practices is one reason for their veneration by laymen.
* Their alleged superhuman powers, or "miraculous attainments," are another basis for respect.
* All monks are believed to possess some degree of power due to the yellow robe, but certain monks are thought to have extraordinary abilities.

## The Bases For Veneration: Instrumental

* Respect for monastic asceticism and power is not solely expressive; it's also instrumental.
* Alms-giving to monks is seen as a means of acquiring merit, leading to rewards like protection from harm, wealth, and rebirth in heaven.
* The mere existence of a monk provides a "field of merit" for laymen, making monasteries essential in Burmese villages.

* Laymen offer alms even if the monk disapproves of their behavior, as they believe it still earns them merit.
* Children primarily view veneration of monks as a way to acquire merit, while adults also emphasize duty and deserving qualities.
* The lavish support given to monks highlights the donor's focus on personal merit rather than the monks' welfare.

* Monks inadvertently serve as "collective saviors" by enabling laymen to gain merit through alms-giving.
* Monastic offerings are a symmetrical system of exchange, with laymen providing physical needs and monks offering spiritual rewards (merit).
* The purity of the monk is crucial for maximizing merit gained from alms-giving, leading to a preference for ascetic monks.

## The Instrumental Concern of Burmese Buddhists with Monastic Purity

* Laymen believe monks should follow Vinaya regulations primarily because it benefits them, allowing them to acquire merit through alms-giving.
* Some laymen express a conditional support for monks, stating they will only provide food if the monks adhere to the rules.
* Only a few laymen and monks themselves view monastic discipline as essential for destroying desire, facilitating meditation, and promoting Buddhism.

## Ambivalence And Hostility To The Monkhood

* Despite reverence for monks, Burmese laymen also express resentment towards them.
* Monks are criticized for being narcissistic and inconvenient, often demanding assistance without considering the layman's circumstances.
* Laymen suggest that treating monks as semi-divine beings while they live in luxury can breed ambivalence.
* Folk sayings and riddles highlight the tension between respect and criticism directed at monks.

* Some laymen argue that they are as pious as monks, emphasizing the importance of personal practice over monastic status.
* They claim that anyone can achieve nirvana through meditation, regardless of whether they wear a robe or not.




## Conflict Between Laymen And Monks

* Burmese Buddhists, despite their veneration for monks, sometimes experience tension and conflict with them due to factionalism within villages and monasteries.
* Conflicts often arise when monks side with one lay faction or vice versa, leading to accusations of immorality and withholding of alms.
* Reciprocity is a key element in the monk-layman relationship; when this breaks down, conflict can ensue.

## Buddhism And The World: A Critique

* This section is not summarized as it appears to be a heading for a new chapter or topic. 




## The Problem

* Man's experience in society shapes his personality and influences his acceptance or rejection of religious doctrines.
* Religion can also act as an independent variable, influencing the society it is embedded in.

## 425

* Social scientists often study religion's influence on social institutions but struggle to demonstrate concrete causal relationships.
* Scholars sometimes attribute Asian societal characteristics (caste, poverty, conservatism) to Hinduism and Buddhism without sufficient evidence.
* Two flawed arguments are common:
    * Deduction from normative religious doctrines to infer population behavior, ignoring the possibility of non-internalization or the presence of other religions.
    * Assuming causality between coexisting religious and social variables without considering alternative explanations (reverse causation, no causation, or a third variable).

## Nibbanic Buddhism And The World

* Weber argued that certain doctrinal characteristics of Buddhism are inimical to worldly action.
* Assurance of salvation in Buddhism is sought through a psychic state remote from activity, not through any inner-worldly or extra-worldly action.
* Salvation is an absolutely personal performance of the self-reliant individual.

## Nibbanic Buddhism and Worldly Action

* Nibbanic Buddhism teaches that all life entails suffering, and surcease from suffering can never be achieved in the world of rebirth.
* No form of secular behavior can bring the individual to nirvana; it can only be achieved through meditation in retreat from the world.
* Involvement in the world is religiously perilous, even moral behavior is an obstacle to salvation as it leads to the accumulation of merit and karma.

## The Buddhist Trinity and Worldly Renunciation

* The Buddha represents passivity and renunciation, not activity.
* He teaches the Way to redemption but does not redeem; His Way is the way of worldly renunciation.
* The imitation of the Buddha can only lead to retreat from and renunciation of the world.

## The Monastic Order and Worldly Renunciation

* The monastic order exemplifies the world-renunciatory orientation of Buddhism.
* Although it is not absolutely necessary to become a monk, the chances of attaining liberation as a layman are exceedingly remote.
* The lay community's chief responsibility is to support and provide for the monastic order.

## Soteriological Action and Worldly Action

* Nibbanic salvation is salvation through knowledge, not through works.
* Morality is demanded as a way station en route to soteriological knowledge but it is neither a means nor a sign of salvation.
* Assurance of one's own chance of salvation cannot be found in any type of action; neither in work, nor in art, nor in politics.

## Asokan Buddhism: A Bridge Between Buddhism and the World?

* Some Buddhists attempt to forge a bridge between Buddhism and the world by arguing that certain social conditions are more conducive than others to attaining detachment.
* This application of nibbanic Buddhism to the world is labeled "Asokan Buddhism."
* However, Asokan Buddhism has had little influence on Buddhist history and society.

## Conclusion

* While some Buddhists attempt to relate their concern for the world to the quest for nirvana, essentially nibbanic Buddhism does not articulate with the world.

## War

* All monks and most laymen said that Buddhism disapproves of war, even in self-defense.
* They believe killing is never acceptable.
* However, if Burma were attacked, they would fight.
* Monks stated defense of one's country is a worldly matter, not a Buddhist concern.

## Buddhism and Social Issues

* The sample agreed that Buddhism supports good hospitals, schools, racial equality, and democracy.
* They disagreed with the idea of a classless society, believing karma determines social standing.
* Most laymen believed Burmese people were superior to hill tribes due to their Buddhist faith.

## Weber's Interpretation of Buddhism

* Weber argued that Buddhism does not provide a bridge to the world because worldly action is not seen as a means to salvation.
* This argument is correct for nibbanic Buddhism, but kammatic Buddhism, which focuses on karma and rebirth, may have a different impact on society.

## Buddhist Influence on Burmese Society

* Some writers argue that Buddhist monasticism promotes democracy by treating all people equally.
* However, there's no evidence to support this claim, as dramatic status differences exist in Burmese society despite monastic egalitarianism.
* Others attribute Burma's supposed democracy and high status of women to Buddhism.
* These claims are also unsupported, as other Buddhist societies have low female status and Burma has never been a true democracy.

## Karma and Behavior

* Some argue that the belief in karma leads to Burmese indifference towards suffering.
* They claim that since suffering is seen as karmic retribution, alleviating it is pointless.
* However, this argument lacks evidence and ignores other factors influencing Burmese behavior.
* The Burmese themselves rarely attribute their actions to karma, and Buddhist teachings emphasize compassion and helping those in need.

## Karma and Fatalism

* Popular belief associates Buddhism with fatalism due to the concept of karma.
* However, Burmese Buddhism distinguishes between present and future karma.
* Future karma is shaped by present actions, giving individuals agency over their destiny.
* This understanding contradicts the idea of a predetermined fate controlled by external forces.

# The Intention Of The Present Analysis

* This analysis aims to explore the influence of religion on the world, following Max Weber's framework.
* It focuses on how religious conceptions of salvation motivate action in the world, either towards achieving salvation or proving one's saved status.
*  It also considers unintended consequences of religious beliefs on social institutions.
* The analysis will examine three aspects of Buddhism: affiliation, soteriology (conceptions of salvation), and Weltanschauung (worldview).

# Buddhism And Burmese Society

* This section examines the influence of Buddhism on Burmese society.
* It focuses on how certain Buddhist doctrines, like karma and merit, are integrated into Burmese social thought and practices. 
* The analysis will explore how these concepts shape the Burmese understanding of time, particularly in relation to rebirth.




## Karma And The Moral Authority Of The Social Order

* Since societies have unequal distribution of goods (power, wealth, etc.), their persistence depends on people believing they are receiving a fair share. 
* This belief is tied to the moral authority of the distributional system and how inequalities are perceived.
* Those who feel they lack a fair share can be a source of change: structural (changing the system itself) or positional (seeking a greater share within the existing system).

## The Doctrine of Karma as Moral Authority

* Karma, with its promise of future rewards for good deeds and explanations for present status based on past actions, provides moral authority to any social order.
* It justifies inequalities by presenting them as karmic consequences of merit or demerit accumulated in past lives.
* This perspective suggests that everyone receives what they deserve, even if it appears unfair in a single lifetime.

## Paradoxical Consequences for Burmese Political and Social Orders

* Karma's role in the political system is paradoxical: it legitimizes the ruling regime while also providing justification for overthrowing it.
* Belief in karma can stabilize a regime by viewing its leader as deserving of power due to past merit. 
* However, this same belief can fuel rebellion because any ruler, even a despotic one, is seen as reaping karmic rewards from past lives.

## Karma and Political Change

* While Hindu dharma discourages positional change, Buddhism allows for it based on present effort and wisdom, albeit within the limits set by past karma.
* This uncertainty about karmic trajectories can lead to ambition and attempts to usurp power, with individuals believing their time has come.
* Usurpers may try to counteract negative karma through acts of merit like building monasteries or pagodas.

## Legitimacy of New Regimes

* The same karmic logic that justifies a ruler's downfall also legitimizes the new regime.
* A successful seizure of power is seen as evidence that the previous ruler's karmic fruit has run out and the usurper's karma has come to fruition.
* The methods used to gain power do not affect the karmic legitimacy of the new regime; success itself validates its rule.

# The Paradoxical Role of Karma in Politics

* The doctrine of karma is both conservative and revolutionary in politics.
* It legitimizes any political regime, leading to instability when power transitions are frequent.
* Burmese culture, with its ambivalence towards power, exemplifies this instability.

# Social Stability

* Karma justifies socioeconomic inequality by attributing wealth to past merit.
* The poor accept their poverty as karmic retribution, avoiding resentment towards the rich.
* This belief reinforces the status quo and discourages social change.

# Karma and Economic Mobility

* While karma doesn't prevent individual economic advancement, it discourages large-scale socioeconomic upheaval.
* Wealth accumulation is seen as virtuous, reinforcing the prestige of the wealthy.
* The poor focus on improving their karma in future lives rather than challenging the existing system.




## Cosmology And Social Control

* The belief in karma and rebirth are powerful motivators for moral behavior in Burma.
* Burmese people fear being reborn in hell and this fear acts as a deterrent to immoral actions. 
* While the fear of hell is a strong deterrent, some individuals rationalize violating Buddhist precepts due to their past sins or perceived necessity.

## The Doctrine Of Karma And Social Inequality

* The doctrine of karma is used by both rich and poor to justify their respective social positions.
* Poor villagers often attribute their poverty to bad karma, while wealthy individuals attribute their success to good karma.
* This differential use of the karma doctrine reinforces existing social hierarchies.




# The Doctrine Of Rebirth And Oedipal Tensions
* The belief in rebirth can help resolve Oedipal conflicts by allowing individuals to see themselves as both their own father and son.
* This can lead to a denial of the biological father and the act of parental intercourse, thus muting Oedipal hostility.

# Temporal Orientation And Ambition
* Buddhism has a vast time scale, with rebirths spanning incredible durations.
* Burmese people often believe that if they don't achieve something in this life, they will have another chance in their next rebirth. This can lead to resignation and a lack of ambition.

# Buddhist Soteriology And The Burmese Economy Introduction
* Kammatic Buddhism, unlike nibbanic Buddhism, encourages worldly activity as a means to soteriological action.
* Economic success is seen as necessary for achieving salvation, which in turn has positive social and economic consequences.

## Kammatic Salvation And Economic Motivation

* **Kammatic Salvation And Economic Motivation**
    * Burmese Buddhism believes satisfying cravings leads to release from suffering, unlike nibbanic Buddhism.
    * Their goal is not ending rebirth but achieving pleasurable rebirths through good karma.
    * Merit accumulation is crucial for good karma and thus a central focus.

* **Worldly Action And Salvation**
    * Unlike nibbanic Buddhism, kammatic Buddhism sees worldly action as neutral to salvation.
    * Salvation comes from merit, not worldly actions.
    * However, economic activity indirectly supports salvation by enabling giving (dana), the most valuable form of merit acquisition.

* **Wealth As Proof And Motive**
    * Wealth itself is proof of past merit and future good rebirths.
    * Giving wealth for dana further increases merit and chances of favorable rebirth.
    * This creates a powerful economic motive, similar to the Calvinist drive.

* **Dana: Merit, Prestige, And Economic Activity**
    * Dana (giving) is not only crucial for merit but also for prestige in Burmese society.
    * Public displays of dana through sponsoring ceremonies and building religious structures bring social recognition.
    * This dual motivation of merit and prestige further drives economic activity to accumulate wealth for dana.

* **Motivational Overdetermination Of Dana**


    * The combination of merit and prestige in dana is understandable given Buddhism's cultural importance and the significance of prestige in Burmese society.
    * Regardless of the motivation, dana requires financial resources, providing a strong incentive for work and saving.

## Dana And Economic Development

* The pursuit of salvation through dana motivates economic activity (work and saving) while also having significant economic consequences.
* Burmese families invest a substantial portion of their income in dana, highlighting the importance of salvation but also impacting the economy and society.

## Economic Growth

* The initiation ceremony is the most important Buddhist ceremony, requiring significant dana investments ranging from K200 to K10,000 or more.
* Expenses are covered through savings, property sales, and loans, with some recovery through contributions from guests who also gain merit.
* Kahteing ceremonies involve collective offerings of robes to monks, costing around K4,200 on average but potentially reaching K10,000.

## Monk's Funeral (hpoung:ji: byan)

* Monk funerals can be costly, with expenses ranging from K2,000 for simple ceremonies in small villages to astronomical sums like K800,000 for a funeral in Mogok.
* Layman funerals also involve dana offerings to monks, costing around K250 on average.


## Other Offerings

* Regular daily alms food and special meals for monks consume about 10% of the average family's income.
* Construction and repair of pagodas and monasteries are significant sources of merit, with emissaries from other villages collecting funds regularly.

* Wealthy individuals may construct their own monasteries, costing tens of thousands of Kyat.

* Offerings to Buddha statues and pagodas, especially at famous pilgrimage sites, also contribute to dana expenses.

## Total Investment in Dana

* The total investment in dana in one Upper Burmese village in 1961 was K42,000 (approximately $9,000), excluding special meals, construction projects, pilgrimages, and contributions to emissaries.

## Table 16

* This table shows the annual normal expenditure on Buddhism in one village in Upper Burma in 1961.
* The total expenditure was K41,800.

## Wealthy Villagers and Religious Giving

* Wealthy villagers spend more on religious giving than less fortunate people.
* An example is given of a wealthy person who spent K2,210 in 1961 on religious activities.
* Another example is given of a wealthy villager who incurred significant expenses for his son's initiation ceremony and other religious activities over several years.

## The Economic Impact of Buddhism

* It is estimated that Upper Burmese villages spend 30 to 40 percent of their net disposable income on dana (religious giving) and related activities.
* This suggests that the economy of rural Burma is geared towards accumulating wealth for merit.

## Buddhist Soteriology and Economic Action

* For Buddhists, pursuing salvation provides a powerful motivation for economic action.
* Unlike Puritanism, which encourages reinvestment of wealth to demonstrate election, Buddhism emphasizes dana (giving) as a means to enhance chances of salvation.
* This difference in soteriology leads to different motivations regarding savings.

## Merit-Through-Dana and Economic Growth

* The Buddhist emphasis on merit through dana has ironic consequences for economic growth in Burma.
* While Puritans disdained worldly pleasures, Buddhists view them as a boon to be enjoyed.
* By channeling savings into dana instead of economic investment, Burmese Buddhists defer present joys for the hope of pleasurable rebirth.
* This pattern has hindered economic development and growth in Burma.

## Rationality of Dana

* For individual Burmese, the merit-through-dana pattern is rational because its consequences are not dysfunctional from their perspective.
* The returns from dana are seen as immense (leading to greater wealth and pleasure in a future rebirth) and risk-free due to the law of karma.
* Dana also provides immediate benefits such as prestige and material pleasure.

## Economic Investments and Risks

* Economic investments, on the other hand, are seen as neither very profitable nor sound.
* The small savings of the average peasant would not yield significant returns in the present.
* There is also a risk associated with investment due to Burma's history of unrest, dacoity, insurgency, and warfare.

## Historical Context

* Throughout Burmese history, government confiscation of private wealth has discouraged saving and investment.
* Sumptuary laws have also limited the enhancement of one's lifestyle in their present status.
* As a result, savings have been channeled into religion, as evidenced by the prevalence of religious structures compared to other types of buildings.

## Social Services

* The belief in merit acquired through dana (giving) has significant consequences for social services in Buddhist societies.
* Burmese believe merit is proportional to the sanctity of the recipient, favoring religious contributions over secular ones.
* This leads to limited support for secular activities like education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
* Examples include insufficient funding for schools and hospitals compared to monasteries.

## The Impact on Society

* The focus on religious giving hinders economic development and social progress.
* Burmese society could benefit from allocating more resources to secular needs.
* Some Burmese recognize the need for change but are unable to shift the prevailing attitude.




# Lest it be objected that perhaps the lack of support in Burma for hospitals, schools, and so on more validly reflects an attitude of indifference to such services

* Burmese people desire hospitals, schools, and other services but believe the government is responsible for providing them.
* Villagers see the government as wealthy and capable of funding these services, attributing any lack thereof to corruption and inefficiency.

# In short, from the villagers' point of view, the products of economic development can and must be achieved by government, independent of the people—i.e., themselves—who are governed. Their own action with respect to such ends is both irrelevant and unnecessary. The ends to which their efforts are more properly devoted are religious—religious development, if you will—and few of them appreciate the fact that the more they invest in religion, the fewer are the resources available to the government for developmental projects and goals

* Villagers believe economic development is solely the government's responsibility, not theirs.
* They prioritize religious development over contributing to societal progress.

# Lest the thrust of this argument be misunderstood, I must emphasize again that the mere existence of Buddhism as an official religion does not in itself have the consequences I have outlined here

* The described social and economic consequences stem from the internalization of specific Buddhist doctrines, not simply the religion's presence.
* Weakening these doctrines would dismantle the motivational structure leading to these outcomes.

# In contemporary Burma there are certainly some Buddhists for whom the doctrinal set and its motivational consequence are weak; these form the small group of entrepreneurs in Burmese society (or at least they did, before the present government abolished private property). In contemporary Thailand, which is undergoing rapid economic development, one has the impression that Buddhism in any of its soteriological guises is worn more loosely, at least by the modernizers

* Some Buddhists, particularly entrepreneurs, exhibit weaker adherence to these doctrines.
* Modernizing societies like Thailand show a loosening grip on traditional Buddhist beliefs among their elites.

# The modern elite, however, still intoxicated with the prospects of industrialization, may be expected instead to choose immediate satisfactions over satisfactions deferred

* The allure of immediate gratification through industrial progress may overshadow long-term religious rewards for the modern elite.
* This preference for present satisfaction might lead to a decline in traditional Buddhist practices among this group. 




## Buddhist Affiliation And Burmese Social Integration Buddhist Action And Social Cooperation
* Buddhist rituals, often performed collectively, physically integrate participants at various social levels. 
* These ceremonies foster cooperation and reciprocity, creating a temporary sense of unity that transcends factionalism.
* While Buddhism can contribute to factionalism, it also provides a platform for reconciliation and outward displays of goodwill.

## The Buddhist Heritage And Social Solidarity
* Buddhism is central to Burmese ethnic identity, serving as the primary basis for mutual identification and solidarity.
* It has historically unified diverse ethnic groups under one religious banner.
* This shared identity is associated with positive feelings of pride, stemming from the perceived greatness of Buddhism and its connection to Burmese historical glories. 
* Buddhist ceremonies often incorporate elements of royalty and nobility, allowing even peasants to experience a sense of grandeur.
* Being affiliated with the Buddhist church signifies acceptance of Buddhist beliefs and values, which have significant social consequences.

## The Buddhist Monk And Group Identification

* The status of the Buddhist monk is pivotal in Buddhist society, and their role is central to Buddhist thought and behavior. 
* Burmese society revolves around the care and provision for monks, with ceremonies primarily focused on feeding and offering robes to them.
* This focus on monks is not due to their intrinsic importance but rather their instrumental and expressive value.

* Monks symbolize renunciation, representing the rejection of the worldly for the otherworldly.
* Although Burmese laymen cannot abandon the world themselves, they venerate monks as symbols of this ideal.
* The monk serves as a living example and model of what the Burmese values most, even if unattainable.

* Without exemplary monks embodying the ideal, Buddhism itself could perish. 
* The monk is crucial for the Burmese conception of themselves, providing a model for their otherworldly aspirations.

* Burmese culture values prestige, charismatic power, and authority, all worldly concepts that Buddhism rejects.
* This tension between worldly desires and otherworldly ideals highlights the importance of the monk as a symbol.
* Burmese revere monks because they embody the ego ideal they cannot live up to themselves.
* Through their reverence for this shared symbol, Burmese identify with each other, achieving social integration.

# The Phongyies

* The Phongyies are admired for their religious devotion and separation from worldly life.
* They are seen as imitators of Buddha and living examples of religious perfection.
* Their austere lifestyle and rejection of sensual pleasures set them apart and earn them respect.
