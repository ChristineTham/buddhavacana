# About This Volume

* This volume is an in-depth study of rDzogs-chen mKhan-po gZhan-dga', a representative of the nonsectarian movement in Eastern Tibet.
* The author combines fieldwork and analysis of original sources to present both the spiritual and mundane aspects of gZhan-dga's life and work.

* gZhan-dga' was known for founding institutes for Buddhist higher learning, establishing academies throughout the Tibetan Buddhist world.
* He faced many challenges, including political turmoil in the disputed kingdoms between the Tibetan plateau and the Chinese lowlands.
* gZhan-dga' was accused of intellectualism but remained a practitioner and teacher of meditation.

* His close reading of Indian texts led to a reformist view of emptiness, critical of more recent Tibetan interpretations.
* He grappled with questions of intellectual freedom, anti-intellectualism, historicity, elitism, and polemics.

# Mkhan-Po Gzhan-Dga' And His Time1

* A nomad lama arrived at a wealthy encampment seeking shelter.
* Buddhism played a significant role in promoting literacy and higher education in pre-modern Asia.
* Buddhist monastic orders brought literacy to Japan, Tibet, and Mongolia.
* Literacy did not reach remote areas of Tibet for over a thousand years after the founding of bSam-yas Monastery.

# Monastic Education in Central Tibet

* After 1642, dGe-lugs-pa monasteries expanded, offering intense scholastic training centered on monastic debate.
* Graduates often served in government positions due to their education in logic and debate.
* Non-dGe-lugs-pa traditions had their own scholarly centers, flourishing outside Central Tibetan government control.

# The Kingdom of SDe-dge

* sDe-dge was home to monasteries of mainly the Saskya, rNying-ma, and bKa'-brgyud traditions.
* Si-tu Paṇ-chen Choskyi-'byung-gnas (ca. 1700–1774) was a brilliant scholar from dPal-spungs monastery.
* The kingdom experienced sectarian strife, with the Saskya-pa ousting a rNying-ma faction from the palace monastery in 1798.

# The Ris-Med Movement

* mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po (1820–1892), a Sa-skya dignitary, contributed to dialogue between various religious traditions in sDe-dge.
* He studied rNying-ma doctrines and lived with the founders of the Ris-med movement: rDza dPal-sprul, 'Jam-mgon Kong-sprul, and mChog-gyur-gling-pa.

# The Need for Higher Education Institutions

* After the passing of the Ris-med founders, there was a lack of institutions providing systematic higher education.
* dPal-spungs Monastery, despite housing brilliant scholars like Si-tu Paṇ-chen and Kong-sprul, lacked a structured teaching system.

# rDzogs-Chen Monastery's Śrī-Siṃha College

* The rNying-ma monastery of rDzogs-chen established the Śrī-Siṃha college in the mid-nineteenth century.
* dPal-sprul taught there briefly but left due to a lack of discipline.


# Mkhan-Po Gzhan-Dga' and His Legacy

* mKhan-po gZhan-dga' (1871–1927) emerged as a successor to the first Ris-med generation.
* He organized highly structured colleges with strict monastic discipline and devised a systematic curriculum for Buddhist higher education.
* His *Gloss Commentaries on the Thirteen Great Texts* served as textbooks for his curriculum.

# Explanation Colleges vs. Debating Colleges

* gZhan-dga's "explanation colleges" (*bshad grwa*) contrasted with dGe-lugs-pa "debating colleges" (*rtsod grwa*).
* While debate was central to dGe-lugs-pa education, gZhan-dga' emphasized direct explanation of original texts.

# The Teaching Method

* In gZhan-dga's colleges, students learned through morning explanations by the master teacher, afternoon discussions with tutors, and independent review.
* Students took turns assuming the role of teacher to explain material to the class.




# Aim And Method Of This Study

* The subject of this study, mKhan-po gZhan-dga', did not want his biography written.
* Despite this, several accounts of his life have been written, increasing in length over time.
* This study is not a traditional Tibetan "complete-liberation" (*rnam thar*) biography, which focuses only on positive aspects.

* Instead, it aims for a critical and non-judgmental understanding of gZhan-dga's motives and actions.
* It acknowledges that historical agents acted according to their context and beliefs.
* The study relies heavily on *rnam-thar* sources but critically evaluates them, especially regarding potentially negative events.

# Acknowledgements

* The author expresses deep gratitude to his advisor, Professor David Jackson, for his continuous support and expertise.
* He thanks various Tibetan scholars and monks who provided valuable information and insights.
* Other individuals and institutions are acknowledged for their contributions and support.

## Chapter 2: An Inquiry Into Gzhan-Dga'S Life

* Our inquiry into gZhan-dga's life cannot be a simple linear narrative due to the nature of available sources.
* Narrative episodes are neither fully verifiable nor preserved in a clear temporal sequence.
* The narrative presented is a *possible* sequence of events or a collection of sources for reflection and inquiry.

## 1. Childhood And Youth

* gZhan-dga' was born in the "Rainbow Plain" ('Ja'-thang), near Yongs-gsar in 1871.
* 'Ja'-thang belonged to sGa-pa, a district of Nangchen administrated from the city of sKye-dgu-mdo.

## Birth Into The Rgya-Kong Family

* gZhan-dga' was born into the rGya-kong dPon-tshang, a wealthy family that supplied the local ruler over about seven hundred nomad families in Kha-na.
* His father, rGya-kong dPon dKon-mchog-rnam-rgyal, sponsored all four main traditions present in the area: Sa-skya, dGe-lugs, bKa'-brgyud and rNying-ma.
* gZhan-dga's original name was Phan-bde-rnam-rgyal.
* His father wanted him to be the next chief, but gZhan-dga' showed little interest in founding a family.
* He had at least two younger brothers: rNam-grol and the fifth rDzogs-chen dPon-slob Rin-po-che.

## Leaving Home

* This is a time to distance oneself from friends and enemies, ignore plans, and disregard opinions.
* It's a time to make independent decisions and escape like a trapped animal seeking freedom.
* rDza dPal-sprul grew up in a nomadic tribe where tradition and tribal leaders governed daily life.

## Meeting Rdza Dpal-Sprul Rin-Po-Che

*  rGya-kong Phan-bde, short on supplies, traveled to meet the renowned Ris-med master rDza dPal-sprul.
* dPal-sprul was a living legend known for his extraordinary abilities and teachings.
* Phan-bde's decision to leave home without provisions mirrored dPal-sprul's own wandering lifestyle.

## Rdza Dpal-Sprul: Scholar, Mystic, Vagabond

* dPal-sprul dissolved the possessions of the dPal-dge *bla brang* after its former leader's brother passed away.
* He studied at Zhe-chen monastery where he impressed mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po and Kong-sprul with his photographic memory of Buddhist teachings.
* dPal-sprul became a teacher at rDzogs-chen Monastery but left due to the lax morals of some monks.
* He retreated to the dGe-mang mountain, close to his homeland.
* dPal-sprul was known for traveling incognito, dressed as a poor monk or layman.
* His teachings were said to spread like the roar of snow lions. 
* He particularly admired the *Bodhicaryāvatāra*.




## Phan-Bde Follows Rdza Dpal-Sprul'S Example

* rDza dPal-sprul's life influenced Phan-bde's career path.
* Phan-bde would later renovate Śrī-Siṃha college and enforce strict Vinaya observance, fulfilling gZhan-phan-mtha'-yas' vision.
* Like dPal-sprul, he made the Bodhicaryāvatāra central to his teachings and retired early to a mountain retreat.

## Arrival In Dge-Mang And Novice Ordination

* Phan-bde met rDza dPal-sprul who gave him a letter of recommendation to O-rgyan-bstan-'dzin-norbu at dGe-mang monastery.

* Blo-gter-dbang-po's teachings were not detailed due to his responsibilities.
* gZhan-dga's tutoring was also limited as he wasn't raised in the tradition of new tantras.

* A-'jam Rin-po-che relied on sGa-ston for further understanding of Sa-skya commentaries.

## Invitation To Teach At Dpal-Spungs: Historical Background

* gZhan-dga's next destination was dPal-spungs Thub-bstan-chos-'khor-gling, a Karma bKa'-brgyud monastery.
* It was one of the largest monasteries in sDe-dge kingdom and held significant estates.
* Founded by the eighth Tā'i-si-tu-pa in 1729, dPal-spungs became the most important Karma bKa'-brgyud monastery outside Central Tibet.

* This shift was due to political reasons, allowing Si-tu Paṇ-chen to escape Central Tibetan interference and taxation.
*  dPal-spungs' importance elevated Si-tu Paṇ-chen's status, making him second only to the Karma-pa in the tradition.

## Mkhan-Chen Bkra-Shis-'Od-Zer Invites Gzhan-Dga'

## Founding Dpal-Spungs Bshad-Grwa And Instructing Si-Tu

* gZhan-dga' arrived at dPal-spungs in 1910 and established a thriving college (*bshad grwa*) for Buddhist studies.

## The Dpal-Spungs Dkor-Bdag

* bKra-shis-'od-zer, a strict follower of the Vinaya, had advised the Si-tu not to make offerings to worldly deities, including the dPal-spungs dKor-bdag, a protective spirit of the monastery.
* gZhan-dga', however, told the Si-tu that the dKor-bdag had complained about not receiving any offerings from him.
* As a result, the Si-tu began making annual offerings to the dKor-bdag, balancing his respect for both teachers' instructions.

## Frictions At Dpal-Spungs: Gzhan-Dga'S Critique Of Gzhan-Stong

## Mention Of The Conflict By Stobs-Dga' G.Yul-Rgyal

* sTobs-dga' g.Yul-rgyal's history of the Karma bKa'-brgyud lineage mentions a rift between gZhan-dga' and Kong-sprul, possibly due to a broken tantric bond.

## A Letter By The Fifteenth Karma-Pa

* A letter written by the 15th Karma-pa to Be-ri mKhyen-brtse warns against gZhan-dga's teachings, comparing them to a "pika with a big mouth."
* This metaphor implies that gZhan-dga's teachings were seen as superficial, lacking depth and meditative experience.

## The Metaphor Of The Hungry Abra

* The pika is a small mammal considered a pest in Tibetan culture, known for competing with livestock for resources and causing damage.
* Calling someone a "pika with a big mouth" suggests they are talkative, boastful, and lack substance.
* This metaphor reflects the bKa'-brgyud-pa's emphasis on meditative practice over scholasticism.

## Authenticity Of The Letter

* Some doubt the authenticity of the Karma-pa's letter, as it was transcribed by his secretary.
* Attempts to verify its contents with the Karma-pa were unsuccessful due to his death in 1922.

## Kar-Sras Kong-Sprul'S Studies Under Gser-Kha Chos-Grags

## From Dil-Mgo Mkhyen-Brtse'S Memoirs

* Towards the end of his life, gZhan-dga' did not teach the "Empty-of-Other" view.
* He believed that holding this view was worse than having bad karma from being a hunter.
* Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse received instructions on Madhyamaka treatises from gZhan-dga'.

## Instigating A Discussion

*  A misunderstanding in the classroom may have caused friction between gZhan-dga' and some students.

* gTer-ston Nyi-ma-grags-pa, a close associate of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, was not well liked by the Karma bKa'-brgyud-pa.
* Some monks in dPal-spungs may have viewed gZhan-dga's stance against gZhan-stong as evidence of dGe-lugs-pa leanings.

## Bstan-Dga' Rin-Po-Che On Views And Persons

* Ban-sprul bsTan-'dzin Rin-po-che cautioned against confusing gZhan-dga's critique of gZhan-stong with a personal attack on its proponents.
* Despite criticizing the gZhan-stong view, gZhan-dga' never said anything disrespectful about Kong-sprul or Tāranātha.

## Rgyal-Rong Bstan-'Dzin-Grags-Pa'S Critique Of Kong-Sprul

* rGyal-rong bsTan-'dzin-grags-pa was a critic of Kong-sprul, particularly his inclusion of Bon-po *gter* mas in the Rin chen gter mdzod.
* He might have been motivated by the history of interreligious conflict in rGyal-rong, a hotspot of Bon-po activity.

## The Rang-stong–gZhan-stong Debate and mKhan-po gZhan-dga's Standpoint

* gZhan-dga' was critical of the philosophical tradition known as gZhan-stong.
* He quoted a "Later Omniscient One," likely Klong-chen-pa or Go-rams-pa bSod-nams-sengge, who rejected the gZhan-stong view.
* gZhan-dga' aligned himself with Candrakīrti's tradition and defined Madhyamaka as emphasizing the void nature of conditioned phenomena.

* While gZhan-dga' seemed to oppose gZhan-stong, there might be more nuance to his position.
* Figures like Go-rams-pa and Mi-pham acknowledged Yogācāra tenets while also aligning with Madhyamaka views on ultimate truth.
* This suggests potential overlap between Kong-sprul's gZhan-stong and gZhan-dga''s views, beyond mere wording differences.

* gZhan-dga' revered Candrakīrti but ultimately aimed for the realization of the *dharmakāya*.
* He praised Candrakīrti's understanding of emptiness and tathātā.
* While he opposed Bu-ston's view on Rangbrgyud and Thal-'gyur traditions, he acknowledged Klong-chen-pa's acceptance of Candrakīrti's interpretation.

* gZhan-dga''s writings contain affirmative statements about dharmatā and the *dharmakāya*, suggesting a complex relationship with gZhan-stong.
* He criticized those who confused the *tathāgatagarbha* with external concepts or equated emptiness with annihilation.

* mKhan-po Chos-dga' noted that gZhan-dga''s position didn't fit neatly into Rang-stong or gZhan-stong categories.
* gZhan-dga' likely shared views with Rong-zom and Klong-chen-pa, who emphasized the *Guhyagarbha* as a key tenet.

# Mi-pham's Views on Emptiness and the Ris-med Movement
* Mi-pham viewed emptiness as the unconditioned, pure nature of reality where buddhahood is possible.
* He saw Klong-chen-pa's views as a bridge between Rang-stong and gZhan-stong traditions.

# gZhan-dga' and gZhan-stong Views
* There was tension between gZhan-dga' and the gZhan-stong view, with some of his students criticizing it while others remained sympathetic.
* Padma-rnam-rgyal, a student of gZhan-dga', argued that Si-tu Paṇ-chen's gZhan-stong position was moderate and compatible with Rang-stong on an ultimate level.

# Reunion With Mkhyen-Brtse Chos-Kyi-Blo-Gros At The Royal Palace
* In 1917, a royal function at the palace in sDe-dge dGon-chen brought together dignitaries from across the kingdom.
* gZhan-dga' attended as part of dPal-spungs Monastery's delegation and met mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros again.

# Invitation to Teach at rDzong-gsar
* mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros invited gZhan-dga' to teach at his newly founded *bshad grwa* near rDzong-gsar Monastery.
* gZhan-dga' accepted but planned to stay at dPal-spungs for another year before joining.
* Kaḥ-thog Si-tu, mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros's mentor, advised him to invite gZhan-dga', despite knowing of his reservations about gZhan-stong.

## Historical Background Of The Khams-Bye Bshad-Grwa

* **gZhan-dga''s Arrival at rDzong-gsar:** gZhan-dga' moved from dPal-spungs to rDzong-gsar, the seat of mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po, a prominent Ris-med luminary.
* **rDzong-gsar Monastery:** Founded by Sa-skya Paṇḍita's nephew, it was affiliated with Ngor Monastery in Central Tibet. Though not officially listed as providing royal chaplains for the House of sDedge, mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po became a highly influential Buddhist dignitary.
* **mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po:** Born into the influential gTer-lung Dil-mgo family, he was known for his physical resemblance to other members of his family and his extraordinary height and large eyes. Recognized as the reincarnation of a revered mkhan chen of Ngor, he studied at sMin-grol-gling monastery before returning to sDe-dge.
* **Scholarly Achievements and Political Influence:** mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po was an accomplished scholar who preserved Tibetan Buddhist texts. During the Nyag-rong war, he played a crucial role in resisting invaders and became a trusted advisor to the lHa-sa authorities.

* **Establishment of Khams-bye Bshad-Grwa:** mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po established Khams-bye Bshad-Grwa ("The Garden where Teaching and Accomplishment Spread, The Temple of the Manifestations of the [Lords of] The Three Families in the Sandy Plain of Khams") as part of his estate. He believed this temple was needed to counteract the three defilements prevalent in the area.

* **Succession Struggle:** After mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po's death, a succession struggle arose between two parties associated with young reincarnations (*sprul sku*s). One *sprul sku*, appointed by Blo-gter-dbang-po and Ngor authorities, resided at rDzong-gsar bKra-shis-lha-rtse Monastery.

* **Competing Claims:** The Dil-mgo family, who held the wealth of mKhyen-brtse's estate, also sought a say in the succession. They supported another *sprul sku*, residing at Kaḥthog. This led to a complex situation where two *sprul sku*s claimed legitimacy, reflecting the tension between Ngor Monastery's authority and the family's interests.

* **Later Reincarnations:** After the first "body emanation" (*sku sprul*) died in rDzogs-chen, another boy was recognized as his reincarnation. This further complicated the succession issue, highlighting the ongoing struggle for control over mKhyen-brtse's legacy and estate.

# Mkhyen-Brtse Chos-Kyi-Blo-Gros Founds The Bshad Grwa

* mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros arrived at rDzong-gsar around 1909, though his exact age is debated.
* He was not fully qualified as a principal when he arrived but began teaching and collecting support for his position.
* He travelled throughout sDe-dge, exchanging teachings with various lineage holders.
* Chos-kyi-blo-gros received an intensive education before coming to rDzong-gsar and continued his studies there.

# Gzhan-Dga'S Arrival And Teaching In Rdzong-Gsar

* gZhan-dga' arrived in 1918 while the *bshad grwa* was still under construction.
* He initially stayed in a pavilion on top of the rTse'i-lha-khang temple and dreamt of the Sixteen Elders, interpreting it as a good omen for the college.
* gZhan-dga' began teaching classes above rMe-shod before moving to the completed *bshad grwa* later in 1918.
* He was formally installed as the first *mkhan po*, while Chos-kyi-blo-gros, who had nine years of teaching experience, likely did not participate regularly in his classes.

* The college faced initial difficulties, possibly due to fighting between Chinese and Tibetan troops in Khams that year.
* A dGe-lugs-pa monk disrupted a class with an army, highlighting the college's lack of political strength at the time.
* Dam-pa Rin-po-che composed a supplication to the four-armed Dharma protector, which helped quell disturbances and became central to the liturgy of Sa-skya sub-schools.

* The *bshad grwa* was well-endowed, with Chos-kyi-blo-gros providing food and financial support for students and teachers.
* It gained a reputation for its scholarly standards, attracting students from various Buddhist schools.
* gZhan-dga' likely stayed for two years (1918-1920), teaching basic Indian texts and delegating in-depth teaching to his advanced students.

## Blo-gter-dbang-Po'S Will: The Bshad Grwa In Skye-Dgu-Mdo

## Teaching At Skye-Dgu Don-Grub-Gling

* gZhan-dga' taught at the Sa-skya-pa monastery sKye-dgu Don-grub-gling, which housed around eight hundred monks.
* He was eagerly awaited and students came from all over sGa-pa to attend his classes.
* Blo-gter-dbang-po had laid the groundwork for the college years before gZhan-dga's arrival.

## Rab-Gsal-Zla-Ba'S Ordination And Studies

* bKra-shis-dpal-'byor, later known as Rab-gsal-zla-ba, received novice ordination from gZhan-dga'.
* He studied the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* under gZhan-dga's guidance and was praised for his comprehension.
* gZhan-dga' gave him the name 'Jigs-med-rabgsal-zla-ba, which inspired the title of his autobiography.
* Rab-gsal-zla-ba continued his studies with Karma Tshul-khrims and later received further teachings from gZhan-dga'.
* bShad-sgrub, Rab-gsal-zla-ba's brother, expressed discontent with gZhan-dga's teaching method and advocated for a more structured approach.
* gZhan-dga' may have composed commentaries in response to bShad-sgrub's criticism.
* gZhan-dga' gave Rab-gsal-zla-ba texts about *rdzogs pa chen po* from bsTan-lu's personal collection, suggesting he saw him as bsTan-lu's reincarnation.





## Sde-Gzhung Rin-Po-Che'S Studies In Don-Grub-Gling

* dKon-mchog-lhun-grub, later known as sDe-gzhung Rin-po-che, began his studies at Don-grub-gling in 1920.
* He participated in gZhan-dga's *Bodhicaryāvatāra* classes and learned the daily schedule of the *bshad grwa*.

* dKon-mchog-lhun-grub received several reading transmissions from gZhan-dga', including one on the Abhidharma-*kośa*.
* gZhan-dga' prophesied that he would be reborn in a land without Buddhism, which sDe-gzhung Rin-po-che later interpreted as America.

## Meeting With Sga-Ston And Departure From Skye-Dgu-Mdo

* During his time in sKye-dgu-mdo, gZhan-dga' took breaks from teaching and visited sGa-ston Ngag-dbang-legs-pa for an empowerment of Mahākāla.
* sGa-ston praised gZhan-dga's expertise and meditational realization, particularly his connection to the Four-Faced Mahākāla as a protector of Madhyamaka teachings.

* Despite facing criticism from upholders of different Buddhist traditions, gZhan-dga' declined to engage in scholarly debates or write rebuttals.
* He announced his intention to enter retreat and ultimately departed from sKye-dgu-mdo in 1922 (or possibly earlier).

## Did Gzhan-Dga'S Teaching Method Change Over Time?


* As gZhan-dga's fame grew, his teaching style may have shifted towards shorter transmissions (*bshad lung*) and less detailed explanations.
* This change could be attributed to the increasing demand for his teachings from both monastic and lay audiences.

* He may have delegated more in-depth instruction to his revision teachers (*skyor dpon*) while focusing on providing auspicious connections through reading transmissions and essential teachings.

## Journey Through Rdza-Chu-Kha Towards Ru-Dam
* gZhan-dga' visited family in Kha-na and declined their invitation to establish a monastery there.
* He continued his journey towards dGe-mang and rDzogschen, refusing invitations to teach at monasteries along the way.

## 3. Final Retreat And Death
* gZhan-dga' had fulfilled his promise to Blo-gterdbang-po by establishing Don-grub-gling college.

## Gzhan-Dga'S First Meeting With General Khyung-Ram-Pa
* The exact time and place of their first meeting is unknown.
* mKhan-po rTogs-grol reports that gZhan-dga' advised Khyung-ram-pa on ethical conduct, leading to Khyung-ram-pa showing devotion.

## Reunion With The Yogin Kun-Dga'-Dpal-Ldan
* Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan was a yogin and disciple of bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu who lived near rGya-bo-phu.
* gZhan-dga' became his main lineage holder for exposition, while Kun-dga'-bzang-po inherited his meditation lineage.
* Their proximity allowed for discussions on Dharma and strengthened the lineages of bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu.

## Brilliant Moon: Rab-Gsal-Zla-Ba'S Coming To Rgya-Bo-Phu

* gZhan-dga' invited young Rab-gsal-zla-ba to rGya-bo-phu for teachings, despite his vow of solitary retreat.
* The exact year of Rab-gsal-zla-ba's arrival is uncertain, but it was likely in 1921 or 1923.
* Upon arrival, Rab-gsal-zla-ba was welcomed with a ceremonial procession and met gZhan-dga'.

* gZhan-dga' performed a ritual washing ceremony and presented him with new robes.
* A grand feast and teachings followed, with gZhan-dga' emphasizing Rab-gsal-zla-ba's status as the *sprul sku*.

* gZhan-dga' instructed Rab-gsal-zla-ba in the *Kun bzang bla ma'*i zhal lung*, a text suitable for his age and background.
* Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse recalls receiving teachings, studying independently, and engaging in playful activities with gZhan-dga'.

* gZhan-dga' combined teachings with meditation practice, guiding Rab-gsal-zla-ba to reflect on the nature of mind.
* Rab-gsal-zla-ba experienced a realization of mind as both clear and empty, which was praised by gZhan-dga'.

* The teachings continued with the *Kun bzang bla ma'*i zhal lung*, including practices like refuge, prostrations, and Vajrasattva meditation.
* gZhan-dga' shared a story about bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu predicting that his *sprul sku* would face harsh treatment from a teacher.

* After completing the *Kun bzang bla ma'*i zhal lung*, gZhan-dga' taught Madhyamaka defenses and the Catu*ḥśataka*.
* Five Bhutanese students arrived, joining Rab-gsal-zla-ba in receiving teachings on gZhan-dga's commentary to dPal-sprul's *Thog mtha' bar gsum dge ba'i gtam*.

* Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse later transmitted these teachings widely, using gZhan-dga's commentary as his basis.
* Despite his initial intention for solitary retreat, gZhan-dga' found himself involved in teaching and managing a growing monastic center.


## Rab-Gsal-Zla-Ba'S Studies Under Ba-Thul Mkhan-Po

* After returning to lDan-khog, Rab-gsal-zla-ba studied at Sa-skyapa monastery Sa-dkar with his brother.
* Ba-thur mKhan-po, a disciple of bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu and gZhan-dga', was invited to teach them.

* Ba-thur mKhan-po also acted as preceptor during the summer retreat at Sa-dkar Monastery.
* He performed the sMe-brtsegs ritual for one of Rab-gsal-zla-ba's brothers who fell ill.


## The Khu-Nu Bla-Ma Becomes Gzhan-Dga'S Student

* bsTan-'dzin-rgyal-mtshan, a scholar from Kinnaur, sought teachings from gZhan-dga'.
* Initially hesitant due to his retreat vow, gZhan-dga' eventually agreed to teach him after hearing his situation.

* gZhan-dga' taught bsTan-'dzin-rgyal-mtshan all major treatises and even gave him his own books.
* bsTan-'dzin-rgyal-mtshan became a prominent student of gZhan-dga', known for his scholarship in both Tibetan and Sanskrit traditions.

* He later became known as the Khu-nu Bla-ma and was one of the main teachers of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama.

## Gzhan-Dga' And The Study Of Sanskrit

* gZhan-dga' studied Sanskrit grammar (*sgra*) but his knowledge was limited to a basic level.
* He relied heavily on Tibetan translations and acknowledged his indebtedness to ancient translators.
* His interpretation of Sanskrit grammar sometimes showed inaccuracies, possibly due to reliance on student notes or limitations in understanding.

## Death And Funeral Rites

* gZhan-dga' died at the age of 56 in early March 1927 after entrusting his testament to a disciple.
* Heavy snowfall hampered the transport of his remains from his mountain retreat to dPal-spungs.
* His cremation was attended by prominent figures, and numerous relics were found among the ashes.

* In the dream, gZhan-dga' gave raisins to Khenpo Khyenrab who then distributed them to sDe-gzhung Rin-po-che.
* sDe-gzhung Rin-po-che interpreted this dream as a sign that he would receive teachings from Khenpo Khyenrab, indirectly continuing his lineage with gZhan-dga'.

## Open Questions: Did Rab-Gsal-Zla-Ba Return To Rgya-Bo-Phu?

* The young Rab-gsal-zla-ba studied under gZhan-dga' at rGya-bo-phu for several months in 1921, 1922 or 1923.
* He returned home that autumn and was asked to return the following spring.
* There is no mention of Rab-gsal-zla-ba continuing his studies with gZhan-dga' in Dilmgo mKhyen-brtse's autobiography.
* In 1924, Rab-gsal-zla-ba went to Zhe-chen Monastery instead.

## The Sga-Len-Steng Mkhyen-Brtse'S Studies Under Gzhan-Dga'

* After mKhyen-brtse'i-dbang-po's passing in 1892, two incarnations were recognized: a "body emanation" and an "activity emanation."
* The body emanation died young, leaving the activity emanation, mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros, as the main candidate for the estate.
* A conflict arose over the inheritance of the estate between supporters of Chos-kyi-blo-gros and those supporting the younger body emanation, Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug.

* This conflict led to tension and even violence at rDzong-gsar Monastery.
* Bya-rgod sTobs-ldan, a powerful figure in Khams politics, intervened and issued a verdict that divided the estate between the two incarnations.
* Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug received the funds, while Chos-kyi-blo-gros retained control of the real estate and sacred objects.
* Bya-rgod sTobs-ldan used the funds to build a monastery for Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug in sGa-len.

* The whereabouts of Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug between the ages of ten and twenty remain unclear.

# rGya-bo-phu and gNas-phu

* Nam-mkha'i-nor-bu states that Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug, the body emanation of mKhyen-brtse, studied under Kunga Palden and gZhan-dga' at rGya-bo-phu and gNas-phu.
* He allegedly studied the Thirteen Great Texts and the *Guhyagarbha* tantra with gZhan-dga'.

* This account contradicts the dating of Bya-rgod sTobs-ldan's verdict on the mKhyen-brtse estate, as gZhan-dga' died in 1927.
* A possible explanation is that Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug did not stay permanently in rDzong-gsar during his youth and had a connection with Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan before 1929.

# The photo of Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug

* A photo suggests that Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug was not permanently in rDzong-gsar during his early teens.
* He is pictured with prominent figures like the prince of sDe-dge and Dam-pa Rin-po-che, suggesting he might have resided in sDe-dge dGonchen around 1924.

# Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan's teachings

* Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse's biography of Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan mentions his emphasis on combining study with meditation practice.
* This suggests that he encouraged his disciples to learn from gZhan-dga', supporting the union of Madhyamaka and rDzogs-chen.

# Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug's association with Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan

* Kun-dga'-dpal-ldan was born in sGa-len-steng, which became the main seat of Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug after Bya-rgod sTobs-ldan's verdict.
* This suggests that their association predates the verdict and supports the possibility of Chos-kyi-dbang-phyug's apprenticeship under gZhan-dga' in gNas-phu.

# Open Questions: Rab-Gsal-Zla-Ba And Rgya-Bo-Phu


* The reasons for Rab-gsal-zla-ba discontinuing his education under gZhan-dga' are unclear.
* Possible explanations include:
    * Misgivings from Rab-gsal-zla-ba's brother, bShadsgrub, about gZhan-dga's methods and qualifications.

    * The letter carrying the Karmapa's seal condemning gZhan-dga's critique of gZhan-stong might have become known in lDan-khog.
    * gZhan-dga' might have tried to enthrone Rab-gsal-zla-ba without prior consent from his family, although this is unlikely given the circumstances.

* The letter carrying the Karmapa's seal seems to be the most likely reason for Rab-gsal-zla-ba's move to Zhe-chen in 1924.

## The Sga-Len-Steng Mkhyen-Brtse'S Later Years In Rgya-Bo-Phu

* Sources are unclear about the relationship between gZhan-dga' and his "body emanation."
* Nam-mkha'i-nor-bu records that Mkhyen-brtse traveled to A-'dzom 'Brug-pa's encampment in 1922, staying for nineteen months.
* He then went into a three-year retreat at Padma-shel-phug.

## Afterword: Was Gzhan-Dga' An Educational Reformer?

* gZhan-dga' is remembered as the forefather of prestigious colleges but his biography suggests he focused on solid curriculum rather than broad reform.
* He was a focused scholar who followed dPal-sprul's example, emphasizing systematic study and opposing violence in education.
* His career path was influenced by circumstance: leaving Śrī-Siṃha due to Zhao's campaign, being invited to dPal-spungs, and eventually being poached by mKhyen-brtse Chos-kyi-blo-gros for rGya-bo-phu.
* gZhan-dga' spread his tradition through students who established colleges in his style.
* He was not driven by ambition but rather focused on fulfilling his role as a teacher and leader, resulting in a lasting impact on Tibetan Buddhist education.

# Gloss Commentaries On The Thirteen Great Texts

* gZhan-dga's most influential work is the Gloss Commentaries on the Thirteen Great Texts (gZhung chen bcu gsum gyi mchan '*grel*), a collection of gloss commentaries on nineteen major Indian Buddhist treatises. 
* These commentaries are unique because they primarily consist of explanations from Indian commentators inserted between the words of the original text, rather than gZhan-dga's own interpretations.
* This approach allowed students from various Tibetan Buddhist traditions to study Indian Buddhist thought under a common framework, transcending sectarian boundaries.

# How Impartial Was Gzhan-Dga'S Choice Of Texts?

* While gZhan-dga' chose Indian texts as the basis for his commentaries, his selection was influenced by Tibetan scholastic traditions.
* He adhered to the "Eighteen of Great Renown," a set of texts established by Tibetan scholars, which neglected Yogācāra treatises important in India.
* This resulted in an underrepresentation of Yogācāra thought in gZhan-dga's corpus, as he favored the Abhidharma-*kośa* over the *Abhidharma-samuccaya*, and excluded Pramāṇa treatises that contained Yogācāra perspectives.

* Although gZhan-dga's glosses on the Five Dharmas of Maitreya are highly regarded even by adherents to the gZhan-stong view, his exclusive reliance on śāstra texts may have disadvantaged students from traditional gZhan-stong centers.
* The concise nature of mchan '*grel* also limited gZhan-dga's ability to represent conflicting interpretations of a text, often favoring one interpretation over others.

## Which Texts Are Counted As The Thirteen Great Texts?

* Zurmang mKhan-chen Padma-rnam-rgyal identified thirteen texts as the "Thirteen Great Texts".
* These thirteen texts are a subset of a larger corpus called the "Eighteen of Great Renown". 
* The "Eighteen of Great Renown" was established by Tibetan scholars g.Yag-ston Sangs-rgyas-dpal and Red-mda'-ba gZhon-nu-blo-gros.

##  The "Eighteen of Great Renown"


* This corpus includes texts on Pramāṇa, Vinaya, Abhidharma, The Five Dharmas of Maitreya, Madhyamaka, Prajñāpāramitā, and works by Sa-skya Paṇḍita.
*  The "Eighteen of Great Renown" differs from Padma-rnam-rgyal's "Thirteen Great Texts" by including texts on Pramāṇa and works by Tibetan authors.

## The "Thirteen Great Texts"

* Padma-rnam-rgyal's list corresponds to the "Eighteen of Great Renown", excluding texts on Pramāṇa and works by Tibetan authors.
*  The *Bodhicaryāvatāra* is included in Padma-rnam-rgyal's list but not in the "Eighteen of Great Renown".
* The reason for the *Bodhicaryāvatāra*'s inclusion is unclear, as it was not part of a standard three-text Madhyamaka corpus. 




## Which Texts Are Contained In The Corpus Gloss Commentaries On The Thirteen Great Texts?

* **Thirteen Great Texts:**

    * mKhan-chen Padma-rnam-rgyal identified thirteen Indian treatises as the "Thirteen Great Texts."
    * These texts are central to Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.

* **Branch Texts:**

    * Padma-rnam-rgyal mentions additional "branch texts" related to the Thirteen Great Texts.
    * Nineteen texts, including six branch texts, are found in his teaching aids.

* **Corpus Composition:**

    * The corpus of gloss commentaries likely grew gradually over gZhan-dga's teaching career.
    * Some commentaries were composed while he was actively teaching the corresponding texts.

* **Madhyamakāvatāra Commentaries:**

    * Two commentaries exist for the *Madhyamakāvatāra*: a shorter and a longer one.
    * The longer commentary may have been written later, possibly in response to criticism of gZhan-dga's teaching methods.

* **Bodhicaryāvatāra Commentary:**

    * gZhan-dga' studied the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* under Kunbzang-dpal-ldan, a renowned commentator on the text.
    * He often taught the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* first when establishing new colleges.

* **Guhyagarbha-tattva-viniścaya:**

    * This tantric text is not classified as one of the Thirteen Great Texts.
    * gZhan-dga's commentary on it is based solely on Klong-chen-pa's commentary, unlike his commentaries on other texts.

* **Śikṣāsamuccaya-kārikā Commentary:**

    * A commentary on this text exists in only one edition of the corpus.
    * Its position within gZhan-dga's writings is unclear without further analysis.

# Minor Works Of Mkhan-Po Gzhan-Dga'

* The text was found in four different publications.
* Two texts were published individually: *Shes bya gsal ba'i me long* and *Thog mtha' bar gsum dge ba'i gtam gyi 'bru 'grel rgyal sras lam bzang*.

* The remaining texts are found in two collections from dPal-spungs: *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor* and *Nyams bzhes rtogs mgur*.
* Only reproductions of the title pages of these dPal-spungs editions are preserved.
* In 1985, the *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor* was published in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Literature Series (IBL).

* Later, in 1993, both collections were published by rGyal-dbang-nyi-ma (GNy) and a 'Jigs-med-shes-rab-'od-zer.
* There are significant differences in contents between the IBL and the GNy editions of the *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor*.

    * The *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor* was published in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Literature Series (IBL) in 1985.
    * Both collections were published by rGyal-dbang-nyi-ma (GNy) and a 'Jigs-med-shes-rab-'od-zer in 1993.



## A 1993 Collection Edited By Rgyal-Dbang-Nyi-Ma [Gny]

* **Formal Description:** This is a photomechanical reproduction of a *dbu can* manuscript measuring 8,5 cm x 38,5 cm. It uses Tibetan pagination in words on the left and Western pagination in printed numbers on the right. There is no title page for the collection GNy. The first page is the title page for the Rigs brgya'*i khyab bdag...* by mKhyen-rab-'od-zer {7}.

* **Colophon:** The manuscript colophon, located on p. 113, fol. 19a3, mentions rGyal-dbang-nyi-ma as the author and states that it was written in 1993 at Dar-rtse-mdo. A printing colophon on p. 115 identifies 'Jigs-med-shes-rab-'od-gsal as the author.

* **Contents:** The collection GNy contains three texts:
    * **The Rigs brgya'i khyab bdag kun bzang bla ma gzhan phan chos kyi snang ba la cung zad bstod pa blo ldan dgyes pa'i mchod sprin by mKhyenrab-'od-zer** (pp. 1–12).
    * **The Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor** (pp. 13–76), arranged as in IBL.
    * **The Nyams bzhes rtogs mgur** (pp. 77–113) by gZhan-dga'.

## The Zhal Gdams 'Bel Gtam Gyi Skor In Gny

* This section follows the order of IBL for texts [36]–[44].
* It includes additional texts: *dBu ma'i smon lam* [28], *dBu ma'*i smon lam bsdus pa* [29], prayers for dedication by gZhan-dga' [65], a '*chad thabs*' for Klong-chen-pa's *Chos dbyings mdzod* [66], a discourse of the subsections of Madhyamaka [67], and the praise of Candrakīrti [17].

## The Nyams Bzhes Rtogs Mgur In Gny

* This section begins with the title: *rJe btsun thams cad mkhyen gzigs gzhan phan chos kyi snang ba'i nyams bzhes rtogs mgur skor bzhugs so*.
* It contains texts [68]–[85].

## A 2004 Collection Published In Khams-Bye

* This collection, published in Khams-bye in 2004, includes both the *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor* and the *Nyams bzhes rtogs mgur*.
* The titles of individual pieces within these works seem to have been added by an editor rather than gZhan-dga' himself.

## Texts Contained in Zhal gdams '*bel gtam gyi skor* according to IBL

This section provides detailed information about each text contained in the *Zhal gdams 'bel gtam gyi skor*, including:
* **Title:** Each text has a title, some of which were added by an editor.

* **Colophon:** Information about the colophon, including the author and date of composition, is provided.
* **Subject:** A brief description of the content of each text is given.
* **Other Editions:** If other editions of the text exist, they are mentioned here.

The texts listed include:

* [35] [A Condensed Lam-Rim Treatise]
* [36] [Verses On Bodhicitta And Conduct]
* [37] [Verses On The Path Of Study And Meditation]
* [38] [Praise To Go-Rams-Pa]
* [39] Sa Skya Paṇḍi Ta'I Thugs Brgyud Bskul Ba'I Gsol 'Debs
* [40] Lha'I Rol Mo

## [43] Advice to Ngag-dbang-nor-bu

* **Subject:** A religious discourse ('*bel gtam*) given by gZhan-dga' to his disciple Ngag-dbang-nor-bu, probably Yab-chen Ngag-dbang-nor-bu {30}, the father of the sixth rDzogs-chen Rin-po-che, mentioned in *rDzogs chen lo rgyus*, p.132.

## [44] Treatise On The Yogācāra School

* **Subject:** A general teaching aid ('*chad thabs*) explaining the preliminary and concluding steps when teaching an Indian Buddhist treatise (*śāstra*). 
* **Note:** This text is not contained in GNy.

## [28] Dbu Ma'I Smon Lam

* **Subject:**  Although the xylograph colophon was naturally prepared in the occasion of carving a new set of blocks, we find no explicit description which were the blocks in question. The occasion might have been the carving of text no. [28] (the IBL-Edition) exclusively, or, more probably carving some or all of the texts contained in the Zhal gdams '*bel gtam* before [28], namely [36]– [46].

## [46] On Conduct And Motivation During The Teaching Of Buddhist Doctrine

* **Subject:** A short exposition of the proper motivation and behaviour of teacher and student respectively during a teaching session. 
* **Note:** This text is not contained in GNy.

## [47] On Refuge And Bodhicitta

* **Subject:** short instruction on the subjects of refuge and *bodhicitta*.
* **Note:** Considering the arrangement of the first chapters of dPal-sprul Rinpo-che's classic "rDzogs pa chen po klong chen snying thig gi sngon 'gro'i khrid yig kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung," one might consider [46] and [47] to be a single work, outlining 1.) listening to instructions [46], followed by 2.) refuge and 3.) *bodhicitta* [47]. Nonetheless, several subtopics are dealt with once in [46] and once [47]. For example, the three kinds of *cittotpāda* are dealt with in [46] on fols. 27a–27b, and in [47] on fol. 29a.
* **Note:** This text is not contained in GNy.

## [48] Verses For Khyung-Ram-Pa On Ethical Conduct

## [50] Verses on the Experience of *rDzogs pa chen po*

* **Subject:** Verses on the mystical experience of *rdzogs pa chen po*, written for a mDo-sngags. This was probably Bod-pa sPrul-sku, mDo-sngags-bstan-pa'inyi-ma (ca. 1900–1959), a disciple of Kun-dpal (Kun-bzang-dpal-ldan). A short biography of Bod-pa sPrul-sku is contained in the 1996 edition of his lTa grub shan 'byed gnad kyi sgron me'i rtsa 'grel. He was a teacher of Sangsrgyas-bstan-'dzin (Macdonald 1981: 66).
* **Note:** This text is not contained in GNy.

## [51] Verses To Be-Hu O-Rgyan-Mkhyen-Pa On The Buddhist Path Of Study And Meditation

## Texts Published Separately

* A biography of dBon-po bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu, published by a mKhanpo Don-nyid in dGe-mang, 2007. Used by Mathieu Ricard for the outline of dBon-po bTsan-'dzin-nor-bu's life (*Enlightened Vagabond*, pp. 215–218). The passing of bsTan-'dzin-nor-bu seems to be wrongly dated to 1910 in this text, but this might be a simple misprint in *Enlightened Vagabond*.

* mKhan-po Chos-dga' used the same source for his biography of gZhan-dga' and dates the passing of bsTan-lu to around 1900 (ChG-ChJ, pp. 38f., 203). I could not examine a copy of this text.

## Works Wrongly Ascribed To Gzhan-Dga'

* In pro-modern Tibetan Buddhism, we rarely find detailed records where and how minor works were found after an author's passing, and as a rule, we have to consider the possibility that one or the other piece of writing has been included by mistake (or even intent). Furthermore, it is as rule possible that students provided lecture notes (*zin bris*) and other assistance in the process of composition.

* At least two works have been wrongly ascribed to gZhan-dga' in recent catalogs. Since both works are of historical importance, they are described here in detail.

## (1) Rje Bla Ma'I Rnal 'Byor Byin Rlabs Bdud Rtsi'I Sprin Phung

* **Appendix 1: Gzhan-Dga' On Pramāṇa And Debate:**
    * This section explores the complex relationship between logic (Pramāṇa) and Buddhist teachings, particularly in the context of Tibetan Buddhism.
    * It discusses gZhan-dga', a prominent Tibetan scholar who initially studied Pramāṇa but later distanced himself from it.
    * The text examines various perspectives on Pramāṇa, including those of Atisha, Candrakīrti, and Tsongkhapa.
    * It highlights the historical context of debates between Buddhists and non-Buddhists in India and Tibet, and how these debates influenced the development of Buddhist philosophy.
    * The section concludes by suggesting that gZhan-dga's rejection of Pramāṇa may have stemmed from his emphasis on original Indian texts and his preference for Candrakīrti's approach to Madhyamaka philosophy.

## Gzhan-Dga'S Own Position

* gZhan-dga' did not write a commentary on Pramāṇa treatises by Dignāga or Dharmakīrti.
* He wrote a tractatus focusing on Candrakīrti's dialectical method, aiming to convince fellow rNying-ma scholars to accept Candrakīrti's interpretation of Madhyamaka.
* There are discrepancies between gZhan-dga's acceptance and rejection of Pramāṇa.

## Gzhan-Dga'S Disciples: Sa-Paṇ'S Advice Revisited

* gZhan-dga' left a gap by not providing a gloss-commentary on an Indian Pramāṇa treatise, which was later filled by his disciple dBon-stod mKhyen-rab.
* Dam-pa Rin-po-che emphasized the importance of Pramāṇa among Sa-skya-pa students of gZhan-dga'.
* gZhan-dga's views on Pramāṇa may have differed from those of his students who were in charge of institutes of higher education.
* sDe-gzhung Rin-po-che was advised to study Pramāṇa after learning Abhidharma, highlighting the importance of a foundational understanding before delving into Pramāṇa.

## Debate In Gzhan-Dga'S Tradition

* Paltrul Rinpoche encountered sectarian monks at Dargye Monastery who demanded to know his Buddhist school affiliation. 
* He tactfully responded that he followed the teachings of the Buddha, highlighting the importance of focusing on the essence of Buddhism rather than rigid sectarian divisions.
* Tibetan Buddhist debate tradition combines elements of "Sautrāntika" Pramāṇa treatises and Candrakīrti's rhetoric, employing ritualized gestures.

* This system allows for a large number of students to be taught by few teachers through rigorous examination and debate. 
* However, the physical aspects of the debate raise ethical concerns about whether they align with monastic discipline.

* Some argue that aggressive behavior during debates can increase defilements rather than purify them.
* gZhan-dga' himself experienced bullying as a young monk and his teacher bsTan-lu discouraged intimidating gestures towards debaters, suggesting they generate negative karma. 

* While gZhan-dga' acknowledged the importance of debate, he prioritized direct engagement with original texts over relying on debate manuals.
* He believed that studying the primary sources was crucial for a deep understanding of Buddhist teachings.

* This approach contrasted with the dGe-lugs-pa tradition, which used manuals for debate training. 
* gZhan-dga's method proved effective in producing skilled debaters who could confidently engage with original texts.

* The amount of his studies under gZhan-dga' is unknown. He possibly attended some of his classes at La-sye-sgang, but there is no record that he received teachings or transmissions from gZhan-dga' in rDzong-gsar.
* As a rule, his biographers do not count gZhan-dga' among his teachers. (ca. 1896–1958).

## {33} Dil-Mgo Mkhyen-Brtse

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (3).
* For his biography see Ricard (1996) and *Brilliant Moon*. 
* (TBRC-P625)

## {34} Nyag-rong sPrul-sku 'Jam-dbyangs-dbang-rgyal, Nyag-rong Gu-ru sPrul-sku

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (13).
* A native of the 'Bri-gung area (date of birth unknown), he had been recognized as a reincarnation of Gu-ru-dgon (TBRC-G1593) in Nyag-rong (*Nyi lcang*, p. 7).
* He was the founding *mkhan po* at the Nyi-ma-lcang-ra college in near 'Bri-gung-mthil (rDzogs chen chos '*byung,* vol. 2, p. 404; Marvelous Garland, p. 501f.).
* Although he was invited to reside in Gu-rudgon, he did not go until another invitation by the bursar (*phyag mdzod*) of that monastery and the local ruler (*yul dpon*) arrived in 1943 (*Nyi lcang*, p. 7).

## {35} 'Dzi-Sgar Kong-Sprul

* Student no. in rDzogs chen chos 'b*yung*: (15).
* Studied with gZhan-dga' in dPal-spungs. See *rDzogs chen chos 'byung,* vol. 2, p. 400.
* See also p. 402 (name misspelled as *dzi sgar*).

## {36} A-dbyangs-thub-bstan, dGe-slong-rin-po-che

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (16).
* The spelling Aḥ-dbyangs-thub-bstan (*rDzogs chen chos 'byung*) seems to be incorrect. Either "Āḥ-dbyangs" or "A-dbyangs" seem to be more sensible from the point of view of tantric symbolism.
* He is surely identical to A-dbyangs-thub-bstan, a *sprul sku* of the 'Bri-gung-pa monastery sGrubbrgyud-dgon was a descendant of the rGya-kong family and a close relative of gZhan-dga'.
* Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse Rin-po-che, information recorded by Matthieu Ricard (see Saint *in Seattle*, p. 584, n. 99).

## {37} Bstan-'Dzin-Snyan-Grags

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (17).
* He is referred to as "a high *sprul sku* of those from Mount dGe-ldan" (*rDzogs chen chos 'byung,* vol. 2, p. 394), which might either indicate that he came from the dGe-lugs-pa tradition, or that he was in fact a *sprul sku* of dGa'-ldan Monastery.
* Since his more complete name was surely Blo-bzangbstan-'dzin-snyan-grags, he might be identical with Blo-bzang-bstan-'dzin {14}.

## {38} Khu-Nu Bstan-'Dzin-Rgyal-Mtshan

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (18).
* The Khu-nu Bla-ma taught at the Kun-gzigs-slob-grwa in gZhis-kartse (Chos-'phel-rdo-rje, "De snga'i bod...", p. 37) and studied with gZhan-dga' in rGya-bo-phu.
* See also *rDzogs chen chos 'byung,* vol. 2, p. 414ff. (1885–1977, TBRC-P740).

## {40} sGrub-brgyud Rin-po-che

* Student no. in rDzogs chen chos 'byung: (24).

## {41} Lug-Ru Mkhan-Chen

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (25).
* Studied with gZhan-dga' in dPal-spungs. See *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*, vol. 2, p. 400.

## {42} Cab-Ra Mkhan-Chen

* Student no. in *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*: (26).
* Studied with gZhan-dga' in dPal-spungs. See *rDzogs chen chos 'byung*, vol. 2, p. 400.
* "Cab-ra" (also found in ChG-ChJ, p. 198) might be a misspelling for lCang-ra or lCags-ra.

## {43} sGa Bla-ma 'Jam-dbyangs-rgyal-mtshan, 'Jam-rgyal Rin-po-che

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (2).
* For his extensive biography, see Kun-dga'-bstan-pa'i-nyi-ma, *rJe btsun* bla ma dam pa '*jam dbyangs rgyal mtshan...*.
* He started studying under gZhan-dga' already in dGe-mang and rDzogs-chen (*ibid*, p. 19ff.).
* A short biography is contained in *Khams bye,* pp. 121–122. (1870–1940, TBRC-P970. The entry TBRC-P5877 for 'Jam-rgyal is redundant.)

## {44} Ngor Khang-sar Zhabs-drung Dam-pa Rin-po-che

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (3).
* For his biography, see gDong-thog bsTan-pa'i-rgyal-mtshan, *rJe btsun* bla ma dpal..., and *Sa skya lo rgyus*, pp. 340–349.
* He started studying under gZhan-dga' already in rDzogs-chen (Jackson 2001: 89). See also Jackson (1989a: 83) and bSam-gtan-blo-gros, "gSang bdag rdo rje 'dzin pa...", fol. 41b.

* Student no. in Khams bye: (8).

## {46} Brag-G.Yab Thub-Bstan

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (10).
* For a biographical sketch of Thub-bstan-bzang-po (1891/2–ca.1930), see Jackson (1997,"A Reviver of Sa-skya-pa Scriptural Studies." Based on his studies with gZhan-dga', Brag-g.yab Thub-bstan furthered the studies of the main Indian treatises, first in Khams and then in Central Tibet.

## {47} Gtsang-Sar Mchog-Sprul

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (11).
* He is also mentioned in Dil-mgo mKhyen-brtse, "Rigs dkyil rgya mtsho'i khyab bdag...", as Brag-yab [sic] gTsang-sar mChog-sprul.

## {48} gTsang-sar Kun-dga'-blo-gros

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (12).

* Student no. in *Khams bye*: (16).
* According to *Khams bye*, p. 120, he was the *mkhan po* of Brag-g.yab Sa-dkar Ri-khrod. A Sa-dkar Ri-khrod, connected with Brag-g.yab is mentioned in sKyabs-rje Khri-byang Rin-po-che, dGa' *ldan khri chen...*, fol. 151b.
* Nonetheless, this seems to be a dGe-lugs-pa establishment while the name Karma rNam-rgyal indicated a Karma bKa'-brgyud scholar or someone who had been ordained by a Karma bKa'-brgyud lama.

## {52} Sangs-Rgyas-Bzang-Po

* Said to be gZhan-dga's student in Ehrhard (1996: 3)
* Born in 1894, he studied with gZhan-dga' and his disciples from 1916 to 1927 (Ehrhard 1996: 3). He probably wrote the colophon to the Nyi-malcang-ra edition of the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* commentary [15] and is possibly identical with a Sangs-rgyas-bzang-po mentioned in the entry TBRC-P 6769 (1883–1954, active in Khri-'du dGon-sar Monastery).

## {53} Padma-Nor-Bu

* Said to be gZhan-dga's student in *Khams bye*, p. 120
* He was from a monastery called rGya-ra-dgon (*Khams bye*, p. 120). A monastery belonging to Zur-mang rNam-rgyal-rtse was called rGya-ba or rGya-ra.
