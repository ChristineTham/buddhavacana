## Introduction

* Cessation (nirodha) plays a crucial role in early Buddhist Nikāya texts.
* It signifies the end of suffering (dukkhanirodha), the third noble truth.
* Texts emphasize cessation or non-occurrence of elements traditionally considered psychophysical constituents of an individual.
* Cessation is often presented as part of "dependent cessation," reversing the scheme of dependent origination.

## Cessation as a Special Meditative State

* Cessation can be understood as occurring after death, as impermanence, or during life in a special meditative state.
* Several texts explicitly describe cessation of elements considered constitutive of a human being during their lifetime.
* Examples include the Kāmaguṇa Sutta, Nimokkha Sutta, Pot.t.hapāda Sutta, and Dutiyasikkhattaya Sutta.

## Philosophical Implications of Cessation

* Some Nikāya texts use an apophatic strategy to express the paradoxical nature of cessation.
* They deny all modes of consciousness while emphasizing continued cognizance in some way.
* This suggests cessation is not ordinary insentience but a special form of cognition, potentially the highest insight.
* The essay aims to explore the philosophical questions raised by this concept:

    * What undergoes cessation?
    * What type of insight occurs in this state?
    * How does cessation occur?
    * What is the first-person content of this state?
    * Is there anything it is like to be in a state of cessation?


## Comparative Perspective

* The essay proposes using a cross-cultural comparative perspective, drawing on modern Western philosophy of mind.
* This approach can offer fresh insights into the Nikāya notion of cessation by:

    * Exploring parallels with ideas in modern philosophy of mind.
    * Considering whether cessation is possible from a modern philosophical standpoint.
    * Using modern philosophical terminology to express early Buddhist ideas.




# Does Cessation Involve The Mind?

* Cessation of mental khandha-s could be seen as insentience or unconsciousness.
* Some texts suggest paradoxical cognition in this state.
*  Nirodha samāpatti might have been an attempt to understand ineffable liberation experiences.
* Vasumitra considered nirodhasamāpatti to be sacittakā (endowed with mind).

# The Nature of Mind and Consciousness

* Nikāyas equate citta with viññāṇa, making cessation of saññā and vedanā impossible if citta persists.
* Some texts imply separation of mind from mental khandha-s, including viññāṇa.
* Dutiyasikkhattaya Sutta: Cessation of viññāṇa is liberation of the mind.
* Vāhana Sutta: Tathāgata dwells with a dissociated mind detached from all khandha-s.

#  Citta and Viññāṇa

* Citta is used functionally, as a mental faculty producing cognitive effects.
* Viññāṇa has phenomenal qualitative content associated with sense modalities.
* Citta is never explicitly said to be subject to cessation.




## Limitations Of Ordinary Phenomenal Consciousness As A Medium Of Cognizing Reality

*  Ordinary phenomenal consciousness might be a distorted representation of reality due to its constructed nature.
*  It relies on memory and processing, leading to a delay between experience and the present moment.
*  Phenomenal consciousness is inherently tied to the sense of self, which may hinder direct cognition of reality.
* Some philosophers argue that even fundamental subjectivity is constructed by unconscious processes.

## Does Cessation Occur In Ordinary Life?

* Blindsight and reports from meditators suggest that cognition can occur without phenomenal consciousness.
*  Researchers propose that conscious cognition occurs in discrete episodes separated by periods of unconsciousness.
* These "cognitive cessations" might be too short to notice, but their prolonged occurrence during meditation could contribute to soteriological goals.
* Meditation's state of relative idleness allows cognitive resources to be directed towards transformative insight. 




## Can Cessation Be A State Of Insight?

* Some modern philosophers suggest that most cognition functions in a globally unavailable way, meaning its content is not accessible for introspection, speech, memory, and reflection.
* This unconscious information processing is used to explain phenomena like the "eureka" moment, where solutions arise after a period of incubation.
* The text argues that complex cognitive operations, including decision-making, can occur unconsciously.

## The Mechanism Of Cessation

* Ordinary phenomenal consciousness doesn't keep up with the present and consists of discrete episodes separated by periods not available for introspection.
* Cessation could be conceived as a state where cognition keeps up so faithfully with the present that there is no space for ordinary phenomenal consciousness to arise.
* This aligns with the idea that mindfulness practiced towards feelings can cause consciousness to cease, as perfect mindfulness would prevent ordinary phenomenal consciousness from interfering.

## The Cognitive Content of Cessation and the Issue of Its Expressibility

* Cessation could be viewed as a state of insight, "seeing things as they are," but what does this mean in detail?
* Early Buddhist texts suggest a radically apophatic approach, denying basic categories characterizing our experience.
* This implies that a view of reality consisting of bodies and objects is dependent on a particular way of cognitive processing and not reflective of objective reality.



# First-Person Cognitive Content in States of Cessation

* A person in a state of cessation would not have the familiar linguistically expressible reality of bodies and objects as their cognitive content.
* Although sensory input might be the same, due to the turning off of higher-level processing it would appear different and unimaginable from the perspective of ordinary consciousness.

# Coexistence of Perspectives on Cessation

* Nikāyas present two perspectives: a third-person cataphatic perspective where a meditator is said to have a body and senses, and a completely apophatic "inner" perspective where these categories do not apply.
* First-person cataphatic descriptions are present in meditative states where total cessation of the sal.āyatana-s and the khandha-s has not yet occurred.

# The Question of First-Person Content

* It is unclear if there is any first-person content in a state of cessation, or what it is like to be in such a state.
* Sal.āyatana-s may represent phenomenal sense modalities involving duality between subject and object.
* If so, Buddhas and arahants might experience phenomena of a different kind in cessation.

# Cessation as a Blank Moment?

* The total indescribability of an awakened person suggests cessation might be a blank moment, a gap in memory.
* This raises the question of whether it would be like being unconscious or a zombie.
* If a state is not globally available and recollectible, it might not be distinguishable from phenomenally unconscious states.

# Rethinking Consciousness through Cessation

* Garfield suggests that states of absorption or flow, while lacking self-reflective phenomenal feeling, are still fully engaged and present in a functional sense.
* Early Buddhist cessation could be seen as a cognitive state close to our true being, free from illusions.
