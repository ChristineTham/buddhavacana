# Article The Pleasure Of Not Experiencing Anything: Some Reflections On Consciousness In The Context Of The Early Buddhist Nikayas ¯

* Sariputta's statement that pleasure lies in the absence of experience is paradoxical from a commonsense perspective.
* This paper aims to reconstruct the philosophical backdrop of this claim by examining relevant Nikaya passages and drawing on modern cognitive science and philosophy of mind.
* The author suggests that "vedayita" (experience) refers to a type of consciousness characterized by phenomenal content, introspectability, reportability, and integration into memory.

# 1. Introduction

* Sariputta's statement about pleasure arising from the absence of experience is found in the *Nibbanasukha-sutta*.
* This claim is presented within the context of a discussion on the nature of *nibbana*, which is considered the ultimate good in Buddhism.
* The paper will explore the meaning and implications of Sariputta's statement, considering its potential philosophical significance.

# 2. Aims Of This Paper

* The author acknowledges the apparent absurdity of Sariputta's claim from a commonsense perspective.
* However, they propose to take the statement seriously as an invitation to re-examine our understanding of experience and consciousness.
* The paper aims to reconstruct the philosophical context within which this statement can be understood, drawing on early Buddhist texts and contemporary philosophy of mind.

## 3. On The Meaning Of Vedayita And **Sukha**

*  *Vedayita* means "experienced" or "felt".
* It can refer to affectively valent aspects of experience, but in the Nikaya context, it refers to conscious experience in its entirety.
* *Sukha*, often translated as pleasure, happiness, or ease, refers to a positive affect felt during a particular timeframe.

## 4. Vedayita, Dukkha **And The Aggregates**

* Uday¯ı and Sariputta imply that *nibbana* is a state without *vedayita*.
* Sariputta considers all forms of *vedayita* to be *dukkha*, including perceptions and acts of attention connected with sublime spiritual qualities.
* The Nikayas often equate the five aggregates (*pañcakkhandha*) with *dukkha*.

*  The denotation of *vedayita* overlaps with that of *pañcakkhandha*.
* The five aggregates denote various aspects and elements of ordinary conscious experience from a first-person perspective.
* Each aggregate refers to the same conscious experience, emphasizing its different aspects.
* The absence of *vedayita* would be tantamount to the absence of the remaining aggregates, including subjective phenomenal awareness of one's body.

## 5. Is Vedayita **The Only Way Of Being Sentient, Cognizant And Engaged In The World?**

* The Nikayas do not consider the aggregates to be all there is to a human being or cognition.
* Crucial bodily and cognitive aspects are not conceptualized in terms of *khandha*s.
* A distinction exists between *citta/cetas*, *viñña¯n.*a, and the aggregates.
* The Nikayas use different terms for engaging mental capabilities and describing first-person conscious experience.

* Sariputta's statement about *vedayita* does not imply that this is the only way to be sentient, cognizant, and engaged in the world.
* Buddhist psychology recognizes multiple kinds and levels of consciousness, including sensory, conceptual, introspectible, and non-introspectible forms.

* Absence of *vedayita* may not mean total absence of cognition and sentience but rather the absence of ordinary consciousness.
* Ordinary consciousness is globally available, introspectable, and expressible in speech or movement. It is also phenomenal and self-conscious.

## 6. The Notion Of Meditative Cessation Of **Vedayita**


* Nikaya texts may contain a notion of a state where the absence of conscious experience does not coincide with total mental and sensory stasis.
* Sariputta's statement about *saññavedayitanirodha* as a state of *sukha* might imply a different understanding than the historically dominant Theravada interpretation.

* Some scholars suggest that *saññavedayitanirodha* was understood as allowing for receptivity of the senses and cognitive insight.
* *Animitta cetosamadhi* (featureless unification of the mind) may be another term used to describe a similar state.
* This type of cessation might involve suspending higher-level processes while allowing basic cognitive functions to continue unimpeded.

* The Mulapariy ¯ *aya-sutta* suggests that awakened beings directly know reality without perceiving it.
* The At.*t.hakavagga* speaks of a direct mode of cognition without fashioning even a minute *sañña¯*.

* This notion parallels the Yogac¯ ara idea of a´sraya-par ¯ av¯ r.tti (overturning of the basis), where ordinary consciousnesses are replaced by enlightened cognitive abilities.

## 7. Is Consciousness An Ever-Present Feature Of Our Being In The World?

* Commonsense views often equate being conscious with being cognitively active and engaged.
* Modern psychology suggests that many cognitive processes occur unconsciously.
* Mark Solms proposes that consciousness acts as an "alarm mechanism" triggered by unusual situations requiring new solutions.
* Conscious experience, through feelings, guides choices in uncertain situations.

* Theories of global availability suggest consciousness allows for sharing information across different cognitive modules.
* This facilitates problem-solving and planning by bringing issues into conscious awareness for broader processing.

* Consciousness may have evolved to provide a unified sense of self from otherwise disjointed processes.
* The "phenomenal Self-model" arises from identifying with this unified experience.

* Solms argues that, from a thermodynamic perspective, minimizing free energy favors unconscious automatic behavior over conscious processing.
* This suggests consciousness is not constantly necessary and there may be periods where it's absent without our awareness.

## 8. Is Consciousness Generated At A Constant Rate? Re-Examining The Nature Of Absorption

* Some cognitive scientists propose that consciousness occurs in discrete episodes separated by unconscious periods.
* Lionel Naccache suggests conscious states are "temporal islets" interspersed with unconsciousness, creating a perceived continuous stream of consciousness.
* This implies there are times when the brain doesn't generate globally available representations associated with ordinary conscious experience.

* Absorption, or immersion in an activity, is characterized by merging action and awareness, distorted time perception, and diminished self-consciousness.
* These states often involve feelings of pleasure and satisfaction but are not fully accessible to introspection due to their nature.

* A hypothesis suggests that the features of absorption correlate with a relative absence of access consciousness during specific time intervals.
* Understanding this correlation may shed light on the relationship between the absence of ordinary consciousness and states of *sukha* (happiness) described in Buddhist texts.

## 9. What Accounts For The Specific Features Of Absorbed States?

* Subjective feeling of time passing is different from objective time.
* During flow (absorption), sense of time becomes distorted and we may lose track of time.

* No internal "timer" for psychological time, but a constructed sense based on processed information.
* Duration judgement relies on information retrieved from memory (retrospective paradigm).
* Subjective duration depends on the amount of mental content stored in memory during a time interval.

* Hypothesis: subjective estimate of psychological time is based on the quantity and density of moments of ordinary consciousness during an interval.
* Ordinary consciousness is not constant and doesn't keep up with sensory processing. We experience it as continuous due to processing and filling gaps.
* Different experiences, despite same physical duration, may have different quantities of conscious moments, leading to varying perceived durations.

* During absorption, the quantity and frequency of conscious moments are lower than in ordinary states.
* This results in a quicker passage of time feeling because there is less to recollect.

* Objection: Absorption cannot involve total absence of consciousness as we can recall its "what it is like" character.
* Response: Access consciousness arises intermittently during absorption, though with lesser frequency. We remember only these moments.
* True absorption, without access consciousness, cannot be registered by memory.

* Introspection and metacognition are attenuated during absorption.
* Assessments of time passage and the "what it is like" character of absorption occur during intermittent moments of access consciousness.

* Fewer occurrences of consciousness during absorption account for the attenuation of self-consciousness.
* Strength of absorption could be explained by the number of occurrences of consciousness, with maximal absorption resulting in total absence of conscious experience.

## 10. What Makes A State Pleasant? Absorption And Pleasure

* Absorption states are connected to pleasure and satisfaction.
* Csikszentmihalyi observed that during flow (a state of absorption), individuals don't usually feel happy because they are focused on the activity itself. Happiness is felt after exiting the flow state.
* Bronkhorst suggests that pleasure is linked to lowered bodily tension.

## The Nature of Pleasure

*  The question of what makes a state pleasant or unpleasant is debated.
* Phenomenological theories suggest that pleasure arises from a distinct feeling, but it's difficult to identify a universal "feel" across all pleasant experiences.
* Attitudinal theories propose that we like and want pleasant experiences, but they don't explain why we find them pleasurable in the first place.

## Tension, Consciousness, and Pleasure

* The strength of absorption is hypothesized to be negatively correlated with the frequency of conscious experiences.
* If absorption is pleasurable, then its strength (and therefore the absence of consciousness) should be linked to pleasure.
* Tension is often associated with unpleasantness, while relaxation is pleasant.
* This suggests that consciousness might be correlated with tension and displeasure, while its absence could be linked to relaxation and pleasure.




## 11. Tension And Self-Consciousness

* Some Western psychologists have linked tension with agency and selfhood.
* Kurt Lewin believed that wishes or intentions create tensions that drive action.
* Kurt Koffka saw the Ego as a system of tensions arising from needs and interactions with the environment.
* Bronkhorst's theory suggests tension is used by a central "main unit" of personality to control urges.

* Self-consciousness may be inherently linked to displeasure (*dukkha*) due to the strain of maintaining consciousness.
* This displeasure motivates organisms to address problematic situations and return to homeostasis.
* Ordinary self-consciousness might be constant due to language and social demands, leading to mental rehearsal and discomfort.
* The identification with one's phenomenal self-model can lead to a fear of annihilation without consciousness, perpetuating its generation.

* Bronkhorst suggests that ignorance about the true source of pleasure (absence of tension) leads to craving for objects associated with past pleasure.
* This creates a cycle where we seek conscious, introspective pleasure, which is incompatible with full absorption and prevents genuine pleasure.


## 12. The Limits Of Introspection For Self-Understanding

* Phenomenological and attitudinal theories of pleasure may be inadequate because they don't explain the underlying causes of pleasure.
* These causes might not be accessible to conscious introspection, as pleasure lies in the absence of consciousness.
* Deeper, unconscious processes may drive our behavior, while conscious experience is merely a result.

* Absorption might arise from unconscious satisfaction with the current state, rather than conscious effort.
* Skillful coping exemplifies this, where automatic processes handle needs without requiring conscious attention.
* We may not have accurate introspective knowledge of ourselves and our responses to stimuli.

## 13. Sankh ˙ Ara ¯ S, Conscious Exertion And **Dukkha**

* The paper hypothesizes that states conceptualized as *khandha*s and *vedayita* may correspond to ordinary conscious experience, which is inherently correlated with discomfort.
* This idea aligns with the Nikaya notion that the five *khandha*s or *vedayita* are *dukkha*.

* Solms's statements suggest that consciousness is undesirable from a self-organizing system's viewpoint and is correlated with uncertainty and deviation from homeostasis.
* In an ideal state, consciousness is not needed, leading to "peace at last" or Nirvana (in a general sense).

* Sariputta's statement suggests Solms may have unknowingly come close to one aspect of *nibbana* in early Buddhist thought.
* The notion of *sukha* coinciding with the absence of *vedayita* becomes less self-contradictory when considering the deep comfort experienced by an organism freed from the strain of maintaining consciousness.

* The term *sankh ˙ ara ¯*, especially in a meditative context, may convey a similar meaning to conscious exertion or volition.
* It refers to the fabricated and fabricating character of experience and is involved in generating conditioned existence.

* In some passages, *sankh ˙ ara ¯* refers to conscious intention or volition, allowing for a sense of agency and self-consciousness.
* It can also refer to the exertion and effort involved in meditative concentration.

* The term *asankh ˙ araparinibb ¯ ay¯ ¯ı* (one who attains *nibbana* without *sankh ˙ ara ¯ s) suggests that meditation can lead to a state of effortless stillness.
* The fourth *jhana* is sometimes described as a state where bodily *sankh ˙ ara ¯* are tranquilized, possibly connecting the lack of exertion with pleasure.

* While historically seen as requiring deliberate mental effort, some scholars suggest that the four *jhana*s may have been a type of spontaneous, objectless meditation.
* The Nikayas imply a link between the *jhana*s, *sukha*, the absence of *dukkha*, and the calming of *sankh ˙ ara ¯ s*.

* The Nikayas do not explicitly associate *sankh ˙ ara ¯* with bodily tension but rather with volitional striving, deliberate concentration, and forceful exertion.
* However, striving and exertion likely involve a significant amount of tension.

*  The various meanings of *sankh ˙ ara ¯* (fabrication, conditioned by ignorance, *dukkha*) may be connected.
* Consciousness might have evolved to deal with situations challenging homeostasis, but the organism mistakenly believes itself to be a conscious self and strives to maintain this illusion.


* This striving intensifies *dukkha* as it leads to further disturbances in homeostasis and generates more consciousness.

* Every instance of ordinary conscious experience involves reaching out, striving, and trying to become something different from what one really is.
* The presence of *sankh ˙ ara ¯* suggests that consciousness is artificially made up and not obligatory.

* Stilling all *sankh ˙ ara ¯ s* is identified with *nibbana*, implying the stilling of volitional striving, the ending of ordinary conscious experience, and a state where "nothing is experienced."
* Sariputta's proclamation that the essence of *nibbana*'s pleasantness lies in experiencing nothing becomes plausible in this context.

* The aged Buddha claims that only in the state of *animitta cetosamadhi* is his body more at ease, suggesting deep bodily comfort associated with the absence of conscious experience.

## 14. The Terror Of Having No Consciousness

*  The idea that consciousness is the source of misfortune clashes with common sense intuitions.
* Some believe the absence of consciousness is desirable, like a state of "zombiedom," but this view is terrifying to most people.
* The Nikaya authors acknowledge this fear but argue that realizing the impermanence and non-self nature of aggregates (aspects of consciousness) leads to liberation.

* The text suggests different interpretations of "non-being" of aggregates: final cessation, momentariness, or meditative stillness with diminished consciousness.
*  Identifying with consciousness makes its potential absence terrifying.

## 15. Are We Our Consciousness?

* The belief "I am consciousness" is questioned, as it might be generated by other cognitive elements rather than consciousness itself.
* Consciousness is presented as a passive product of unconscious processes, not the active agent responsible for our intelligence or beliefs.
* Therefore, identifying with consciousness is mistaken, similar to an AI mistaking its monitor for its own identity.
* Even if consciousness existed after death, it wouldn't be relevant to us because what fears suffering and seeks liberation is not consciousness itself but our identification with it.
* The Nikaya view of "anatta" (no-self) suggests that we are not our aggregates, including consciousness.





## 16. Conclusions: Psychological Transformation As A Radical Change Of Perspective

* An ordinary person identifies with their consciousness, while an awakened person understands that being is not limited to consciousness.
* The cessation of aggregates is terrifying for ordinary people because they see it as the destruction of their essence.
* Awakened individuals view the cessation of aggregates differently, understanding it as a change in cognitive structure.

## Notes

* This section discusses the Pali term *saññavedayitanirodha*, usually translated as "cessation of perception and feeling." The author argues for using the translation "cessation of apperception and experience" instead.

* It also mentions the difficulty in translating "Dukkha," a Pali term with no direct English equivalent, due to its complex meaning.

## SN 12.32/ii.53 & SN 56.11/v.421

* These suttas define *dukkha*, suffering, as anything that is experienced (*vedayitam*)
* The five aggregates (khandhas) are identified as the source of *dukkha*.

##  The Nature of Consciousness

* This section explores different perspectives on consciousness and argues against a binary view of consciousness as either present or absent.

* It highlights the limitations of our language in capturing the nuances of consciousness, drawing parallels with early Buddhist texts that grapple with similar issues.

* The author proposes using terms like "cognizant," "sentient," or "engaged in the world" to describe forms of consciousness beyond ordinary, introspective awareness.

## Global Availability and Consciousness

* This section explores the concept of global availability as a defining feature of consciousness, drawing on cognitive science research.

* It discusses the relationship between working memory and consciousness, suggesting that globally available representations in working memory are crucial for conscious experience.


## The Relationship Between Consciousness and the Brain

* This section emphasizes the correlation between brain activity and consciousness without claiming that the brain generates consciousness.
* It suggests that the brain creates globally available representations which correspond to conscious experiences.

## Gaps in Consciousness

* This section explores the possibility of gaps or discontinuities in consciousness, citing anecdotal evidence from meditators who report experiencing blank moments during meditation.

* The author suggests that these gaps might be indicative of a fundamental nature of consciousness that is not continuously present.




# The Attitudinal Theories of Suffering

*  These theories suggest that suffering arises from our attitudes towards physical sensations, such as wanting pleasurable feelings to continue and unpleasant ones to cease. 
* This view contrasts with Buddhist teachings that aim to dissociate physical feelings from psychological attitudes.

# A More Appropriate Pali Word for Tension

* "Vay¯ ama ¯" (effort, striving, exertion) is a better translation for "tension" than the commonly used "sankh ˙ ara ¯".
*  Both "vay¯ ama ¯" and certain contextual meanings of "sankh ˙ ara ¯" are related to effort and striving.

# The Cessation of Suffering

* Some Buddhist texts describe a state of cessation (*nirodha*) of certain feelings (*vedana¯*), which may imply its lesser depth compared to the complete cessation of perception and feeling (*saññavedayitanirodha*).
* This state is characterized by the absence of craving, aversion, and delusion.

# Consciousness and Causation

* While consciousness itself may not directly cause actions or decisions, it plays a crucial role in influencing them.
* By making data globally available to unconscious modules, consciousness indirectly shapes their activities and decisions.

# The Selflessness of Things

* The Buddhist doctrine of *anatta* (not-self) does not deny the existence of things but rather asserts that they are not inherently "mine" or "I".
* This concept applies to all aggregates, including consciousness (*viñña¯n.*a), as they are interconnected and inseparable.
