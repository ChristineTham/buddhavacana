# Absorption

* Explores the human faculty of speech and its connection to religion and culture.
* Argues that language acquisition leads humans to have two levels of cognition: symbolic and non-symbolic.
* Proposes that absorption circumvents the symbolic level, leaving only the non-symbolic level active.
* This state is akin to mystical experiences but also plays a role in ritual, mythology, and other phenomena.

# Introduction

* Acknowledges the evolutionary proximity of humans to primates.
* Highlights key differences between humans and other primates: language, culture, and religion.
* Posits that a significant event in our evolutionary past led to these unique human features.
* Aims to propose an answer to what caused this divergence. 




## ยง1 Symbolic Representation

* Two chimpanzees, Sherman and Austin, were taught to use lexigrams (symbols on a keyboard) to communicate.

* The experiment aimed to see if they could understand combinations of lexigrams as basic syntactical relationships.

* Initially, the chimps learned specific lexigram pairs (e.g., GIVE + BANANA), but struggled to grasp the general system.
* After thousands of trials, they understood that "verb" lexigrams followed by "noun" lexigrams resulted in a desired outcome. This demonstrated symbolic understanding.

* The word "symbol" is used here in a specific sense: signs that refer not only to their objects but also to each other.

* Learning symbolic reference requires understanding logical relationships between symbols, as well as the relationship between symbols and objects.
* Humans learn this naturally during childhood, while chimpanzees require extensive training.

* Symbolic representation allows for the creation of new representations even without corresponding words.

* Kanzi, a bonobo with advanced language skills, demonstrated how symbolic understanding can facilitate learning in other domains.

* Crossing the symbolic threshold opens up a world of representations that extend beyond language.
* Neurobiological research suggests that consciousness involves degenerate, context-dependent representations.




## Is

* Symbolic representation allows us to think about ourselves as characters in various scenarios, enabling self-reflection and empathy.
* It creates a sense of "self" by providing a virtual reference point for our experiences and choices.
* Symbolic representation influences our experience of the world, allowing for objectivity and moral judgment.

##  Symbolic Representation and Social Reality

* Symbolic representation objectifies immediate urges and compulsions, leading to the creation of values, institutions, and social realities.
* Language is crucial in constructing these social realities, which are real but depend on human agreement.

## Narrative Nature of Thought

* Human thought is largely narrative in nature due to symbolic representation.
* We create stories about ourselves and the world around us, shaping our perceptions and experiences.
* Symbolic representation allows for "chunking" of experience, simplifying complex realities into manageable narratives.

## Two Levels of Cognition

* Symbolic representation affects how we experience the world, creating a constructed reality alongside objective reality.
* Non-symbolic experience is essential for grounding symbolic experience in objective reality.


##  Non-Symbolic Experience

* Without symbolic representation, our experience would be similar to God's view - seeing objects based on their function rather than predefined categories.
* We wouldn't have a concept of "self," values, or expectations about the future.
* Our perception would be less filtered, encompassing more details that don't fit into existing narratives.

## Core and Extended Consciousness

* Antonio Damasio distinguishes between core consciousness (nonverbal) and extended consciousness (based on core consciousness).
* Core consciousness can exist without extended consciousness, as seen in some neurological disorders.
* Extended consciousness allows for reflection on the past and anticipation of the future, shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world.

# Core Consciousness and Extended Consciousness

* Core consciousness is a basic level of awareness where objects are perceived but without complex relationships or connections to past/future experiences.
* Extended consciousness builds upon core consciousness and relies heavily on symbolic representation.
* Symbolic representation allows for complex thought, language, and a sense of self connected to past and future.

# Mysticis M

* Mystical experiences are often described as ineffable (beyond language) and noetic (providing access to a higher reality).
* These experiences may be explained by a temporary weakening or absence of symbolic representation.
* Without the web of symbols, experience becomes more direct, immediate, and unitary.
* The sense of a separate self may dissolve in this state.

# How to Achieve Mystical Experience

* Focusing the mind is proposed as a mechanism for reducing associations that constitute symbolic representation.
* Absorption, an extreme form of focus, can lead to a non-symbolic experience characterized by reduced associations.
* This explanation accounts for both the absence of symbolic content and the timeless nature of some mystical experiences.

## ยง3 Ritual

* Ritual formulas often lack meaning in the ordinary sense.
* They are holophrastic, like holistic phrases in everyday language but more so.
* Unlike ordinary formulas, ritual formulas don't pretend to have linguistic meaning and directly perform a function.
* Ritual formulas resemble pre-symbolic utterances, aiming for immediacy of experience rather than symbolic representation.

* Ritual actions are also holistic, divorced from usual goals and not guided by symbolic representation like ordinary activity.
* They aim to reach a "higher" reality beyond the realm of symbolic representation.
* While altered states of consciousness can accompany ritual, it's not necessarily the sole reason for its existence.
* Even those unfamiliar with mystical experiences may intuitively sense the existence of a world beyond symbolic representation.




# Implicit Awareness

* Ritualistic utterances and activities across cultures suggest a shared awareness of the process leading to symbolic cognition.
* This awareness stems from the division of an initially undivided cognition.
* The existence of ritual implies a conscious effort to access a deeper reality beyond ordinary experience.

# Grounding in Reality

* Humans possess an inherent knowledge that ordinary experience is incomplete and seek a "higher" reality for well-being.
* Rituals, free from symbolic reference, aim to reconnect with this real world and escape the potential deceit of symbolic representation.
* The Yanomamo Indians' peace ritual exemplifies how ritual grounds interactions in reality, preventing violence.

# Mythology And Religion

* Symbolic reference creates a barrier between humans and direct experience of reality, leading some to seek a more immediate connection through mysticism or rituals.
* Creation myths reflect the implicit awareness of a higher reality from which our world emerged.
* The transition from an undivided to a divided world occurs not at the beginning of time but during childhood when symbolic cognition develops.

# Symbolic Reference and Human Experience

* Symbolic representation profoundly shapes human experience, distinguishing us from other animals.
* It fosters the belief in a "deeper" reality, leading to rituals and specific thought patterns.
* The significance of symbolic reference extends beyond language and potentially influences other aspects of human activity, such as culture. 




## ยง5 Culture

* The faculty for symbolic representation is not limited to language and can be seen in sign languages.
* This faculty allows children to learn language by associating sounds or gestures with objects and then understanding relationships between these signs.
* Children also apply this faculty to non-linguistic "signs" in their environment, learning the system of relationships established by their culture.

* This leads to a "web" of non-linguistic signs that varies across cultures, shaping individuals' understanding of the world. 
* The Christmas tree example illustrates how cultural symbols can evoke complex webs of associations specific to a particular culture.

* Like language, culture can influence cognition, with evidence suggesting that members of different cultures perceive and understand the world differently.
* Both linguistic and cultural "webs" can be transcended through states of absorption, potentially leading to experiences free from cultural superimpositions.


* The capacity for symbolic representation underlies both language and culture, allowing us to identify signs, understand their relationships, and construct complex systems of meaning. 


## 47 Appendix 1: Se Mantic Etymologies55

* Symbolic reference is essential for language learning and allows us to extract words from larger utterances.
* Humans may push symbolic reference beyond the level useful in daily life, leading to semantic etymologizing.
* Semantic etymologies connect one word with others believed to elucidate its meaning, unlike historical etymologies which trace a word's origin.

## APPENDIX 2: SYMBOLIC REFERENCE AND THE O RIGIN OF LANGUAGE

* The origin of language is a debated topic involving various disciplines like biology, neurology, and linguistics.
* Language evolution (biological) is distinct from changes in languages (cultural).
* Protolanguage, the precursor to language, is thought to have been largely structureless with a limited vocabulary but lacking sophisticated phonology and structure.
* An alternative theory proposes that protolanguage was holophrastic, meaning it consisted of single words expressing complete thoughts. 




## The Holophrastic Model of Protolanguage

* This proposal suggests that protolanguage consisted of holophrases rather than individual words.
* Alison Wray argues that protolanguage began as a system of holophrases, which were then segmented based on phonetic similarities due to memory overload.

## Bickerton's Criticism of the Holophrastic Model

* Bickerton challenges Wray's example, arguing that the proposed segmentation process is unlikely and would lead to inconsistencies.
* He suggests that if a sound like "rna" consistently appeared in holophrases related to female beneficiaries, it wouldn't necessarily indicate a specific meaning for "female beneficiary."
* Bickerton cites his own work and Maggie Tallerman's contributions as further arguments against the holophrastic model.

## Wray & Grace's Defense of the Holophrastic Model

* They propose that early language users possessed the capacity to segment existing message units, leading to the emergence of words.
* This segmentation ability was likely a biological mutation and not simply a cultural development.
* They argue that all members of the group could learn new utterances, even those without the segmentation capacity.

## Mithen's Response to Criticisms

* He argues that criticisms against Wray's model lack substance and are based on misunderstandings.
* Mithen cites computer simulations supporting the feasibility of chance associations in segmentation.
* He points out that lengthy holistic phrases exist in other species, suggesting that human protolanguage could have been similarly complex.


## Consequences of the Holophrastic Model

* Wray & Grace suggest that a "peripheral capacity" for dissecting language beyond immediate communicative needs is central to this model.
* They argue that this capacity explains why individuals sometimes analyze language in unconventional ways (e.g., wondering about the meaning of "done" in "how do you do?").
* The existence of semantic etymologies, where people try to trace word origins back to their perceived meanings, supports the idea of a proclivity for dissecting language.

# Bickerton's Criticism

* Bickerton argues against a holophrastic protolanguage by pointing out the ambiguity of single syllables like "ma."
* He suggests that if "ma" only refers to female beneficiaries, it would be redundant.
* If "ma" has other meanings, how would listeners know when it refers to a female beneficiary?

# Socrates' Analysis

* Socrates, in Plato's Cratylus, discusses the difficulties of semantic etymologizing.
* He compares extracting meaning from syllables to assigning meanings to letters based on their perceived qualities.
* Socrates acknowledges the limitations of this approach and suggests that convention plays a role in establishing word meanings.

# Isidore of Seville's Etymologies

* Isidore, a 6th-century scholar, provides examples of semantic etymologies based on rationale, origin, or contrast.
* He connects words like "king" to "acting correctly" and "mud" to "washing."
* Despite the potential for ambiguity and inconsistency, Isidore continues this practice.

# Johansson's Criticism

* Sverker Johansson criticizes the idea of a holophrastic protolanguage, arguing that segmentation requires pre-existing structure.
* He compares it to children learning language, who rely on the internal structure provided by adults.

# The Proclivity for Segmentation

* Despite criticisms, humans have a tendency to segment and assign meanings even in inconsistent material.
* This proclivity supports the possibility of a holophrastic protolanguage where segmentation emerges without pre-existing structure.

# Crossing the Symbolic Threshold

* The transition from holistic communication to segmentation may be linked to crossing the symbolic threshold.
* Symbolic reference allows for both segmentation and imposes constraints on the combination of segments, potentially explaining some syntactic rules.





# Introduction

* This study explores the implications of certain central claims found in early Buddhist texts for psychological theory. 
* It treats these claims as a working hypothesis, assuming their truth and investigating their consequences.
* The focus is on understanding the human psyche through this lens, not on proving or disproving the historical accuracy of the Buddhist tradition.

#  The Working Hypothesis

* The study accepts as true the central claims of early Buddhist texts regarding the possibility of ending desire and suffering. 
* It acknowledges that these claims may seem unusual from a common-sense perspective but argues that they should be taken seriously as potential sources of insight into the human mind.
* It distinguishes between historical accounts of the Buddha's life and the core teachings preserved in the texts, focusing on the latter.

# The Nature of Suffering and Desire

* The study highlights the Buddhist concept of suffering (dukkha) as a central theme in the early texts. 
* It emphasizes that the end of suffering refers primarily to psychological suffering, although it may also have implications for bodily suffering.
* Desire (tanhฤ), often referred to as "thirst," is identified as the root cause of suffering and therefore needs to be eradicated.

# The Path to Liberation

* The study outlines the Four Noble Truths, which describe the nature of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.
* It emphasizes that the Buddhist tradition presents a conscious and enduring state free from suffering and desire as the ultimate goal.

# Theoretical Framework

* The study recognizes the limitations of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology in fully explaining the Buddhist perspective on liberation. 
* It calls for a psychological theory that incorporates experiential elements and can account for the functional relationships between them.

# Neuroscience and Evolutionary Psychology

* Neuroscience alone cannot explain the Buddhist claim of eliminating desire.
* Knowing the neuro-physiological correlates of the process and its result will not provide us with the understanding we are looking for.
* Evolutionary psychology can only be of marginal use as eliminating desire does not offer evolutionary advantages.

# The Need for a New Theory

* We need a theory that incorporates experiential terms, especially desire, to understand the Buddhist claims.
* This theory should allow discussion about the eradication of desire without necessarily reducing it to neurophysiological processes.
* Such a theory would circumvent the issue of free will.

# Freudian Psychoanalysis as a Starting Point

* Freud's psychoanalytic theory is one of the few that incorporates experiential terms and could be adapted for our purpose.
* The sexual instinct in Freudian theory can be confronted with the Buddhist claim of eliminating all desire, including sexual desire.
* This confrontation shows promise because it directly addresses the core of Freudian theory, which traditionally has been difficult to access.

# Criticisms of Freudian Theory and Potential Solutions

* Freudian theory has been criticized for being unfalsifiable, but this is refuted by the Buddhist texts which contradict its claim about the inborn nature of sexual instinct.
* The concept of sublimation in Freudian theory is problematic if sexual energy is biologically rooted and cannot be redirected.
* While some criticize Freudian theory for being "positivist" and "empiricist," this paper argues that falsifiability is a virtue in a psychological theory, allowing it to be tested and potentially replaced by better ones.

# Contrasting Views on the Nature of Psychological Theories

* Thomas Nagel believes theories like the one we are looking for can only offer a generalized "feeling into" experiences.
* Eric R. Kandel, on the other hand, argues that neuroscience can ultimately explain mental causation and consciousness.

# Outline Of A Psychological Theory
* Human behavior is influenced by earlier experiences.
* Pleasurable experiences leave traces in the mind which can be activated by similar objects or events.
* Activated memory traces evoke bodily states associated with the original pleasurable experience.
* The mind can be seen as a collection of memory traces, each linked to specific bodily states.

## ยงL Funda Mentals
* Memory traces and their corresponding bodily arousal form a partial map of the world. 




## 95 Seen As An Embodiment Of The "Belief" That The Object Or Event

* Physicomental maps are crucial for understanding memory and learning beyond simple stimulus-response associations.
* Animals can form cognitive maps, use strategies, and create concepts, demonstrating the limitations of purely behavioral explanations.
* Internal representations of mental events are essential for understanding behavior in both humans and animals.

## Integrated Traces: A Foundation for Reality Assessment

* Memory traces integrate to form trace units, which provide a better reality assessment than individual traces. 
* Trace units guide bodily arousal towards pleasurable experiences based on learned associations.
* The example of a baby's hunger illustrates how integrated memory traces lead to more sophisticated understanding and goal-directed behavior.

## Urges, Satisfaction, and Homeostasis

* Urges are linked to memory traces that determine their direction based on the "belief" of satisfaction.
* After integration, urges are still present but their direction is determined by the trace unit as a whole.
* Independent urges can push for satisfaction without prior activation of associated memory traces.
* Dependent urges require activation of their memory traces or chance occurrences for manifestation.

## The Main Unit and Attention

* The main unit is the largest trace unit, encompassing most memory traces and guiding an individual's urges.
* Attention plays a crucial role in selecting courses of action from multiple possibilities presented by the main unit.
* Attention can be directed at sensory input or selected memory traces, excluding other potential activations.




# Selective Activation of Memory Traces

*  Selective activation of memory traces by attention excites different urges to varying degrees.
* This differential excitation allows selected urges (associated with selected memory traces) to counterbalance other excited urges using bodily tension.

# The Activity of the Main Unit

* The main unit's activity is not solely reactive; memories and fantasies can also activate memory traces.
* The main unit anticipates future events by constructing numerous memories and fantasies, aided by its symbolic representation capacity.
* Attention directed at these memories or fantasies activates the corresponding traces similarly to unmediated confrontation with external objects or events, though usually to a lesser degree.

# Avoidance of Dangerous Traces

* Sometimes, memory traces are definitively discarded due to their associated urges being strongly opposed to the main unit's goals.
* This involves forcefully mobilizing free tension. Attention plays a key role by raising the excitation level of the threatening urge when directed at the dangerous trace.
* To avoid this, attention must be withdrawn from the dangerous trace and directed towards other traces or external objects, potentially leading to symptom formation through associative connections.

# The Fate of Dangerous Traces

* This avoidance process results in denial and avoidance of anything that might activate the dangerous trace. 
* The full content of the dangerous trace remains "unknown" as it is not integrated into the main unit.
* Since urges are directed by their associated traces, the threatening urge persists even if its trace aims for unattainable satisfaction.

# Reality Assessments and Threatening Urges

* This fate isn't limited to primary memory traces; larger trace units with conflicting reality assessments (beliefs about satisfaction possibilities) also face exclusion.
* Even dangerous memory traces may not be integrated due to the main unit "remembering" the danger narrowly escaped. 
* The negative experience associated with this confrontation leaves a signpost, leading to avoidance of similar experiences in the future.

# Unpleasure and Consciousness


* Confrontations with unacceptable traces and urges cause unpleasure because they lead to high bodily tension without discharge (satisfaction).
* Attention and consciousness are often linked, though not always. Mental contents at which attention is directed tend to be conscious.
* Some non-conscious mental contents can become conscious through attention.

# Conscious and Unconscious Contents

* There are two main categories of mental contents: those accessible to consciousness and those resistant to it.
* The difference lies in their reality assessments: conscious contents belong to the main unit, shaped by numerous experiences, while unconscious contents have stunted development based on limited experiences.

# Comparison with Freudian Ideas

* This theory shares similarities with Freudian concepts like the conscious and unconscious (Ego and Id) and repression. 
* However, it omits many aspects of Freudian psychology and differs in its emphasis on attention, which plays a crucial role in repression in this theory.


# Neurological Findings

* The theory aligns with some neurological findings regarding consciousness.
* Researchers suggest that consciousness arises from globally integrative processes involving interactions between multiple brain systems, particularly the thalamus, brainstem, and cortex.
* Edelman and Tononi propose the "dynamic core" concept, a cluster of interacting neuronal groups responsible for conscious experience.

# Splinter Cores and the Unconscious

* They also acknowledge the existence of "splinter cores," isolated neuronal groups potentially underlying aspects of the unconscious.
* These splinter cores may correspond to the isolated trace units in our theory, though further research is needed to clarify their role.

## Iii

* The text discusses the relationship between psychological theory and neuroscience, specifically regarding the concept of the unconscious.
* It presents various perspectives on the compatibility of Freudian psychoanalysis and neuroscientific findings.
* Some authors argue for a distinction between "cognitive" and "thymic" (affective) unconsciousness, while others see potential connections between Freudian concepts and brain structures like the amygdala.

## ยง3 Psychotherapy And Its Obstacles

* Repressed memory traces can interfere with an individual's well-being by creating conflicting urges that compete with the main unit's activity.
* This interference can manifest as discomfort or behavioral issues, leading individuals to seek psychotherapy.
* Psychotherapy aims to integrate repressed units into the main unit, reducing their disruptive influence.
* This integration process requires accessing and processing the emotional charges associated with repressed memory traces.

## 1 1 8

* The success of psychoanalysis and related therapies is hindered by the strength of repressed urges and the level of tension used by the main unit (ego) to counter them.
* Ideal therapeutic environments, like the Freudian couch, provide a safe space with minimal stimuli that can activate repressed memory traces. This lowers the overall tension level, allowing for the integration of repressed traces into the main unit without triggering threatening activity.

* Sometimes, patients and therapists may mistake newly created fantasies for recovered repressed memories. These fantasies lack the emotional charge of true repressed memories and therefore have no therapeutic effect.
* There can be intermediate cases where a newly constructed fantasy partially incorporates elements of the repressed memory trace, leading to partial therapeutic success.

* The reconstruction of episodic memories further complicates the process of recovering repressed memories. 
* Even if a repressed memory is truly recovered and its associated urge diverted, the disruption of the delicate equilibrium between various memory traces can lead to the re-emergence of other repressed urges.

* The system may resist changes to this equilibrium by repressing the newly integrated trace, effectively undoing the therapeutic progress.

# ยง4 A "Co Mplete Cure"

* Our investigation into the human mind suggests that a complete psychotherapeutic cure would involve fully integrating all repressed memories into the main unit of consciousness.

* This integration is usually prevented by the repression of certain memories, which involves the main unit using tension to counteract the discharge of associated urges.
* Identifying and confronting these urges directly, rather than relying on reconstructing repressed memories, could be a more effective approach.


#  Requirements for a Complete Psychotherapeutic Cure

* **Reduced Tension:** A complete cure would require minimizing bodily tension. This means avoiding situations that raise tension levels, such as anticipating the future or interacting with others. Ideally, the patient should be alone and avoid all external stimuli.
* **Direct Identification of Urges:** A method is needed to directly identify urges without relying on knowing the associated repressed memories. This could involve observing private manifestations of urges during activities performed without conscious awareness.

* **Rapid Cure in One Session:** To prevent relapse, a complete cure should be achieved as quickly as possible, ideally in a single session. This would establish a new and more stable equilibrium within the mind. 




# The Theory Adapted
* A complete psychotherapeutic cure assumes conflict is not inherent in the human mind, contradicting Freud's view.
* Two types of urges exist: independent (e.g., hunger) and dependent (activated by memory traces).

* Dependent urges are shaped by past experiences and lack a fixed aim.

# Sexuality
* Sexuality manifests in diverse forms, making its nature difficult to define.
* Childhood experiences heavily influence adult sexuality.
* Freud believed the sexual urge is composed of various factors that combine into a unified drive during maturation.

* He acknowledged the commonality of sensory excitation from erotogenic zones but couldn't identify a unifying essence of sexuality.
* The connection between concentration and sexual excitation, as noted by Freud, suggests a potential key to understanding urges.




## #141 ยง6 The Theory Refined

* Concentration can be pleasurable because it reduces bodily tension.
* Deactivation of memory traces during concentration lowers the excitation of associated urges, leading to reduced overall bodily tension and pleasure.
* Not all concentration is pleasurable; increased excitation of selected memory traces can raise overall bodily tension.
* Tasks requiring concentration but lacking inspiration may necessitate additional bodily tension, resulting in displeasure.

##  

* Absorption is intense concentration accompanied by reduced overall bodily tension.
* Absorption can be pleasurable because it reduces bodily tension without exciting urges.
* Memory traces primarily record objects and events associated with satisfaction, not states of absorption.
* "Signless" absorption lacks a "sign" for memory recall due to its lack of association with specific objects or events.

##  

* Voluntary absorption is difficult to achieve because accumulated memory traces and concerns occupy available bodily tension.
* Buddhist preparatory practices aim to facilitate access to pleasure through "signless absorption."
* Diffuse bodily tension accompanies wakefulness and can be reduced by absorption, leading to pleasure.
* Most concentration in adults requires additional bodily tension due to pre-existing commitments of tension to tasks and urges.

##  

* Many pleasurable situations are experienced in a state of absorption due to the reduction in bodily tension it provides.
* The source of pleasure in these cases is the state of absorption, not the situation itself.
* This can lead to misguided pursuits, as individuals may seek to repeat situations associated with past pleasure even if those situations were not the true cause of satisfaction.

##  

* Buddhist texts present absorption as a source of pleasure, distinguishing between "rapture and pleasure born of seclusion" (reduction of tension without absorption) and "rapture and pleasure born of absorption" (further reduction through absorption).
* "Sensual pleasures" are those obtained through activated memory traces, while "pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states" is derived directly from seclusion and absorption.

## ยง7 Sexuality And Sublimation

* This section explores how certain urges, termed "dependent" urges, can be explained by the theory presented.
* It aims to shed light on various behaviors, including sexual behavior, by examining how they relate to reducing bodily tension.
* The text acknowledges the role of hereditary factors in shaping individual inclinations and predispositions.

##  

* This section discusses the limits of environmental conditioning in relation to psychotherapies and Buddhist practices.
* It suggests that while deconditioning can be effective, there may be certain hereditary factors that resist it.
* The focus is on understanding why reducing bodily tension often leads to sexual behavior.

## 


* This section explores the connection between bodily sensations, pleasure, and sexual behavior.
* It posits that areas with a high concentration of sensory nerves, like the genitals, become focal points for attention due to their potential for intense pleasure.
* The text acknowledges the role of neurochemicals like opioids in generating pleasure during sexual activity.

## 


* This section examines the broader question of why reducing bodily tension leads to various activities, including those classified as sublimation.
* It proposes that activities are driven by memory traces associated with past experiences of satisfaction.
* The text emphasizes that continued satisfaction is crucial for maintaining these memory traces and influencing future behavior.

## 


* This section delves into the nature of sublimated activities and the pleasure they provide.
* It suggests that even activities not directly related to sexual gratification can reduce bodily tension and induce a state of absorption, leading to pleasure.
* The text uses the example of music lovers experiencing pleasure from listening to their favorite composer, attributing it to the music's ability to induce a state of absorption and reduce bodily tension.

## # Earlier Experience and Pleasure

* The mind is drawn to past experiences of satisfaction due to the memory traces they leave behind.
* Greater remembered satisfaction leads to deeper attention and absorption.
* Absorption reduces bodily tension, producing pleasure.
* This pleasure is not directly from the music or activity itself but from the state of absorption it induces.

## # Proust's Madeleines

* Marcel Proust's experience with madeleines demonstrates that present pleasure can be triggered by memories even if the original event was not particularly pleasurable.
* The memory trace associated with the madeleine evokes a sense of deep satisfaction and nostalgia, surpassing the actual sensory experience.
* This suggests that present pleasure is not simply a transfer of past pleasure but a result of the reinterpretation and absorption triggered by the memory.

## # The Result Of A "Complete Cure"

* A "complete cure" involves integrating repressed memories and redirecting urges while also changing the mind's assessment of those memories.
* Instead of seeking to recreate past experiences, the individual will aim for states of reduced bodily tension directly.
* This leads to the absence of sexual desire and attachment to objects or people.

## # Pleasure and the Brain

* Pleasure is experienced when bodily tension is reduced, not as a constant state.
* A "complete cure" would result in a state of permanent mental peace rather than continuous bliss.
* While neurological changes likely accompany this transformation, they may be subtle and difficult to detect with current technology.
* The theory suggests that the Buddha's brain might lack "splinter cores," indicating complete integration of unconscious elements into the dynamic core.

## # Summary

* The mind seeks pleasure based on memories of past experiences, but it doesn't understand the true nature of pleasure (discharge of bodily tension).
* This can lead to a cycle of seeking to recreate situations that may not actually be pleasurable.
* A "complete cure" would involve understanding this mechanism and directly accessing states of low tension, leading to freedom from desire.

# The Nature of Pleasure

* This section discusses a theory about the nature of pleasure, drawing parallels between Buddhist teachings and modern psychological concepts.
* It proposes that pleasure arises from a reduction in bodily tension, which is influenced by memory traces associated with past experiences.
* Two primary methods for achieving pleasure are identified: social isolation to minimize external sources of tension and mental absorption to redirect attention away from tension-inducing thoughts.

# Trace Units and Bodily Tension

* This section delves into the mechanics of how memory traces, organized into "trace units," influence bodily tension and associated urges.
* It explains that trace units represent learned associations between experiences and pleasure/displeasure, guiding our motivations and desires.
* The theory suggests that attention plays a crucial role in regulating tension by influencing the activation of these trace units.

# Repression and Integration

* This section explores the concept of "repression," where conflicting urges are suppressed due to limited bodily tension resources. 
* It describes how repressed memory traces can be accessed through techniques like social isolation and absorption, which reduce overall tension.
* The theory proposes that successful integration of repressed trace units into the main unit leads to a more balanced mental state.

# Testability of the Theory

* This section acknowledges the need for empirical validation of the proposed theory. 
* It outlines several testable assumptions and consequences of the theory, inviting researchers to investigate them through experiments.
* The author suggests exploring the relationship between attention, bodily tension, absorption, and the role of memory traces in shaping motivation.

# Further Theoretical Considerations

* This section raises further questions about the nature of reality assessment by trace units and the connection between feelings and actions. 
* It encourages future research to explore these complex issues and refine the understanding of pleasure and motivation.

# Pleasure Mechanisms: Opioids and Dopamine

* This section draws connections between the proposed theory and neurochemical mechanisms underlying pleasure, specifically opioids and dopamine.
* It suggests that opioid systems might be related to the "quieting" effect observed in states of deep relaxation or satisfaction. 
* Dopamine is proposed to be associated with a more active form of desire or reward-seeking urge rather than direct consummatory pleasure.

# Panksepp, 2006: 1 83-84)

* There are at least two types of positive affect (PA) states in the brain.
* An appetitive PA system is linked to reward-seeking and involves dopamine in the ventral striatum.
* A separate PA system processes sensory pleasure and involves opiates and GABA in the ventral striatum and orbital frontal cortex.

# The Sexual Instinct

* Human beings, as biological organisms, are products of evolution driven by natural selection.
*  A "sexual instinct" seems necessary for procreation.
* The theory presented suggests humans lack a clear, goal-oriented sexual instinct.

# The Evolutionary Advantage

* Despite the lack of a clear sexual instinct, human reproduction is not significantly affected.
* The absence of an exclusively sexual instinct allows for diverse motivations and activities, including "perversions" and sublimation.
* This flexibility may have contributed to human cultural development and survival.

# Testing the Theory

* The theory is open to experimental testing.
* Its value should be evaluated based on empirical evidence.
* Even if valuable, the working hypothesis can be discarded once it has served its purpose.

# APPENDIX 1: THE MAIN TEXTS WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMENTARY

* This appendix presents key passages from Pali Buddhist texts that support the positions attributed to them.
* Translations have been adjusted for clarity and consistency.

## ยงL The Path Of Liberation As A'Whole

* This section describes the effect of a Buddha's teaching on an ideal follower.
* It outlines the path to liberation through various stages: renunciation, ethical conduct, mindfulness, and meditation.

## ยง3 Absorption


* Absorption is crucial in the later stages of the path to liberation.
* It withdraws attention from habitual tasks, including resisting repressed urges.
* This allows for dealing with those urges directly.

## ยง2 Guiding One'S Thoughts

* The Buddha trained himself to focus on thoughts of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-cruelty rather than thoughts of sensual desire, ill will, and cruelty.
* He understood that the former class of thoughts did not lead to affliction, aided wisdom, and led to Nibbana, while the latter class did the opposite. 
* Whatever a monk frequently thinks about becomes the inclination of his mind.

## ยง3 Avoiding Hunger

* While some urges only arise when their corresponding memory traces are activated, others like hunger can manifest independently.
* Practitioners aiming to reduce excitation of urges may not easily succeed in removing hunger through mental means and might need to appease it by eating.
* The Buddha himself initially tried methods including abstinence from food but ultimately found enlightenment after resuming eating and ending painful practices.

## ยง4 Awareness

* Practitioners must practice awareness during daily activities and sitting meditation. 
* This involves understanding one's current posture or action, such as walking, standing, sitting, or lying down.

## 1 89 ยง5 Mindfulness

* Mindfulness is crucial for liberation and involves contemplating the body, feelings, mind, and mind-objects.
* Practitioners should be ardent, fully aware, and mindful while observing these elements.
* Mindfulness helps locate repressed urges by bringing them into conscious awareness through associated feelings.

## ยง6 Fear Of Being Alone

* Fear, especially at night, can be a challenge for solitary practitioners.
* The Buddha-to-be faced this fear by dwelling in secluded places on auspicious nights.
* He learned to subdue fear and dread without succumbing to panic or changing his posture.
* This passage highlights the importance of confronting fears rather than avoiding them.
* Concentration is key to preventing fear from overwhelming the practitioner.
* Avoiding anticipation of the future helps reduce bodily tension and achieve a "complete psychotherapeutic cure."

## ยง7 Who Succeed S ?

* The Buddha explains to a brahmin that not all his disciples reach Nibbana (ultimate goal) even though he provides instructions.
* He compares this to a guide showing the way to Rajagaha; some people follow the directions and arrive, while others take the wrong path.
*  The Buddha concludes that he is like the guide, showing the way to Nibbana, but not everyone succeeds in reaching it.

## ยง8 The Liberated Person

* The Buddha was believed to be free from psychological suffering but not physical suffering.
* His approaching death is described as his body being "strapped up" and only finding comfort through entering a signless-absorption-of-mind.
* This suggests that withdrawal of attention from sensory input, including pain, can alleviate physical suffering.
* The Buddha often spent afternoons in seclusion, sometimes in absorption, indicating a practice of mental focus for relief.

## APPENDIX 2: ABSORPTION AND PLEASURE IN MYSTICISM AND MEDITATION

* Mystical and meditative experiences often involve both states of deep absorption and feelings of joy, rapture, or ecstasy.
* While these positive emotions are frequently reported, some researchers emphasize the knowledge gained in these states as more significant.
* Abraham Maslow studied "peak-experiences" characterized by intense concentration and often accompanied by joy, rapture, and bliss.
* Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's research on "flow experience" highlights the role of focused attention in achieving enjoyment and forgetting worries.
* B. Alan Wallace emphasizes the importance of attention in Buddhist meditative states, leading to experiences of physical and mental bliss. 




# The Link Between Concentration and Joy

* This section explores the connection between concentration (absorption) and joy (bliss, rapture).
* It cites various authors like Wallace, Underhill, Laski, and Goodman who discuss ecstatic states and their relation to concentration.
*  The text suggests that deep concentration can lead to experiences of joy and ecstasy.

# Appendix 3: Psychology And Free Will

* This appendix discusses the problem of free will in the context of a psychological theory that incorporates experiential terms.
* It argues that using such a theory allows us to avoid the debate about determinism and free will.
* The text mentions different perspectives on free will, including those of James, Wegner, and others who see conscious will as an illusion or epiphenomenon. 
* It criticizes Wegner's position, arguing that his exclusion of conscious activities from the causal chain leads to the conclusion that all decisions are illusory.

## 2Lo

*  Experiences like pleasure and pain don't directly influence behavior, contradicting the evolutionary idea that they lead to rewards.
* Including experiential elements in psychology resolves this contradiction because decisions become part of the causal chains being studied.
* Determinism doesn't prevent "free" choices from having causal efficacy; they are determined by prior events but still feel "real."

* Introducing conscious experiences as functional elements in psychology, rather than epiphenomena, requires moving beyond purely physical and chemical explanations.
* This approach is similar to evolutionary biology, which considers phenotypes alongside genotypes for a complete understanding.
* Recognizing the functional role of conscious experience in psychology helps address the problem of free will.

* The table provides Sanskrit and Pali equivalents for technical terms related to Buddhism. 
* Abbreviations used in the text are defined.
