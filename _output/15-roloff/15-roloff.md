# About This Volume

* Carola Roloff's monograph presents a critical edition and English translation of key chapters from the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya concerning nuns' ordination.
* The author argues that these texts support the re-establishment of the Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī lineage, addressing the debate surrounding full ordination for women in Tibetan Buddhism.
* This study provides a solid foundation for future discussions on this important topic by grounding arguments in the canonical text itself.

## 1 Introduction 
* This publication examines the rituals and regulations for full ordination of Buddhist nuns according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda Buddhist monastic code.
* The aim is to explore the possibility of granting full ordination to women in Tibetan Buddhism based on this code.
* The research project involved a critical edition and annotated English translation of key texts related to nuns' ordination found in the Kṣudrakavastu of the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya.

## 1.2 Primary Sources
* This section focuses on the Tibetan translation of the Kṣudrakavastu, which contains important texts related to nuns' ordination.
* It highlights the significance of this specific Vinaya text for understanding the historical context and practices surrounding nuns' ordination in Tibetan Buddhism.

## Terminology Utilized

* The *Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya* (MSV) is considered to be a relatively young Vinaya rendition.
* It contains early material, and manuscript fragments from the sixth or seventh centuries exist.
* The Tibetan translation of the Kṣ*udrakavastu* comprises two volumes of the Kanjur.

## 1.2.2 Principal Texts Considered

* A Sanskrit parallel exists for portions of the Tibetan *Bhikṣuṇīkarmavācanā*.
* This fragment is catalogued as a manuscript (Sanskrit ms. c.25(R)) in the Bodleian Library Oxford.
* The manuscript likely originates from Nepal and dates back to the 11th century.

##  The Evolution of the First *bhikṣuṇī* Ordination


* This study analyzes 13 different Kanjur editions of the Tibetan translation of the *Bhikṣuṇīkarmavācanā*.
* It compares these with a Sanskrit fragment (ms. c.25(R)) and Chinese translations.
* The study includes an annotated English translation of the Tibetan *Bhikṣuṇīkarmavācanā*, specifically the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* and the *Manual for Buddhist Nuns' Ordination*.

##  Comparison with Other Texts


* Comparisons are made between the *Manual for Buddhist Nuns' Ordination* and the *Manual for Buddhist Monks' Ordination* in the MSV.
* Tibetan translations of Indian Vinaya commentaries, particularly Guṇaprabha's *Ekottarakarmaśataka*, were consulted.
* The *Ekottarakarmaśataka* is considered a paraphrased reproduction of the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti*.

## Chinese Translations

* A Chinese translation of the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* exists in T. 1451[24].
* The parallel to the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti* in the *Ekottarakarmaśataka* is found in T. 1453.
* The *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* lacks a direct equivalent in the Chinese MSV, but there are content correspondences with the Chinese *Ekottarakarmaśataka*.

## 1.2.3 Introduction To The Tibetan Text Edition

* This project began in January 2010 with extensive Kanjur material and concordance compilation.
* Analysis of *Bhikṣuṇīvastu*, including a literature survey on critical editions of Vinaya texts, was conducted.
* New materials like the Tokyo manuscript and Shey manuscript were incorporated.

* Thirteen Kanjur editions were selected for collation based on an unpublished draft by Jin-il Chung.
* The apparatus was reconfigured as a positive apparatus to clearly show textual witnesses and relationships.
* Inclusion of further Kanjur editions proved beneficial in classifying lesser-known editions.

* Seven Kanjur editions were chosen for the critical edition, representing both main traditions and later editions suitable for clarification.
* Mr. Eimer's stemma proved accurate, negating the need for a new one.
* The text edition prioritizes content, language, and textual criticism, considering both Tibetan and Sanskrit sources.

* The aim is to reproduce the text faithfully in a legible form, with separate publication in Tibetan script alongside Sanskrit Devanāgarī script.
* Readings from both main traditions are included, along with the Derge edition for its unique perspective.
* Excessive divergence among Kanjur editions and the Sanskrit text regarding obstructive conditions led to a concordance table and consolidated list of questions.

##  Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu and Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti

* The *Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* narrates the first bhikṣuṇī ordination, while the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti* outlines procedures for subsequent ordinations.
* The Tibetan text only establishes a bhikṣuṇī saṃgha after the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadājñapti*.

* The *Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* is found in specific sections of thirteen Kanjur editions, with forward slash indicating the end of Part One and beginning of Part Two.
* For comparison, the *Las brgya rtsa gcig pa* (*Ekottarakarmaśataka*) from the *Tanjur* is included in Part Two.
* Parallels to the Chinese MSV translation are provided for both chapters.

## 2 The First Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

* This chapter studies the narrative of the first ordination of a woman and related events concerning ordained women within the Buddhist community as recounted in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda *vinaya*.
* This presentation is compared with Sanskrit and Chinese Mūlasarvāstivāda parallels.

## 2.1 The First Bhikṣuṇī Saṃgha And The Evolution Of The Manual For Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

* The history of the *bhikṣuṇī* order begins with Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's request and eventual permission to become a nun.
* It describes how she became a *bhikṣuṇī* by accepting the eight gurudharmas.
* While different Vinayas agree on these initial points, they show some differences in describing subsequent events regarding the ordination of women accompanying her.

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda version is presented based on a critical edition of the Tibetan text and Schmidt's re-edition of the Sanskrit manuscript.
* This is followed by an English translation of the Tibetan texts with an annotated analysis and discussion of its significance.

## Summary (Tib. Sdom Ni, Skt. Uddāna) 1

* Spoiled by mildew and confirmation of thorough interrogation by a *bhikṣuṇī*.
* Legal proceedings to be conducted; a *bhikṣuṇī* who left the order.

# I.1 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Request For Admission To The Order

* The Buddha, staying in Kapilavastu, is visited by Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and 500 women of the Śākya clan.
* She requests permission to ordain as a *bhikṣuṇī*, arguing that women are capable of attaining enlightenment.
* The Buddha rejects her request three times, advising her to lead a pure life at home instead.

* Ānanda pleads with the Buddha to allow women to ordain.
* The Buddha refuses, explaining that if women join the order, it will not last long.

* The Buddha acknowledged Mahāprajāpatī's kindness in raising him but stated that he had already repaid her by allowing her to attain enlightenment.
* He believed this act of kindness was more valuable than material gifts.

## I.3.3.3 Purpose Of The Eight Gurudharmas

* The Buddha established eight *gurudharma*s (rules) for nuns to maintain order and prevent misconduct.
* These rules are compared to a dam that controls water, preventing it from overflowing.

## I.3.4 The Eight Gurudharmas

* **First Gurudharma:** Nuns should understand they have attained bhikṣuṇīhood after receiving ordination from monks.
* **Second Gurudharma:** Nuns should seek instruction from monks every half month.
* **Third Gurudharma:** Nuns should not enter the rainy-season retreat in a residence without monks present.
* **Fourth Gurudharma:** Nuns should perform the *pravāraṇā* ceremony (confession) at the end of the rainy season, reporting any wrongdoings they witnessed or suspected.
* **Fifth Gurudharma:** Nuns should not criticize or remind monks of their faults.

* **Sixth Gurudharma:** Nuns should not insult, antagonize, or reprimand monks.

* Established by the Buddha to contain women's faults and prevent exceeding bounds.
* Nuns should observe it for life.

## I.3.7.8 Eighth Gurudharma

* Requires a fully ordained nun to salute, praise, stand up, place her palms together, and show respect to a newly ordained monk.
* Established by the Buddha to contain women's faults and prevent exceeding bounds.
* Nuns should observe it for life.

## I.3.8 Mahāprajāpatī'S Acquiescence

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepts the eight gurudharmas with her speech, mind, and even the crown of her head.

* She compares accepting these gurudharmas to a girl accepting a flower garland with both hands, well-pleased and delighted, and placing it on her head.

## I.4 The Buddha'S Consent To Mahāprajāpatī'S Higher Ordination

* Since Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepted the gurudharmas, the Buddha gave her permission to go forth and become a fully ordained bhikṣuṇī.

## Iv.Iii The Eight Gurudharmas To Be Observed For Life


### Iv.Iii.1 Introduction

* The Bhagavān taught eight gurudharmas for bhikṣuṇīs who have gone forth and fully ordained, for containment and to prevent exceeding bounds.
* Women should observe them for life.

### Iv.Iii.2 List Of The Eight Gurudharmas

#### Iv.Iii.2.1 Gurudharma 1

* Understanding that she has attained bhikṣuṇīhood after receiving the going forth and higher ordination from the bhikṣus.

#### Iv.Iii.2.2 Gurudharma 2

* Seeking teacher's instruction from the bhikṣus every half month.

## Iv.Iii.2.3 Gurudharma 3

*  Bhikṣuṇīs should not enter the rainy-season retreat in a residence without bhikṣus.

* This rule was established by the Buddha for containment and to prevent exceeding bounds.
* Women should observe it for life.

# 4 Possibilities Of Reviving The Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣuṇī Lineage1

* A committee was formed to examine the possibility of reviving the Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage in Tibetan Buddhism.
* Two ways to generate a flawless and perfect Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī vow were suggested: 
    * Ordination by bhikṣus alone based on the first *gurudharma*.
    * An "ecumenical" ordination by Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*s and Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇīs.

# Tibetan Text And Relevant Sanskrit Fragments

* Both approaches are based on the first *gurudharma* and the concept of "ordination lineage" in Tibetan Buddhism.
* The *eight gurudharma*s are part of both the *Mahāprajāpatīgautamīvastu* and the *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti*. 
* Both approaches rely on the Tibetan translation of the second part of the Bhikṣu*ṇīkarmavācanā section in the Vinayakṣ*udrakavastu*, as well as Sanskrit fragments.

## 4.1 Mūlasarvāstivāda Nuns' Ordination By Bhikṣus Alone

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda *Bhikṣuṇyupasaṃpadā*jñapti* outlines the stages of a woman's ordination, culminating in full ordination.
* Initial stages are conducted by *bhikṣu*ṇīs, but the final stage requires a saṃgha of ten *bhikṣu*s. 
* Although a female upādhyāyikā is mentioned, she plays no active role after the *bhikṣu* saṃgha joins the *bhikṣu*ṇī saṃgha.

## The Dilemma: The Eight Gurudharmas

* This section focuses on the third type of principle guidelines for a *bhikṣu*ṇī: the eight gurudharmas, which are considered discriminatory by some.
* While historically questionable, the eight *gurudharma*s are canonical and appear in all Vinayas. 
* From a gender perspective, they are seen as subordinating nuns to monks without justification.

* In the Dharmaguptaka tradition, these rules still hold weight.


* The Buddha's refusal to revise the eighth *gurudharma*, which mandates deference to newly ordained *bhikṣu*s even by senior *bhikṣu*ṇīs, highlights the social context of his time.

* Some contemporary Buddhists interpret this rule differently, advocating for mutual respect between genders.


* The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition considers the eight *gurudharma*s essential for reviving the *bhikṣu*ṇī order.
* They are seen as a key to solving the problem of reviving the *bhikṣu*ṇī saṃgha in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition.

* The first *gurudharma*, which allows *bhikṣu*s to perform all stages of women's ordination, is crucial for this revival.

## 4.2 Ecumenical Ordination By Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhikṣus And Dharmaguptaka Bhikṣuṇīs

* Tibetan Buddhists face a situation where there is no existing Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣuṇī saṃgha, but the lineage is not broken.
* The question arises: how can the bhikṣuṇī saṃgha be revived?

##  Ecumenical Ordination

* Historically, different Vinaya schools emerged after the Buddha's death, leading to variations in monastic practices and ordination lineages.
* While canonical texts don't address reviving a bhikṣuṇī saṃgha outside its original tradition, there are examples of monks moving between Vinayas.
* The Dharmaguptaka bhikṣuṇīs have successfully revived the Theravāda bhikṣuṇī saṃgha.

##  Tibetan Context

* Tibetan Buddhism traditionally follows the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, but lacks a bhikṣuṇī lineage.
* Some scholars suggest that Tibetan monks could seek ordination from Dharmaguptaka nuns to revive their own tradition.


## Challenges and Considerations

* The question arises whether newly ordained nuns would belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda or Dharmaguptaka school in such a scenario.
* This issue highlights the need for creative solutions in today's increasingly pluralistic Buddhist world.
* While ancient texts offer no direct guidance, they demonstrate historical flexibility in monastic practices.

# Lineages Serve as Proof of Authenticity

* Lineages in Tibetan Buddhism document key figures to prove a teaching's origin traces back to the Buddha.
* Authenticity signifies genuineness and credibility.
* Tibetans questioned Dharmaguptaka nuns' lineage due to unfamiliarity with their history, especially initially.

# Belonging to a Certain Vinaya School is a Question of Authority

* Each Vinaya school believes only those ordained by its lineage holders are authorized for monastic rites.

# Basic Requirements for Ordination and Officiating Monastic Rites

* Full ordination (Tib. *bsnyen par rdzogs pa*, Skt. upasaṃ*panna*) is required.
* Three virtues: learned in Tripiṭaka, especially Vinaya; free from major offenses (*pārājika*); stable in Vinaya practice after training with a senior monastic for at least ten/twelve years.

# 4.2.1 An Argument For The Validity Of An Ecumenical Bhikṣuṇī Ordination

* A flawless Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣu*ṇī vow can arise from a Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikṣu saṃgha and a Dharmaguptaka bhikṣuṇī saṃgha.
* One vow arises when two saṃghas use the current *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination rite, with the male saṃgha being paramount.
* The perfect vow's generation depends on many conditions, but its substantial cause lies within the ordainer, not transferred from another person.
* School affiliation depends solely on the monastic rite followed during ordination.

* A Mūlasarvāstivāda male saṃgha is necessary and sufficient for legitimate ordination.
* The vow's actual substantial cause resides in the person taking it, not the conferring saṃgha.
* The *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage's cause lies within the ordained person, not the ordainer.

* A male saṃgha of one tradition (e.g., Mūlasarvāstivāda) can ordain with a female saṃgha of another (e.g., Dharmaguptaka).
* *Bhikṣu*ṇīs play a secondary role and are dispensable if unavailable.
* Correct ritual performance leads to women becoming members of the monks' tradition.

* The *bhikṣu*ṇī vow lineage's cause resides in the woman receiving it.
* The Mūlasarvāstivāda ritual used determines Vinaya school affiliation.
* Only the presence of Mūlasarvāstivāda monks as officiants is needed for legitimate ordination.

## The First Premise

* If two saṃghas apply the current *bhikṣuṇī* ordination rite, only one vow arises (that is the *bhikṣuṇī* vow), wherein the male saṃgha is paramount.
* This reasoning assumes that the *bhikṣu* and bhik*ṣuṇī* vow are "of a single nature" or "of a single substance," and there is only one lineage that counts, i.e., the *prātimokṣ*a vow lineage.

## The Second Premise

* Nuns have always been dependent on *bhikṣu*s since the very beginning.
* A *bhikṣuṇī* lineage is not distinct from the *bhikṣu* lineage because bhik*ṣuṇī* ordinations never took place without *bhikṣu*s.

## The Third Premise

* In autumn 2011, field research was conducted in India with Tibetan nun scholars and leading Vinaya scholars of the three main Gelugpa monastic universities to understand the concept of a bhikṣuṇī lineage.
* Discussions focused on whether Mahāprajāpatī had such a lineage, the status of women in India who were fully ordained by a twofold saṃgha, and the status of those first *bhikṣu*ṇīs who were ordained by *bhikṣu*s alone.

## The Fourth Premise

* According to the Vinayottaragrantha ('*Dul ba gzhung dam pa*), if a śikṣamāṇā is ordained through the legal act of a *bhikṣu*, she is deemed to have been fully ordained, even though those who fully ordained her committed a minor infraction.
* Geshe Rinchen Ngödrup stated that whether a person obtains the vow or the vow lineage of a bhikṣu or *bhikṣu*ṇī depends on the gender of the person being ordained, not the ordaining party.

## The Fifth Premise

* Monks have always been ordained by monks. Male ordination lineages do not list every monk ordained.
* By contrast, what might a *bhikṣu*ṇī ordination lineage look like? It could start either with Buddha Śākyamuni or Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī. However, according to the texts that have come down to us, a full-fledged ordination by *bhikṣu*ṇīs alone never existed.

## The Sixth Premise


* An exception is the case of Saṃghamittā, daughter of King Aśoka and founder of an order of *bhikkhunī*s in Sri Lanka around 230 B.C.E. Bhikkhunī Dhammapālā is recorded as her *uppajhāyā* and Ayupalā as her *ācāriyā*.
* Similarly, the Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣu*ṇī lineage is documented in the Pich'*iu-ni chuan-shu*, with the biography of Chu Ching-chien (ca. 292–ca. 361).

## The Seventh Premise

* In early times, the lines between different Vinaya schools were often blurred.
* Practitioners were often glad to get hold of any text at all to be able to continue with their practice and the spread of the *dharma*.





# Number of Nuns Traveling from Sri Lanka to China

* There are differing accounts regarding the number of nuns who traveled from Sri Lanka to China.
* One account mentions Devasarā, along with two other senior nuns, arriving to lead a quorum of eight nuns who had arrived earlier.
* These initial nuns were not yet of the required age and lacked the necessary quorum of ten.

# Double Ordination in East Asia

* Guṇavarman advised the initial nuns to learn Chinese before performing the *bhikṣuṇī* reordination.
* Devasarā and two other nuns arrived and conducted the reordination as planned by Guṇavarman, who passed away before he could do so himself.
* Another account states that eleven more nuns arrived four years later, led by Tessara.

# Tibetan Tradition and Lineage

* There are no detailed records of a Mūlasarvāstivāda śrāmaṇerikā or bhikṣuṇī lineage in the Tibetan tradition.
* Most texts refer to a *mkhan brgyud*, a lineage of male *upādhyāya*s, or a "stream of *prātimokṣ*a vows."

# Prātimokṣa Vows and Gender

* The *bhikṣu*s are considered the authoritative holders of *prātimokṣ*a lineages.
* There is special importance placed on *prātimokṣ*a in Tibetan Buddhism, particularly within the context of the Three Vows-Theories.
* These vows consist of:
    * The *prātimokṣ*a vow (individual liberation vow)
    * The *bodhisattva* vow
    * The mantra vow

# Ordination and Gender Roles

* Tibetan history is unclear on when and by whom the first *śrāmaṇerikā*s became ordained.
* While monks are traditionally considered superior, some high-ranking Tibetan teachers who are not monks confer all three vows.
* This raises questions about whether anyone who has taken at least one of the seven types of individual liberation vows is considered a holder of a *prātimokṣ*a vow and authorized to confer them.

# The Case of Sex Change

* The Abhidharmakośabhāṣya explains that the vow of a *bhikṣuṇī* does not differ from that of a *bhikṣu*.
* The Vinayottaragrantha addresses the case of a man who changes sex after full ordination, stating that they are still considered ordained and should be transferred to the community of *bhikṣuṇīs*.

# Superiority of Male Saṃgha

* Tibetan tradition offers two explanations for the perceived superiority of the male saṃgha:
    * The male body is superior.
    * The male saṃgha was founded first.

* However, Buddhist women during the Buddha's time questioned this hierarchy, advocating for mutual respect between monks and nuns regardless of gender.

## The Second Premise

* A prātimokṣa vow arises from its substantial cause within the continuum of the ordainee, not from outside.
* Tsongkhapa states that a prātimokṣa vow is either a kind of form or the continued intention to abandon non-virtue.
* Form cannot be substantially caused by mind; renunciation can only be the substantial cause when accepted as the continued intention to abandon non-virtue.
* Three causal motivations are needed: the wish to take it, understanding that one has attained it, and a stable intention to transcend suffering.

## The Third Premise

* School affiliation depends on the monastic rite followed during ordination.
* What makes one specifically a Mūlasarvāstivāda nun is being ordained according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda monastic rite.
* There are seven differences between the *bhikṣu* and *bhikṣuṇī* ordination ritual.
* The question arises whether visiting monks from different Vinaya schools can assist in ordination if resident monastics are insufficient.

## Tibetan:

*  The text discusses the behavior of resident monks towards visiting monks skilled in Sūtra, Vinaya, and Mātṛkā according to the *Poṣadhavastu*.
* The Buddha instructs resident monks to go out a distance of up to two and a half *yojanas* to receive visiting scholars with umbrellas, victory banners, and flags. 




## Tibetan:

* **Possible interpretations:** This section could be interpreted as advice to practice hospitality and respect visiting monks. It discusses the possibility of Dharmaguptaka nuns assisting in Mūlasarvāstivāda ordinations. 
* **Vinaya Similarities:**  This section argues that despite minor differences, the nature of vows across Vinaya traditions is comparable. The author uses gender reassignment as an example to illustrate this point.
* **School Affiliation and Concord:** This section explains that school affiliation depends on factors like location, time, language, and teachers. While different schools may have distinct characteristics, they can still be in concord, which is essential for valid monastic acts.
* **Ecumenical Ordination as a Possibility:** This section explores the possibility of ecumenical ordination, where monks from different Vinaya traditions cooperate to ordain nuns. The author argues that this could be admissible and even a duty under exceptional circumstances.

## 4.2.2 Recapitulating The Second Approach (Ecumenical Ordination)

* **Justification for Ecumenical Ordination:** This section outlines three reasons why ecumenical ordination can generate a flawless Mūlasarvāstivāda *bhikṣuṇī* vow:
    1.  The importance of the *bhikṣu saṃgha* and the gender neutrality of the vow's generation.
    2. The candidate's attitude being crucial for vow attainment.
    3. Meeting the specific requirements of the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination rite.

* **Shared Lineage and Pluralistic View:** This section emphasizes that all Vinaya traditions share a common origin and calls for a pluralistic approach where each tradition is treated equally. It suggests that intensive dialogues are necessary to address concerns and ensure a clear understanding before proceeding with an ecumenical ordination.


## 4.2.3 Further Rules And Regulations To Be Considered

* Participants in a *saṃghakarman* must comply with several rules and regulations for it to be valid.
* The act must be complete, flawless, and without disorder in terms of actions, words, and sequence.
* A key condition is that the *saṃgha* be in concord or agreement, fulfilling three principles: a quorum with necessary virtues, freedom from discord (not attending or leaving without permission), and staying within the same monastic boundary (*sīmā*).

## Can Visiting Monks Or Nuns Participate In Saṃgha Acts Of Different Vinaya Schools?

* The question arises whether visiting monks from different Vinaya schools can participate in *saṃgha* acts like the bimonthly confession ceremony.
* This is particularly relevant for monks studying at Tibetan Buddhist institutions but belonging to traditions like Vietnamese, Korean, or Taiwanese *Dharmaguptakavinaya*.
* The author observed Tibetan monks from different lineages performing the *poṣ*adha* ceremony together during large events.
* A Gelongma committee of Vinaya experts confirmed that monks holding different Mūlasarvāstivāda*vinaya* lineages can perform a joint *poṣ*adha* ceremony.
* According to the MSV, even if views differ, the act is valid as long as no member objects and the boundary has been properly established. 




## Can Dharmaguptaka Nuns Practicing Tibetan Buddhism Convert To The Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya School?

* This section discusses whether Tibetan Buddhist nuns ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition can convert to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school.
* It refers to the concept of *samānasaṃvāsaka* and *nānāsaṃvāsika*, which denote monks belonging to the same or different congregations, respectively.

##  Samānasaṃvāsaka And Nānāsaṃvāsika

* The terms *samānasaṃvāsaka* and *nānāsaṃvāsika* are not absolute but depend on perspective.
* Monks consider their own congregation as *samānasaṃvāsaka* and those with whom they don't perform common rituals as *nānāsaṃvāsika*.

## Re-ordination Of Nuns In The Mūlasarvāstivāda Tradition

* The question of re-ordination for nuns ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition but practicing Tibetan Buddhism is controversial.
* One impediment to women's ordination is having been previously ordained, while men can be re-ordained up to three times.
* A Theravāda monk suggests that these nuns could declare their intention to follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya and belong to that school.

## Nānāsaṃvāsika Status

* *Nānasaṃvāsa* status arises from disagreement about Vinaya rules and can be resolved by settling the dispute.
* Once agreement is reached, those who were *nānasaṃvāsa* become *samānasaṃvāsa* again.


## Regaining Samānasaṃvāsaka Status

* The Tibetan translation of the Poṣ*adhavastu* explains two ways to regain *samānasaṃvāsaka* status:
    * Declaring oneself to be of the same community.
    * Being reinstated by the community after suspension for not seeing an offense. 


## Tibetan:

* The text discusses whether Dharmaguptaka nuns can be considered part of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya school in Tibet.
* It explores three options: re-ordination, "making strong" through a ceremony, and recognizing existing Dharmaguptaka nuns as fully ordained.
* The Dalai Lama has already recognized Dharmaguptaka nuns as fully ordained but they still follow a different Vinaya than Tibetan monks.

## 4.3 Historic Decision Taken by the "12th Religious Conference of the Four Major Schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon Tradition"

* After 30 years of research, the conference decided that Tibetan nuns can be ordained in the Dharmaguptaka tradition.
* This decision acknowledges the validity of the East Asian Dharmaguptaka *bhikṣuṇī* ordination lineage.
* The conference also decided to translate Dharmaguptaka Vinaya texts into Tibetan and make them part of the Tibetan canon.

## 4.3.1 Implications Of The Decision Taken At The Conference

* This decision is a major step towards recognizing other Buddhist traditions on an equal footing.
* It acknowledges the Dharmaguptaka lineage as reliable and opens the door for further integration of Dharmaguptaka practices in Tibetan Buddhism.
* The decision aligns with the Dalai Lama's vision to include texts from various Asian canons into the Tibetan canon.

## 4.3.2 Shortcomings Of The Decision

* Despite decades of research and the Dalai Lama's encouragement, no clear decision has been made on restoring the Mūlasarvāstivāda nuns' ordination lineage.
* The "12th Religious Conference" concluded that it is "difficult" to reach a decision, implying impossibility.
* This leaves novice nuns uncertain about their future ordination and reliant on potentially unfamiliar traditions.

## Why is this important?

* Novice nuns desire ordination from their own teachers within their cultural context.
* The lack of a clear path forward creates uncertainty for nuns seeking full ordination.
* It remains unclear how Tibetan Dharmaguptaka nuns will interact with Mūlasarvāstivāda monks in daily practices requiring cooperation.


## The decision taken in June 2015

* The "12th Religious Conference" decided that Tibetan Buddhist novice nuns can choose to receive Dharmaguptaka ordination.
* This introduces the Dharmaguptaka lineage into Tibetan Buddhism, signifying a pluralistic approach towards other traditions.
* Despite its shortcomings, this decision represents a significant step forward in recognizing diverse Buddhist practices. 


## 4.4 Prospects

* The Karmapa announced his intention to restore nuns' vows in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, opting for an ecumenical approach involving Dharmaguptaka nuns.
* This decision has sparked debate as some Tibetan Vinaya scholars question the validity of ordination by monks alone.
* The Karmapa proposes a two-stage process: first conferring novice vows with the help of Dharmaguptaka nuns, and later full ordination through a joint assembly of Mūlasarvāstivāda monks and Dharmaguptaka nuns.

* This approach aims to address inconsistencies in Tibetan Buddhist practice where female lay and novice precepts have been given by monks despite canonical evidence suggesting nuns should confer these vows.
* The Karmapa emphasizes the importance of having fully ordained nuns for the proper functioning of the monastic tradition.

* In March 2017, nineteen women from various Karma Kagyü nunneries received *śrāmaṇerikā* precepts from Dharmaguptaka nuns in Bodhgayā.
* This event marked a significant step towards restoring full ordination for Tibetan Buddhist nuns.

* The involvement of Dharmaguptaka nuns brings valuable experience and knowledge to the process, though it may take longer for nuns outside the Karma Kagyü tradition to access this opportunity.
* For Western women practicing in the Tibetan tradition, clarity on which ordination lineage to pursue is crucial for their Vinaya practice.

* The acceptance of Dharmaguptaka nuns within Tibetan Buddhism is growing, facilitated by dialogue and access to relevant texts in Tibetan.
* Dialogue on Vinaya is expanding beyond nuns to include monks, fostering trust and understanding between traditions.


*  The Bon tradition, prevalent in Amdo and Kham, also has a system of ordination for women, with Bonpo monks conferring all stages of vows.

# Appendix 1

* Table 1 presents a list of Tibetan Canon editions considered for the collation, categorized by tradition: Thems spangs ma (Western group) and *Tshal pa* (Eastern group).
* Editions 1-7 belong to the Thems spangs ma tradition, while editions 9-13 belong to the *Tshal pa* tradition.

* The Derge edition is based on the 'Jang sa tham block print from the *Tshal pa* tradition but incorporates emendations from the Thems spangs ma tradition.
* The Phu brag edition could not be definitively assigned to either tradition.
