# Early Buddhist **Meditation**

* This paper presents a method for understanding early Buddhist meditation based on textual analysis.
* The author argues that some views and practices in the early Buddhist canon are borrowed from other religious movements of the time, such as Jainism.
* These borrowings can be identified by their inconsistent presence in the canon and their similarity to practices found in other traditions.

# The Historical Buddha

* The author emphasizes the importance of considering the teachings of the historical Buddha rather than simply "early Buddhism."
* He argues that the Buddhist tradition itself recognizes the Buddha's unique message, suggesting that novel ideas and practices found in the earliest texts should be attributed to him.

# Examples of Borrowed Practices

* Three examples are provided: 
    * The ability to remain unaffected by external stimuli, which was claimed by non-Buddhists.
    * The practice of suppressing thoughts through coercion, similar to Jaina practices.
    * The practice of "annihilation of former actions" and "non-performing of new actions," also attributed to Jainas.

# Authentic Buddhist Meditation

* After deducting borrowed practices, the author proposes that the Four Dhyānas and the practice of mindfulness remain as authentically Buddhist.
* These practices are frequently mentioned in the canon, appear in older layers of the tradition, and are not criticized or contradicted by other Buddhist teachings.

## Contradictions in the Buddhist Canon

* Professor Richard Gombrich presented contradictions in the Buddhist canon.
* The author engaged with Gombrich's views and decided not to abandon their own positions.

## A Stereotyped Description of the Path of Liberation

* This description is repeated numerous times in canonical Sūtras.
* It resists tests of authenticity proposed by the author.
* The passage describes meditation practices aimed at purifying the mind from hindrances like longing, ill will, dullness, restlessness, and doubt.
* It outlines stages of meditation with specific characteristics.

## Implications for Understanding Buddhist Meditation

* The author proposes that the historical Buddha claimed to have found a method to end suffering through meditation.
* Two scenarios are presented: either the Buddha's claim was mistaken, or he actually achieved what he described.
* Accepting the second scenario requires rethinking how humans function and the role of meditation.


## Textual Scholarship and Scientific Study

* Buddhist meditation attracts scientific interest, but textual scholars are often excluded from this research.
* The author argues that textual scholarship can contribute to the debate by providing essential information about the historical context and goals of Buddhist meditation.
* Early Buddhist texts present a method for ending suffering, with meditational practices as a means to achieve this goal.

## Meditation as a Means to an End

* Meditational states are not the aim in themselves but a path to lasting psychological transformation free from suffering.
* The author compares meditational states to the Alps on a journey: they must be traversed to reach the destination, which is freedom from suffering.
* The central claim of early Buddhist texts is that complete and lasting psychological transformation is possible and was achieved by the historical Buddha.

# A Lasting Psychological Transformation

* A lasting psychological transformation must have a neurological counterpart, likely in the form of changes in the brain.
* Early Buddhist tradition suggests this transformation can happen quickly (in one night), implying relatively minor neurological changes.
* We need a scientific psychological theory to understand these processes, not just information about the brain.

# The Need for a Psychological Theory

* Understanding brain processes alone is insufficient to understand complex psychological transformations like those described in early Buddhist texts.
* Without a solid psychological theory, we risk relying on intuition and experience, leading to pop-psychology rather than scientific understanding.

# Pleasure and Absorption

* Early Buddhist texts suggest bliss experienced in meditation arises from absorption (effortless attention or concentration).
* This observation is more amenable to empirical verification than claims that bliss is part of the natural state of consciousness.
* Drawing on this, we can hypothesize that pleasure results from absorption, with the degree of pleasure corresponding to the degree of absorption.

# Absorption as a Motivating Force

* Pleasure, arising from absorption, acts as a motivating force in human behavior.
* We seek to re-create situations associated with past pleasure, driven by memory traces.
* This theory suggests that true freedom lies in recognizing absorption as the real source of pleasure and deflating the influence of past experiences.

# Freedom from Suffering

* The early Buddhist claim of a state free from suffering aligns with this theory.
* Freedom comes from understanding the true source of pleasure (absorption) and detaching from mistaken associations with past experiences.

# Taking Buddhist Texts Seriously

* Scholars should approach Buddhist texts without preconceived notions, allowing them to challenge existing beliefs.
* The possibility of a transition to a state free from suffering, frequently mentioned in these texts, deserves serious consideration.

# scholars, including probably most Western scholars, do indeed not believe this claim.

* Some scholars reject a specific early Buddhist claim without further explanation.
* The author finds this approach patronizing and believes it allows for cultural prejudices to influence scholarship.
