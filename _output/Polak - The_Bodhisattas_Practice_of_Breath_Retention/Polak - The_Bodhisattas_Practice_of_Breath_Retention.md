## The Bodhisatta's Practice of Breath Retention: Self-Mortification or an Advanced Meditative Technique?

* This paper focuses on the description of breath retention practice and its side effects found in three suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya.
* Johannes Bronkhorst argues that this account doesn't belong to the earliest stratum of Buddhist literature and the descriptions of side effects are unauthentic. 
* The author disagrees with Bronkhorst, arguing that the Buddhist account is genuine and relatively early based on comparisons with modern accounts of *prāṇāyāma* techniques.

## Popular Image vs. Actual Practices

* The popular narrative emphasizes the bodhisatta's ascetic practices as extreme self-mortification.
* This image overshadows other important episodes, such as his training with meditative teachers Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta.
* The episode of ascetic practices is depicted in the *Buddhacarita*, but the training with Āḷāra and Uddaka is less known.

## Description of Ascetic Practices

* The Mahāsaccaka Sutta, Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, and Saṅgārava Sutta describe the bodhisatta's ascetic practices in detail.
* These practices are labeled as 'striving'/'exertion' (padhāna), not *tapas*, which is a more straightforward label for asceticism.

## Analysis of Practices

* The first two practices involve restraining, crushing/squeezing, and scorching the mind by clenching teeth and pressing the tongue against the palate.
* The second stage involves stopping in-breaths and out-breaths through nose, mouth, and ears, aiming for 'breathless meditation'.
* The last practice is a fast with limited soup made from beans and vetch.

## Connection to Jain and Hindu Practices

* Johannes Bronkhorst suggests that the bodhisatta's practices may be connected to Jain and early Hindu traditions.
* He argues that these practices aim at non-activity of the body and mind, which was a goal shared by many religious movements at the time.
* The Maitrī Upaniṣad describes a similar practice involving pressing the tongue against the palate and suppressing breath and mind.

## Conclusion

* The bodhisatta's practices were not simply self-torment but meditative methods known to non-Buddhists.
* These practices, including breath retention, are described in Hindu scriptures as part of *prāṇāyāma* techniques.

# The Buddhist Account of Bodhisatta's Strivings

* This account includes descriptions of side effects resulting from practices described in the passage, such as intense sweating, internal noises, headaches, stomach pain, and a feeling of burning.
* These side effects are similar to those described in suttas about terminally ill people, suggesting they might not belong to the earliest stratum of Buddhist literature.

# Comparison with Hindu Yogic Practices

* Swami Rama's book *Path of Fire and Light* provides firsthand information about advanced *prāṇāyāma* techniques, shedding light on the Buddhist account.
* Sweating is a common side effect during initial stages of *prāṇāyāma*, confirming the description in the Buddhist text.

# Internal Sounds and Head Pains

* The sound of winds rushing through arteries and veins can cause internal sounds heard during breath restraint, as explained by Swami Rama.
* This phenomenon is also mentioned in the Maitrī Upaniṣad, indicating its presence in ancient Brahminic literature.
* Congestion of head arteries and veins due to increased blood pressure from breath restraint could explain headaches described in the Buddhist account.

# Pain in the Alimentary Tract

* Breath restraint can cause air to enter the esophagus, stomach, and bowels, leading to pain that subsides with practice.
* Swami Rama confirms this side effect, making the passage in the Buddhist sutta appear more genuine.

# Extreme Heat

* Kumbhaka (breath retention) increases heat in the body, causing tingling and stinging sensations.
* This aligns with the description of extreme heat experienced by the bodhisatta during breath restraint.

# Fasting

* The bodhisatta's fast, while labeled as 'asceticism,' differs from the yogic practices described by Swami Rama.
* Johannes Bronkhorst suggests it corresponds to Jain practices of voluntary fasting to death.




## The Account of Strivings and its Significance

* Swami Rama suggests a connection between diet and *prāṇāyāma*, implying the bodhisatta's fasting might have aimed at purifying his body for knowledge and vision.
* The similarities between Buddhist passages and Swami Rama's descriptions of *prāṇāyāma* are too strong to be coincidental, suggesting the 'account of striving' accurately depicts side effects of advanced *prāṇāyāma* techniques.

## Origin and Purpose of the Account

* The description of side-effects in the 'account of strivings' likely predates its use in Buddhist suttas like Channovāda Sutta, Channa Sutta, and Phagguṇa Sutta.
* While the account could be authentically Buddhist, describing practices performed by the Buddha himself or a convert, it might also originate from non-Buddhist sources.

## Polemic vs. Historical Account

* If polemical, the account criticizes quasi-*prāṇāyāma* techniques as inefficient and indirectly critiques non-Buddhists practicing them.
* It praises Buddhist jhāna as efficient and spontaneous in contrast to forced methods.
* However, later Buddhists failed to recognize the 'strivings' as *prāṇāyāma*, seeing them merely as asceticism.

## Bodhisatta's Goal and Non-Buddhist Meditation

* The bodhisatta likely sought liberating knowledge through his practices, not simply cessation of activity.
* This aligns with a non-Buddhist meditation current where liberating knowledge was the ultimate goal.
* This suggests this current may be older than previously thought, predating Bronkhorst's proposed evolution from the 'main stream'.

## Critique of Bronkhorst's Views

* Alexander Wynne criticizes Bronkhorst for conflating evidence from different texts regarding the origin of Buddhist meditation.

# The Misunderstanding of Early Brahmic Meditation

*  The author criticizes Johannes Bronkhorst's view that early Brahminic meditation involved severe asceticism.
* Alexander Wynne argues that the realization of *ātman* was the primary goal of early Brahminic schools, not bodily renunciation.
* The author suggests that the history of non-Buddhist meditative practices may be more complex than Bronkhorst presents.

# The Role of Samaṇa Movement

* The author proposes that the *samaṇa* movement played a crucial role in developing Indian meditative and philosophical thought.
*  *Samaṇa*-s introduced new ideas boldly and challenged prevailing worldviews, unlike later thinkers who often presented themselves as commentators on tradition.
* The author believes that the *samaṇa* movement was a "golden age" of Indian thought and that Buddhism likely emerged from this context.

# Authenticity of Bodhisatta's Strivings

* The author questions the authenticity of the account of the bodhisatta's strivings, which appears in three suttas (Mahāsaccaka Sutta, Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, and Saṅgārava Sutta).
*  Bronkhorst argues that only the Mahāsaccaka Sutta provides a coherent narrative context for these strivings, suggesting they were intended as a critique of Jain practices.
* The author challenges Bronkhorst's interpretation, pointing out inconsistencies in the narrative context and suggesting alternative explanations for the bodhisatta's motivations.

# Rethinking "Asceticism"

* The author argues that the term "asceticism" may not accurately describe the bodhisatta's practices.
*  The bodhisatta's strivings involved sophisticated techniques, and unpleasant feelings were side effects rather than goals.
* The author suggests alternative terms like *iriyā* (posture/movement) or *paṭipadā* (path/method) to better capture the nature of these practices.



# The Meaning of Padhāna

*  In Indian traditions associated with asceticism and self-denial, the term *padhāna* does not necessarily carry those meanings.
* Examples include phrases like 'applies (lit. stretches forth) the mind and strives,' indicating effort rather than strict austerity.
* The concept of *sammappadhānā* (right strivings) aligns with *sammā* vāyāma (right effort), a component of the Noble Eightfold Path, further suggesting a broader meaning beyond asceticism.

# The Significance of the Account of Strivings

* Practices described in the account of strivings differ from typical ascetic practices.
* Contemporary practitioners are often labeled as 'yogins,' 'adepts of *prāṇāyāma***', or 'meditative masters' rather than 'ascetics.'
* The authenticity of this account has implications for understanding early Buddhist meditation, particularly jhāna.

# Jhāna Meditation and the Account of Strivings

* The bodhisatta's path to awakening in the Suttapiṭaka is crucial for understanding early Buddhist jhāna.
* The account of strivings is linked to the bodhisatta's recollection of his first jhāna experience.
* By juxtaposing inefficient meditation methods with jhāna, insights into its nature can be gleaned.
