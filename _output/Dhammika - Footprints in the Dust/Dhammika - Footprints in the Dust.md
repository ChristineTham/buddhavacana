## Ix

* Buddhism teaches rebirth (saṃsāra) and awakening (*bodhi*, Nirvana).
* The Buddha had many past lives, recounted in the Jātaka.
* After his death, devotees created new 'lives' for him, some more incredible than those in the Jātaka.

##  The Buddha: Myth and Reality

* Some claimed the Buddha's faeces smelled fragrant due to his purity. Others refuted this claim as illogical.
* The *Lalitavistara* depicted the Buddha surrounded by marvels and wonders.
* The *Saddharmapuṇdarīka Sūtra* presented the Buddha as an eternal cosmic being who used a human form to teach.

##  More Grounded Accounts

* Aśvaghoṣa's *Buddhacarita* portrayed the Buddha as exceptional but human.
* The Hindu *Matsya Purāṇa* claimed the Buddha was an incarnation of Visṇu, a claim not taken seriously by Hindus or Buddhists.

## European Interpretations

* By the 10th century, a confused account of the Buddha's life reached Europe and he was inducted into the Catholic Church as St. Josaphat.
* With European colonialism, the Buddha was seen as historically real but his divinity was debated.
* Some viewed him as a reformer of Hinduism, a rationalist, or a great moral teacher.

##  Scholarly Interpretations

* Hendrik Kern claimed Buddhism originated from sun worship.
* Ananda Coomaraswamy argued the Buddha taught Vedānta concepts.
* Karl Rahner called Buddhists "anonymous Christians."
* The counter-culture movement portrayed the Buddha as a vegetarian and spiritual guide.

## A Recent Revelation

* A recent publication claims the Buddha was a skilled military general who suffered psychological trauma from war and may have been murdered.


##  The Search for the Historical Buddha

* Examining early records is crucial to understanding the Buddha, but dating ancient Indian literature is challenging.
* The Pali Tipitaka is considered the earliest source of information about the Buddha.

## The Pali Tipitaka

* It consists of three divisions: Sutta Piṭaka (sermons and dialogues), Vinaya Piṭaka (monastic rules), and Abhidhamma Piṭaka (philosophical analysis).
* The Sutta Piṭaka contains the core teachings, with some later additions.
* The Vinaya Piṭaka includes monastic rules and early history of the order.

##  The Language of the Buddha

* The Tipitaka is written in Pali, a language closely related to what the Buddha likely spoke.

# The Authenticity of the Tipitaka

* The Tipitaka was assembled over centuries and is a mix of early material with later additions.
* Careful examination reveals that core material in the Sutta Piṭaka and parts of the Vinaya Piṭaka date back to the Buddha's time or shortly after.
* While some claim the Buddha's words were written down soon after his death, it is likely that monastic communities relied on oral transmission for generations.

# The Advantages of Oral Transmission

* Before printing, handwritten copies were prone to errors and alterations.
* Human memory, particularly when trained from childhood, can be highly accurate.
* Brahmins, who formed a significant part of the Buddha's disciples, possessed exceptional memorization skills.

 # Preservation Techniques in the Tipitaka

* Monks learned discourses by heart through repetition and chanting.
* Monastic congregations specialized in different parts of the Tipitaka.
* Sermons were edited to enhance memorability using mnemonic devices like lists, rhyming verses, and repetitions.

# Evidence for the Buddha's Existence Outside the Tipitaka

* Asoka's inscription at Lumbini mentions the Buddha's birthplace.
* An inscribed relic casket from Piprahwa (Kapilavatthu) refers to the Buddha's relics.
* The Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad criticizes "tawny robed ones" who teach a doctrine denying the soul, likely referring to Buddhists.

# Historical Accounts of the Buddha in the Tipitaka

* While not a chronologically arranged biography, the Vinaya includes an account of the Buddha's early career.
* The longest discourse in the Sutta Piṭaka records events from his later years.
* These narratives indicate that ancient Buddhists had a sense of history and aimed to portray the Buddha within it.

# Character and Personality of the Buddha

* While a complete biography is impossible, the Tipitaka offers insights into the Buddha's character, habits, relationships, and teachings.
* Vignettes and asides provide glimpses into his personality, likely reflecting genuine memories.

# Supernormal Abilities Attributed to the Buddha

* Some passages ascribe supernormal abilities to the Buddha, which may be later embellishments or reflect beliefs of those who witnessed him.
* Charismatic individuals are often credited with such powers, and these accounts could also express a worldview where supernormal phenomena were accepted.


# The Middle Land and the Impact of Iron

* The Buddha lived in the Middle Land (majjhima desa), roughly equivalent to modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
* The discovery of high-quality iron around the 7th century BCE transformed agriculture and settlement patterns.
* Iron tools made farming more efficient, leading to larger settlements and population growth.

## The Ideal City

* The Buddha described Kusavatī as a prosperous and crowded city, rich in resources and full of life.
* It was characterized by bustling activity, sounds of commerce and celebration, and abundant food.

## City Defenses and Infrastructure

* Cities were fortified with walls, towers, gates, and sometimes moats for protection.
* Gatekeepers ensured security, and the east gate was considered auspicious while the south gate was inauspicious.
* Notable buildings included the king's palace, court, treasury, tax office, market, and municipal halls.

## Public Buildings and Amenities

* Municipal halls were open-pillared structures used for public gatherings and administration.
* Alms halls provided food and shelter to the poor, travelers, and ascetics.
* Entertainment halls hosted religious debates and other events.

## Housing

* Most houses were made of wood, wattle and daub, or unfired brick with thatched roofs.
* Wealthier citizens had tile roofs and more elaborate residences.
* Houses typically had two floors and gaps between them to prevent fire spread.

## City Hazards

* Fire was a constant threat due to wooden construction and open fires.
* Flooding was another danger, as cities were located near rivers.
* Disease outbreaks could occur due to poor sanitation.

## Parks and Gardens

* Cities featured both private and public parks and gardens.
* Some included ornamental plants, ponds, and benches.
* They served as places for relaxation, spiritual practice, and gatherings of ascetics.

## Religious Shrines

* Cetiyas were trees or rock formations believed to house gods or spirits.
* Thūpas (stūpas) were earthen mounds containing the ashes of revered individuals.

## Civic Life and Culture

* Philanthropic individuals funded public reservoirs for bathing, washing, and drinking water.
* Some wealthy citizens established civic centers with accommodation, sports venues, and religious spaces.
* Poetry was a popular art form, and recitals took place in various settings.

## Entertainment

* Itinerant entertainers like acrobats, snake charmers, magicians, and minstrels were common.
* Theatrical performances, festivals, and even beauty pageants provided entertainment.

## City Challenges

* Stray cattle posed a risk of injury.
* Streets were often dirty and smelly due to waste disposal practices.
* Lack of street lighting made nighttime navigation hazardous.
* Occasional civil disturbances and crime occurred.

# Village Life

* Most people lived in villages and were farmers, although other occupations existed.
* Villages were typically surrounded by fences for protection and had clearly defined boundaries.
* Farming life was repetitive and hard, with burdensome taxation and the threat of natural disasters like droughts and floods.
* The Buddha observed that rural life was precarious, with constant fear of famine, disease, and banditry.

# Trade and Commerce

* Increasing food surplus and population growth led to the expansion of commerce and long-distance trade.
* Caravans transported goods between cities and regions, sometimes traveling for months.
* Merchants formed guilds to protect their interests and had access to rulers.
* The first currency in India appeared around 600 BCE, facilitating trade and creating new professions.
* Luxurious goods were imported from distant lands, indicating disposable income and demand for non-essentials.

# Political Changes

* The old republics or chiefdoms were gradually giving way to monarchies.
* Kingdoms like Magadha, Kosala, Vaṃsā, and Pañcāla emerged.
* Chiefdoms had participatory governments with councils of high-status men.
* Cities, towns, and villages had council halls for conducting community business. 




# Gods, Brahmins And Ascetics

* The majority of people in the Middle Land during the Buddha's time were animists, not Hindus.
* Animism was an informal religion with few traces left behind, but some information can be gleaned from Brahminical, Jain and Buddhist sources.
* Shrines to various gods and spirits, revered kings, heroes or saintly people existed, but there were no temples.

* People believed that the spirits inhabiting these places had protective power and would respond to prayers and offerings.
* Offerings included milk, water, garlands, scented oil lamps, cloth tied around tree trunks, a red or ochre-coloured paste (*vaṇṇaka*), and flowers.
* Animal and occasionally human sacrifices were made to sacred trees.

* Belief in various spirits like *yakkha*s, bhūtas, nāgas, *rakkhasa*s, kumbhaṇḍas, *pisāca*s and *picācillikā*s was common.
* Some spirits were benevolent, while others were menacing and required propitiation with offerings.

* Gods (*deva*s) were seen as separate from and higher than the various spirits.
* Brahminism gradually assimilated many local deities into its pantheon by claiming they were aspects of Vedic gods or simply alternative names.

* Many local gods and goddesses were associated with fertility, rain and crop protection.

# Formal Religion: Brahminism

* Brahminism was the formal religion during the Buddha's time and later evolved into Hinduism.
* It had a priesthood, scriptures (the three Vedas), a liturgical language, and defined doctrines and rituals.
* The Vedas consist of hymns addressed to various gods, praising them and calling upon them for help.
* Sacrifices (*yāga*) were central to Brahminism, involving elaborate rituals conducted by brahmin priests.

* Offerings were thrown into sacred fires to reach the gods.
* Sacrifices marked seasons, consecrated rulers, warded off calamity, brought rain, guaranteed victory in war, and more.
* In some sacrifices, animals were slaughtered and offered to the fire.
* A hallucinogenic drink called soma was consumed by brahmins and shared with the gods.

* Vedic Brahminism originated a thousand years before the Buddha in Āryāvarta (northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan).
* Aryans believed in four castes: brahmins, warriors (*khattiya*), traders/farmers (*vessa*), and menials (*sudda*).
* The first three castes were considered "twice-born" and underwent initiation rites.

* Menials could not participate in Vedic rituals, and untouchables and foreigners had no place in Brahminical religion.
* Aryans viewed the people of the Middle Land as demonic because they did not follow Aryan customs or worship Vedic gods.
* Brahmins gained legitimacy by advising kings and performing rituals for them.

* They were granted estates and privileges, and their social theories, particularly the fourfold division of society, became accepted norms.

## Over the centuries, and certainly by the Buddha's time, the meaning of the Vedic sacrifice had changed

* The hymns came to be seen more as magical spells.
* Rituals became increasingly complex and expensive.
* Brahmin fees for performing rituals became exorbitant.
* Dissatisfaction with these changes resulted in some people reinterpreting Brahminical doctrines.

## Brahminism was very much a community-centred, family-orientated religion

* The ideal setting for the twice-born's life was living amongst his kin in a village.
* His goal was to have a faithful wife who could give him sons and to be rich in land and cattle.
* New cities were repugnant to brahmins.

## Not a religion as such, but a religious movement which had a presence throughout the Middle Land, probably for centuries already before the Buddha's time, was that of a class of ascetics most commonly called *samaṇas*.

* These ascetics were also known variously as wanderers (*paribbājaka*), ford-makers (*titthakara*), mendicants (*bhikkhu* or *piṇḍola*), or silent ones (*muni*).
* Most *samaṇa*s were also celibate.
* Some women chose the life of renunciation.

## A samaṇa who believed he had attained some kind of spiritual realization might attract disciples, and thus a sect or school would come into being

* Others lived in small, informal bands, and a few lived alone in forests.
* *Samaṇa*s generally rejected the Vedas and most Brahminical beliefs and practices.
* They gave precedence to personal experience over dogma and scriptural authority.
* They experimented with meditation, self-mortification, yogic breathing, fasting and extended periods of isolation.

## By the fifth century BCE, there were at least a dozen major samaṇa fraternities or sects in the Middle Land

* Most of these sects, their founders and the doctrines they espoused soon faded into obscurity.
* Other than the Buddhists, the only ones to last more than a few centuries were the Ājīvakas and the Jains.

## Jainism had been founded by the sage Pārśva in about the seventh century BCE, and was then reformed, reformulated and revitalized by Mahāvīra

* Those who adhered to Pārśva's original doctrine and discipline still existed during the Buddha's time.
* They differed from Mahāvīra's disciples, who went naked, by wearing a small cloth over their genitals - hence their name, 'They of the One Cloth' (*ekasātaka*).

## In many respects Jainism was similar to Buddhism, but a major difference, and one from which several other differences arise, was the idea in Jainism that every act, intentional or not, created kamma.

* It also accepted the reality of a soul, something which Buddhism rejected.
* Jainism has survived in India until today.


## By the Buddha's time a small but significant number of brahmins had adopted some samaṇa practices

* Known as vānaprastha or *vaikhānasa*, they were usually identified by their matted hair (*jaṭila*) and the deer skins (*ajina*) they wore.
* Some spent the day at the edge of their village or in the nearby forest tending the sacred fire and returned to their homes in the evening.

## Most samaṇa fraternities or sects looked back to founders who they believed had lived in the distant past, some of whom were mythical and others possibly real

* The Jains looked back to Pārśva.
* The Buddha once mentioned six "ford makers" from the past whose names were still recalled with reverence.

# The Buddha's Path

* The Buddha compared his teachings to an ancient road or path followed by fully awakened Buddhas in the past.
* This path is called the Noble Eightfold Path.

# The Status of Samaṇas

*  Samaṇas were wandering ascetics who rejected Vedic authority and sought enlightenment through their own practices.
* They were generally respected, but some people viewed them with suspicion or disdain.
* Some samaṇas engaged in questionable practices, exploiting people's faith for personal gain.

# Tension Between Samaṇas and Brahmins

*  Brahmins, the priestly class who upheld Vedic tradition, saw samaṇas as rivals and heretics.
* This tension is reflected in literary sources, including the Tipitaka, which records numerous instances of brahmin hostility towards samaṇas and the Buddha.

# The Buddha's Identity

* The Buddha firmly identified himself within the samaṇa tradition, seeing his Dhamma as an alternative to Brahmanism rather than a reform of it.
* He rejected or reinterpreted most Brahmanical doctrines and practices.

# The Sakyans

* The Sakyans were a small and relatively unimportant chiefdom in the Terai region of northern India.
* They claimed descent from King Okkāka and named their principal town Kapilavatthu after the sage Kapila.
* The Sakyans were vassals of the kingdom of Kosala and considered rustics by their neighbors.

# Kapilavatthu

* Kapilavatthu was the main Sakyan town and likely a small but prosperous place.
* It had a council hall, a school, and was surrounded by forests.
* The Buddha occasionally visited Kapilavatthu and stayed in nearby parks and orchards.

# Population and Settlements

* Archaeologists found eighty-one small settlements (less than two hectares) dating from the seventh to third century BCE in the Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. These could have housed up to 500 people each.
* Fourteen settlements covered an area of two to four hectares, potentially accommodating between 500 and 1000 inhabitants.
* Four larger settlements (over four hectares) could have held 1200-1300 people.

* All these settlements were smaller than major cities of the time and would be considered villages today.

# Kapilavatthu

* Excavations in the early 1970s confirmed that Kapilavatthu was a modest settlement, with structures dating from the Buddha's time made of mud walls.
* Later Buddhist legends portray it as a grand royal capital, which is inaccurate.

# Religion and Caste

* The claim that the Buddha was born, raised, and died a Hindu is based on a faulty assumption about ancient Indian religion.
* There is little evidence of brahmin presence in Sakyan territory.
* Brahminism was moving into the Ganges Valley during this period but had not yet significantly influenced the Sakyans.

* The Tipitaka mentions the warrior caste before the brahmin caste, suggesting that clan-based chiefdoms were resisting or ignoring the brahmin concept of caste hierarchy.

# Political Life

* Legend portrays Buddha's father, Suddhodana, as a king, but there is scant evidence in the Tipitaka to support this.
* The term "raja" used for Suddhodana likely referred to an elected chief or consul rather than a king.
* The Sakyans had a body of men called 'chief-makers' (*rājakattāra*) who elected their leader.

* The Buddha was likely from a ruling class family but not royalty in the later sense of the word.

# Family

* Suddhodana had two wives, Mahāmāyā (Buddha's mother) and her sister Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.
* Mahāmāyā died seven days after giving birth to Gotama.

* The Tipitaka mentions six of Buddha's half-brothers and cousins: Ānanda, Anuruddha, Mahānāma, Devadatta, Tissa, and Nanda.

# Buddha's Closeness to Sakyans

* The Buddha addressed lay people as 'householder', ascetics by their clan names, royalty with titles, but used personal names when speaking to his fellow Sakyans.
* He granted Sakyans who became monks a "special privilege" of immediate ordination without the usual four-month probation.

# Birth Stories

* The Pali Tipitaka records almost nothing about Gotama's life before he became an ascetic. Later Buddhist traditions filled in these gaps with stories, including those about his birth.
* These stories often include elements like Mahāmāyā dreaming of a white elephant, giving birth while holding a tree branch, and Gotama emerging from her right side.

* None of these stories are mentioned in the Tipitaka.

# Acchariyābbhūta Sutta

* This discourse, though late, recounts wondrous events surrounding Gotama's birth.
* Some details may be based on fact or have didactic purposes. For example, Mahāmāyā giving birth while standing was not uncommon.

* The story of a brilliant light appearing at his birth is likely an allegory suggesting that the Buddha would enable beings to become aware of each other and foster empathy.

# Lumbini

* Gotama's birthplace, Lumbini, was located in a district of Sakyan lands between Kapilavatthu and Devadaha.
* It was identified in 1896 by an Asokan pillar erected there in 249 BCE.

# The Asita Story

* Asita, a forest ascetic, noticed the gods were jubilant because a special child had been born to the Sakyans.
* He went to see the child, Gotama, and predicted he would become a great spiritual leader.
* Asita also saw that Gotama's life would be marked by both joy and sorrow.

# Gotama's Early Life

* Ancient Indian biographies focused on a person's life after they became an ascetic, not their upbringing.
* Few details are known about Gotama's childhood and youth.
* He was born into a wealthy family and lived a luxurious lifestyle.
* He had a mystical experience while meditating under a jambu tree.

# Gotama's Family

* Gotama married Yasodharā (or Rāhulamātā) in his early teens, as was customary at the time.
* They had one son named Rāhula.
* There is little information about Rāhula until he became a monk.

# The Four Signs

* According to legend, Gotama encountered four signs that changed his life: an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and an ascetic.
* These encounters made him realize the inevitability of aging, sickness, death, and the possibility of transcending them.

# Renunciation

* Gotama decided to renounce his worldly life and become an ascetic.
* He left his home despite his parents' objections.
* His account of this event differs from the traditional legend.


# Seeking a Teacher

* Gotama became a student of Āḷāra Kālāma, who taught him to attain a state of nothingness.
* Gotama quickly mastered this teaching and achieved the desired state.
* However, he was not satisfied and continued his search for enlightenment.

## Uddaka Rāmaputta

* Gotama studied with Uddaka Rāmaputta after Āḷāra Kālāma.
* Uddaka taught meditational practices leading to a state called *nevasaññānāsaññā*.
* Gotama mastered the practice and attained the goal, surprising Uddaka.

## Encounters with Former Disciples

* The Buddha encountered Bharaṇḍu Kālāma, a fellow student from his time with Āḷāra Kālāma.
* He also met Mallan Pukkusa, another disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma.

## Self-Mortification

* Gotama adopted self-mortification (*attakilamatha*) as a path to liberation.
* Theories behind self-mortification included penance, spiritual heat generation, and expunging negative karma.
* Gotama's reasons for choosing this path are unknown.
* He engaged in extreme practices like fasting, eating meager food, sleeping on thorns, and immersing himself in water.

## Physical Deterioration

* Years of self-mortification severely impacted Gotama's physical health.
* His body became emaciated, his skin dried up, and he experienced weakness and pain.

## Mental Discipline

* Alongside physical austerities, Gotama practiced mental control techniques like breath retention meditation (*appāṇakaṃ jhānaṃ*).
* He also attempted to suppress his thoughts through sheer willpower.

## Isolation and Fear

* Gotama sought isolation in the forest, avoiding human contact.
* He faced dangers from wild animals and harassment from cowherd boys.


## Five Companions

* Five *samaṇa*s joined Gotama, impressed by his austerities.
* They hoped to be the first recipients of his teachings upon his enlightenment.
* It is unclear if they constantly accompanied him or visited periodically.

## Reassessment and Abandonment of Austerities

* After years of self-mortification, Gotama realized it was not leading him to liberation.
* He decided to eat solid food again, much to the dismay of his companions who left him.

## Recovery and Journey to Uruvelā

* Gotama recovered his strength by eating properly and resting.
* He traveled through Magadha until he reached Uruvelā, a peaceful riverside village.

# Then, being a seeker for the good

* Gotama arrived at Uruvelā, an army village with a beautiful setting.
* He decided to meditate there, believing it was a good place for striving.

# The Bodhi Tree

* While tradition mentions Gotama meditating under a pipal tree (Bodhi Tree), the Tipitaka gives little attention to this detail.
* It is likely that Gotama sat near such a tree, as they were common in villages and ascetics would often position themselves nearby for offerings or potential interactions with villagers.

# Gotama's Resolve

* Determined to make a breakthrough, Gotama resolved to persist until he attained enlightenment even if it meant his body withered away.
* He recalled a past experience of profound peace from his youth and decided to replicate that state.

# Achieving Jhana States

* Gotama successfully entered and remained in four jhana states, progressively deepening his meditative absorption.
* These states were characterized by intense mindfulness, tranquility, and equanimity.

# Insights Leading to Awakening

* With a focused mind, Gotama gained insights into past lives (pubbenivāsa ñāṇa), the cycle of rebirth (cutūpapāta ñāṇa), and the destruction of mental defilements (āsavakkhaya ñāṇa).
* These insights provided him with a complete understanding of reality and led to his awakening.

# The Appearance of Māra

* During this process, Gotama claimed that Māra, a personification of worldly desires and obstacles, appeared before him.
* He overcame Māra's temptations and attacks through insight and unshakable resolve.

# Not a Mystical Experience

* The Buddha's awakening does not fit the typical definition of a mystical experience as it lacked emotional intensity, was not triggered by stress, and did not involve divine intervention.
* He emphasized that awakening is attainable through human effort and understanding.

# Post-Awakening

* After his awakening, Gotama initially hesitated to teach others, believing they would find his teachings difficult to understand.
* However, Brahmā Sahampati, a deity from the highest heaven, persuaded him to share his wisdom with the world.

# The Buddha's Decision to Teach

* The Buddha contemplated teaching after hearing a plea for him to share his knowledge.
* He surveyed the world and saw beings with varying capacities for understanding, but chose to teach those who recognized the danger of wrongdoing.

# The Buddha's Search for Students

* Initially, the Buddha considered teaching his former teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, but learned they had passed away.
* He then decided to seek out his five former companions in Bārāṇasī.

# Encounter with Upaka

* The Buddha encountered an ascetic named Upaka who was impressed by his demeanor.
* Upaka questioned the Buddha about his teacher and doctrine, to which the Buddha replied that he had no teacher and was unique in the world.
* This claim surprised Upaka, who expressed skepticism but ultimately acknowledged the Buddha's potential.

# Reunion with the Five Companions

* The five ascetics initially planned to ignore the Buddha due to their past disappointment with him.
* However, they were struck by his transformed appearance and offered him respect.
* The Buddha claimed to be fully awakened and capable of guiding them to awakening as well.

# Teaching at Isipatana

* The five companions expressed skepticism about the Buddha's claims but eventually agreed to listen to his teachings.
* Over several days, the Buddha imparted the core principles of Buddhism: the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the concept of non-self.

# The Fate of the Five Monks

* The Buddha instructed the five monks to spread his teachings, but their subsequent activities are largely unknown.
* Assaji and Koṇḍañña are mentioned briefly in later texts, while the other three disappear from the historical record.




# A Teacher Of Gods And Humans

* The Buddha believed himself to be a Buddha and often referred to himself as being an Arahant or a Tathāgata.
* He saw himself primarily as a teacher motivated only by a deep compassion for humanity.
* He reminded his disciples that when he reproached or even scolded them, his motive was always a compassionate concern for their wellbeing.

# The Buddha's Compassion

* The Buddha's compassion was seen as similar to that of a caring and concerned physician who restores an ailing patient to health.
* He was praised as "the healer of the world" and "the compassionate teacher, the supreme physician and surgeon" who extracts the poison arrow of craving.
* The popular perception of the Buddha is that he was a semi-recluse who spent most of his time alone in forest glades and mountain caves.

# The Buddha's Audience

* His audience came from all backgrounds, although typically they were city-dwellers or towns-folk, often from the economic, religious and political class.
* Many of the brahmins he dialogued with were the leaders of their clans and communities or eminent scholars, and a small but significant number of them became his disciples and even monks.

# The Buddha's Dialogues

* The Buddha often engaged in dialogues with one or more of the people who came to hear him or ask him questions, sometimes while those who accompanied the interlocutor listened in.
* These encounters typically began with courteous small talk, during which people found the Buddha "polite, genial and pleasantly spoken, not at all stern, clear-mouthed and first to open the conversation."
* Meetings with brahmins might go like this: Some greeted the Lord and sat down at one side, some greeted him and chatted briefly in a courteous and friendly manner and then sat down, some put their hands together in the añjali gesture and sat down, some announced their names and clan and sat down, and some sat down at one side without saying anything.

## Listen, pay attention and I will speak

* The Buddha would sometimes encourage interlocutors to express their opinions by praising any questions they might ask.
* This encouragement meant that questions and comments kept coming, giving interlocutors the opportunity to express their views and the Buddha the opportunity to formulate his answers in a way that took into account their views.
* Inevitably, towards the end of such a back and forth, the Buddha would fully explain his perspective on whatever subject was being discussed.

## The Buddha often used parables (*upamākathā*) or similes (*upamā*) 

* While presenting some aspect of his Dhamma, he would sometimes add: "I will give you a simile, because intelligent people understand better because of a simile" and then do so.
* They draw on a wide variety of elements, ranging from natural phenomena to travelling, country life, the landscape, business, animal taming, royalty, metallurgy, household articles and duties, to name but a few.

## The Buddha's use of parables: examples

* One famous parable is the Parable of the Raft, which explains that Dhamma is like a raft - useful for crossing the river (reaching awakening) but redundant afterwards.
* Another parable uses the image of crossing a river to make a different point about self-mortification.
* A third riverine parable was used by the Buddha to explain his role in helping humankind to see the problems involved in ordinary conditioned existence.

## An aspect of the Buddha's approach to teaching which rarely gets mentioned is its gentle humour

* His discourses and dialogues are replete with puns, humorous exaggerations, wordplay, irony and occasional satire.
* This style of humour can go right past readers in modern cultures where jokes are telegraphed well in advance, and humour tends to be broad.

## The Buddha's use of humour: example

* When King Ajātasattu asked for an advantage of the monastic life that was observable here and now, the Buddha gave a whimsical answer about how he would treat a runaway slave who became a monk.
* This unexpectedly whimsical answer must have at first surprised the king, but then made him smile.


## Public Debates (*vivāda*)

* The Buddha participated in public debates which were popular events that attracted large crowds.
* Participants were expected to use recognised arguments and adhere to accepted procedures.
* One particular Jain monk named Saccaka was described as "a debater, a clever speaker much esteemed by the general public."
* Saccaka challenged the Buddha to a debate but ended up becoming one of his disciples. 




# Debating Techniques

* Some debaters resorted to trickery and deceit to win.
* They would use fallacious questions or double propositions to confuse opponents.
* One ascetic was known for his numerous arguments against opponents, earning him the title "the Pundit."
* A Buddhist monk named Hatthaka used underhand tactics to appear victorious, even resorting to deception about meeting times and venues.

# The Importance of Audience Perception

* Success in a debate didn't always depend on the truthfulness of one's arguments but also on audience perception.
* An audience might support a proponent with a false doctrine if they silenced an opponent using valid arguments.
* Conversely, a skilled rhetorician who presented strong arguments would be applauded, while the loser mocked.

# The Purpose of Debates

* Not all debates were mere exercises in sophistry; many participants genuinely sought to test their ideas and plumb the truth.
* People attended these events seeking clarification and understanding amidst conflicting doctrines.
* The Buddha advised caution against relying solely on revelation, tradition, hearsay, or appeals to authority.

# The Buddha's Approach to Debates

* Initially, the Buddha avoided debates due to their potential for hostility.
* He was criticized for not defending his philosophy publicly but eventually engaged in discussions and debates as people sought deeper explanations and criticisms arose.
* The Buddha aimed to lead people from ignorance to clarity through reasoned discourse, emphasizing knowledge and understanding over winning arguments or gaining disciples.

* He could have used the Buddha's statements affirming women's capability for awakening and their integral role in the spiritual community.
* There is no rule against ordaining nuns in the Vinaya.

# Alcohol and Gambling

* The Buddha condemned gambling for leading to resentment, financial problems, distrust, social isolation, and potential enslavement in ancient India.

# Entertainment

* While accepting the existence of psychic powers, he cautioned against their display as it could lead to misplaced faith and distract from true virtue and wisdom.

# Caste System

* The Buddha rejected the caste system prevalent in his time, which he saw as arbitrary and based on social constructs rather than inherent qualities.
* He argued that differences between humans should be based on ethical behavior and wisdom, not on birth or social status.
* Within his monastic community, he prohibited discrimination based on caste and emphasized equality among all members.

# Miracles vs. Dhamma

* The increasing number of rules in Buddhism reflected a decline in monk quality.
* Older monks lamented the lower quality of new monks compared to those from earlier times.
* Some monks even expressed relief at the Buddha's death, believing it freed them from restrictions.

# Reasons for Decline

* The respect and admiration shown towards monks by the public led to increased donations and a more comfortable lifestyle.
* This comfort bred complacency and a lack of appreciation for the monastic life's true purpose.
* Some individuals joined the monastic order for selfish reasons, such as free meals or escape from debts.

# Problems with Materialism

* Monks became careless with donated goods, wasting food and demanding unnecessary items.

## Devadatta's Schism

* Devadatta, a Sakyan relative of the Buddha, instigated a schism within the monastic community during the Buddha's final years.
* Devadatta demanded stricter ascetic practices for all monks, including residing in forests, accepting only alms food, wearing rags, and abstaining from meat.
* The Buddha rejected these demands as unsuitable for everyone and not necessarily conducive to inner transformation.

## Devadatta's Challenge

* Devadatta argued that he should replace the Buddha as head of the Saṅgha, claiming the Buddha was too old and worn out.
* This public challenge led to a confrontation where the Buddha rebuked Devadatta harshly.

## The Schism and its Resolution

* Devadatta formed his own sect, causing confusion and division among monks and lay disciples.
* Sāriputta and Moggallāna were sent to reason with Devadatta's followers, ultimately persuading them to return to the Buddha.
* The schism ended, but Devadatta was reportedly enraged by the defection of his followers.

## Devadatta's Motivations

* The Buddha and his party arrived in Nādikā, a small village on the southern outskirts of Vesālī.
* Ambapālī, a courtesan, invited the Buddha and monks for a meal after hearing of their arrival.
* A group of young Licchavis also wanted to offer hospitality but were refused by the Buddha as he had already accepted Ambapālī's invitation.

##  Ambapālī's Generosity

* The Buddha and his monks went to Ambapālī's house for a meal, after which she donated her mango orchard to the Saṅgha.
* Ambapālī later became a nun and composed a poem comparing her beauty in her prime with how she looked in old age.
* The Buddha's acceptance of Ambapālī's invitation has been likened to Jesus' forgiveness of 'the sinful woman'.

##  The Rainy Season Sickness

* Shortly after arriving in Vesālī, the rainy season began and the Buddha became severely ill.
* Ānanda expressed his concern that the Buddha would pass away without making a statement regarding the monastic Saṅgha.
* The Buddha reassured Ānanda that he had proclaimed the Dhamma openly and did not hold back any teachings.

##  Self-Reliance in Spiritual Matters

* The Buddha emphasized the importance of self-reliance in spiritual matters, stating that individuals should be their own refuge with the Dhamma as their guide.
* He reiterated his appeal for people to attain enlightenment through their own efforts.

##  The Final Journey

* After the rainy season, the party set off again, heading north and eventually arriving at Pāvā.
* Cunda, a blacksmith, welcomed them and invited them to a meal.

## The Last Meal

* During the meal, the Buddha ate a dish called *sūkaramaddava*, after which he became severely ill with bloody diarrhoea and sharp pain.
* This turned out to be his last meal, leading to much speculation about the identity of the dish and its role in his death.
* Theories include accidental poisoning or bacterial gastroenteritis from contaminated food or water.

# The Buddha's Final Days

* The Buddha was likely sick due to old age and gastroenteritis exacerbated by exhaustion rather than his last meal.
* He continued his journey despite increasing weakness, resting at various locations along the way.
* A man named Pukkusa offered him robes, causing the Buddha to radiate light, a phenomenon that had only happened once before during his awakening.

# The Journey Continues

* After resting by the Kakuṭṭhā River, the Buddha asked Cundaka to prepare a bed for him near Kusinārā.
* He instructed Ānanda to inform the blacksmith Cunda that providing his last meal was a meritorious act, showcasing his compassion even in his final moments.
* Upon arriving at Kusinārā, the Buddha lay down between two sal trees which spontaneously burst into blossom, signifying his reverence.

# Final Teachings and Passing

* The Buddha gave final advice to his disciples, encouraging them to visit four significant sites and offering instructions on monastic life.
* He comforted a tearful Ānanda, expressing gratitude for his service and assuring him of his future progress.
* Ānanda informed the Mallas of the Buddha's impending death, leading to shock and consternation amongst the crowd.

# Subhadda's Ordination

* A wandering ascetic named Subhadda requested an audience with the Buddha and was granted ordination.
* He attained awakening soon after, demonstrating the Buddha's unwavering commitment to teaching until his last breath.

# The Final Words

* The Buddha declared that all conditioned things are impermanent and urged his followers to strive on with awareness.
* He entered a state of deep meditation and passed away peacefully.

# Aftermath

* The monks mourned the Buddha's passing, while some Mallas prepared for an elaborate funeral ceremony.
* Mahā Kassapa and other monks learned of the Buddha's death while traveling and hurried to Kusinārā.




# The Buddha's Funeral and the First Council

* After the Buddha's death, his body was cremated in Kusinārā. 
* Eight claimants from various kingdoms and clans disputed over the Buddha's remains.
* A brahmin named Doṇa arbitrated the dispute, dividing the remains into eight portions.

# The First Buddhist Council

* Following the Buddha's death, Mahā Kassapa proposed a council to preserve his teachings. 
* Several hundred monks gathered in Rājagaha for the council.
* The council was led by Mahā Kassapa, Ānanda, and Upāli.
* The council likely involved memorizing and organizing the Buddha's discourses.

# Spreading the Dharma

* Even before the Buddha's death, monks were spreading his teachings to distant regions. 
* After the First Council, missionary efforts intensified, leading to Buddhism's spread throughout India and beyond.

# Appendix Ii The Buddha And The Upaniṣads

* Kamma and rebirth are central to Buddhism but misunderstood by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.
* A common misconception is that these doctrines were universally accepted in ancient India, and the Buddha simply adopted them.
* This assumption is problematic because evidence is unclear and it undermines the idea of the Buddha's Dhamma as a personal realization.

# The Evidence Against Widespread Acceptance of Kamma and Rebirth in Ancient India

* The Tipitaka shows kamma and rebirth were not widely accepted in 5th century BCE India.
* Brahmins continued Vedic funeral rites, believing in heaven after death.
* Some teachers denied kamma and rebirth, considering them new or lacking empirical evidence.

# Kamma and Rebirth in the Vedas

* The Vedas, foundational scriptures of Brahminism and Hinduism, show no knowledge of kamma or rebirth in their original sense.
* *Kamma* (Sanskrit *karma*) referred to working, doing, or performing Vedic rituals.
* After death, individuals went to the world of fathers (*pitṛloka*), sustained by offerings from their sons.

# Kamma and Rebirth in the Upanishads

* To argue the Buddha borrowed from the Upanishads, they must predate him, be accessible to him, and teach similar concepts of kamma and rebirth.
* While some early Upanishads likely predate the Buddha, there's no record of him visiting regions where they were taught.
* Upanishadic doctrines were secret, meant for initiates only, making it unlikely the Buddha would have known them.

# Kamma and Rebirth Concepts in Specific Upanishads

* The *Kauṣītaki* describes a post-mortem journey to the moon, where individuals answer questions determining their next form based on kamma (possibly Vedic rituals).
* The *Chāndogya* presents a similar cycle but emphasizes rebirth through plants consumed by humans.
* The *Bṛhadāraṇyaka* offers various destinies after death, some involving moral causation (kamma) presented as a secret teaching.

* Other passages in the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka* deny kamma and assert traditional Vedic beliefs about sons ensuring a favorable afterlife.


# Conclusion

* The Upanishads' concept of 'rebirth' is more accurately described as transference or transmission, with no resemblance to Buddhist or Jain doctrines.
* While some Upanishads mention kamma and rebirth, they do so tentatively and vaguely.

# The Origin of Kamma and Rebirth in Buddhism

* No Vedic text definitively explains what happens after death.
* Some Upanishads mention kamma and rebirth but present them as one of many possibilities.
* It's possible that the Buddha was influenced by Jainism, which had a developed concept of kamma and rebirth, but he didn't simply adopt it wholesale.

# The Integration of Kamma and Rebirth into Hinduism

* By the first millennium CE, ideas about kamma and rebirth were being integrated into Hinduism.
* However, these ideas were not universally accepted and often clashed with other Hindu doctrines.
* Some Hindu movements rejected kamma in favor of fate or predetermined destiny.
* Many Hindu texts offer contradictory explanations for rebirth and how it functions.

# The Clarity of Buddhist Teachings on Kamma and Rebirth

* The Caraka Samhita acknowledges the diversity of beliefs about rebirth, even within Hinduism.
* Hinduism presents multiple, often conflicting, theories about kamma and rebirth.
* In contrast, Buddhism offers a clear, consistent, and fully developed doctrine of kamma and rebirth that harmonizes with its other teachings.
