# Buddhism Consists Of The Ëthree Jewelsí: The Buddha, The Dhamma And The Sa∆gha. They Are Also Known As The Ëthree Refugesí

* Buddhists rely on the Three Jewels and place trust in them.
* Though many dislike calling Buddhism a 'faith,' it is not unfair to say that Buddhists have faith in the Three Jewels.

# Buddha(S/P)

* "Buddha" is a title meaning "Awakened" or "Enlightened."
* His family name was Gotama (P).
* Non-Buddhists see him as the founder of Buddhism, but Buddhists believe he re-founded it in their time and place.
* Other Buddhas do the same when and where Buddhism is extinct.

# Dhamma (P) or Dharma(S)

* Refers to what the Buddha taught.
* Can be translated as "law of the universe," both descriptive and normative.
* Means "Buddhism" if referring to the system of ideas.
* *Saåsana* (P) or *‹åsana* (S) refers to Buddhism as a historical phenomenon, meaning "teaching" or "dispensation."

# Sa∆gha(S/P)

* Means "community."
* Originally referred to followers who reached the first stage of spiritual progress.
* Commonly refers to ordained monks, nuns, and novices.
* Governed by *Vinaya* ("discipline").

# The Buddhist Canon

* Consists of three main parts:
    1. *Vinaya Pi¢aka*: Rules for the Sa∆gha.
        * Includes *påtimokkha* (P)/ *pråtimok¶a* (S), the individual disciplinary codes.
    2. *Sutta Pi¢aka*: Collection of Buddha's teachings, including sermons and narratives.
        * Organized into four *Nikåya*.
    3. *Abhidhamma Pi¢aka*: "Higher teachings," analytically arranged and systematic.

# HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND

* The Buddha lived before writing was used in India, so dating his life is difficult.
* He likely died around 405 BC.
* Emperor Asoka (c.269 to c.231 BC) played a key role in spreading Buddhism.
* The Buddha was born near the modern border of India and Nepal.
* He lived in northeastern India, primarily Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh.

# Social environment

* The Buddha lived during the rise of cities in India.
* A complex religious and cultural system existed, led by brahmins.
* New political and mercantile classes challenged brahmin authority, supporting heterodox teachers like Mahavira (founder of Jainism).

# Brahmin religion and society

* Brahmins believed in a hierarchical caste system with four strata:
    1. Brahmins (priests)
    2. Kshatriyas (nobility)
    3. Vaishyas (traders)
    4. Shudras (artisans and laborers)

* Outcastes were below these groups, associated with unclean work.
* Early brahmin religious literature is vast and known as the Vedas.
* The Upanishads are later texts within this tradition.

# Kinds of Buddhism

* Two main traditions: Theravada ("Doctrine of the Elders") and Mahayana ("Great Path" or "Great Vehicle").
* Theravada considers only the Pali Canon authoritative.
* Mahayana arose around the beginning of the Christian era and venerates many other texts.





# MISUNDERSTANDING AND PSEUDO-PROFUNDITY

* The author finds the Buddha's ideas powerful and intelligent but believes they are often misunderstood as being complex and difficult. 
* Traditional exegesis of the Buddha's teachings has largely ignored his historical context, leading to misinterpretations.
* The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical context of the Buddha's teachings.

# THE BUDDHAíS USE OF METAPHOR

* The Buddha often used metaphor and allegory in his sermons, known as *pariyåya*.
* Early *abhidharma* texts claim to present the Buddha's meaning literally, contrasting with the figurative language of the *sutta*s.
* The author aims to decode the Buddha's metaphors while recognizing their importance for understanding his message.

# Skill in Means

* The Buddha's use of metaphor is linked to his "Skill in Means" (S: *upåyakau‹alya*), which refers to his ability to adapt his communication to different audiences.
* He often agreed with his interlocutors before subtly shifting their perspectives by redefining their words and concepts.
* This technique, exemplified by his use of "Yes ... and ...", demonstrates a diplomatic approach that avoids confrontation. 




# The Way in Which the Buddha Infuses New Meaning into Accepted Terms

* The Buddha redefined common terms, sometimes drastically, to convey new meanings within his teachings.
* He redefined "karma," originally meaning "action" or "deed," as "intention," highlighting the importance of mental states in shaping one's destiny.

# DECODING AN IDEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE

* Understanding Buddhist texts requires going beyond literal translations and exploring the semantic range of key terms.
* The Buddha's doctrine of No Self (Anatta) is often misunderstood due to cultural differences in understanding the concept of "self."
* A clearer interpretation emphasizes the absence of an unchanging essence, highlighting the impermanent nature of all phenomena.

# KARMA AS PERSONAL CONTINUITY

* Karma is a central tenet in Buddhism, explaining personal continuity and moral responsibility across multiple lifetimes.
* The Buddha's view of karma contrasts with the idea of a soul as the locus of good and evil, instead emphasizing the consequences of actions driven by intention.
* Buddhists believe in an infinite cycle of rebirth, determined by karma, until nirvana is attained, ending the cycle.

## # INTRODUCTION

* The text explores key concepts in Buddhism, particularly focusing on karma and the idea of "no soul".
* It argues that understanding these concepts requires considering them within the broader context of Buddhist teachings.
* The Buddha's emphasis on individual responsibility and ethical volition is highlighted.

## # INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND RESPONSIBILITY

* Buddhism emphasizes individual autonomy and personal conscience as the ultimate authority in moral decision-making.
* There is no external agent like a God who takes blame for our actions; we are wholly responsible for ourselves.
* This responsibility extends beyond this life, encompassing our moral condition and its consequences.

## # WHY HAVE I STARTED HERE?

* The author chose to begin with the concepts of "no soul" and karma as entry points into understanding the Buddha's core teachings.
* This approach contrasts with the traditional starting point of the Four Noble Truths, which address suffering.
* The author explains this choice by highlighting the pre-existing beliefs of the Buddha's audience, who held assumptions about rebirth, a central enduring entity, and the cycle of life and death.

## # SUMMARY: DID ONE PERSON REALLY THINK OF ALL THIS?




# The Idea Of Rebirth. He Saw Karma, Intentional Action, As A Matter

* Good karma would bring good effects for the doer, bad karma bad effects.
* These are not rewards and punishments, but results produced by a law of nature.
* For the Buddha and others in ancient India, the model was agriculture.

# MORE ABOUT KARMA, AND ITS SOCIAL CONTEXT 

* Karma works as a theodicy by claiming that the explanation for both triumphant rogues and suffering babies lies in what they have done in former lives.
* For karma to work as an ethical doctrine, it must steer between the extremes of determinism and randomness.
* The Buddha condemned determinist doctrines but also insisted on consequences for actions.

* Karma operates on a grand scale, determining where one is born and when one dies. 
* Karma must operate through some specific cause; it is the cause behind causes.
* People tend to apply the theory backwards: when one has an illness and no treatment seems to do any good, one starts saying that this must be an effect of bad karma.

#  The Buddha's Teaching on Karma 


* The Buddha himself listed the effects of karma as one of the four things which are not to be thought about because thinking about them will drive you crazy.
* He witnessed the workings of karma, but we cannot.
* What he saw convinced him that nothing could be as urgent as putting a stop to the whole process.

# The Social Context of Buddhism's Emergence

* The Buddha’s teaching of individual responsibility took root in a large segment of society due to exceptional circumstances.
* These circumstances included India's second period of urbanization, which led to radical changes in society and the economy.
* Surplus agricultural production led to trade, contact with more distant societies, and a broadening of cultural horizons.

* The existence of new classes in the Gangetic basin of the sixth century is undeniable. 
* Free peasants and farmers were one class.
* Trade gave the farmers an incentive to produce a surplus.

## # KARMA THEORYíS BEARING ON SOCIETY AND COSMOLOGY

* Karma theory makes the universe an ethical arena where everyone is placed according to their deserts.
* This view correlates power and goodness, with gods being more powerful due to their virtue.
* Humans are better off than animals and demons, who act as punitive agents but are punished for exceeding their role.
* This view offers reassurance but can be harsh as it denies undeserved suffering.

## # THE ANTECEDENTS OF THE KARMA DOCTRINE IN BRAHMINISM

* This chapter will explore the earlier Indian ideas of rebirth and karma that influenced the Buddha's teachings, specifically focusing on Brahminism.
* Other aspects of Brahminism that influenced the Buddha will be discussed in Chapter 5.




## The Antecedents Of The Karma Doctrine In Brahminism 29 ❧ Chapter 3

* Until recently, scholars believed the *°Rg Veda* showed no signs of rebirth. They thought people went to join their ancestors in the sun after death. This idea was based on a misinterpretation of the "Funeral Hymn," RV X.16.
* Joanna Jurewicz's research shows this interpretation is wrong. The hymn actually refers to rebirth, aligning with Gananath Obeyesekere's findings about rebirth beliefs in small-scale societies.

## Rebirth in Small-Scale Societies

* A belief in rebirth exists in many small-scale societies but usually follows a simple pattern:
    * People oscillate between this world and another very similar one.
    * Rebirth is unrelated to ethical conduct; rewards and punishments occur in this life.

## Ethicization of Rebirth

* As societies grow larger, justice may not always be served in this life. This leads to the ethicization of rebirth:
    * Moral actions become religiously significant, affecting destiny after death.
    * Delayed punishments and rewards are introduced, unlike immediate compensations from deities or ancestors.

## Rebirth in the *°Rg Veda*

* Jurewicz's translation of the "Funeral Hymn" reveals a belief in rebirth aligned with Obeyesekere's model:
    * The dead person joins their ancestors but returns to this world through rain, taking on a new body and rejoining their family.

## Differences Between *°Rg Veda* Rebirth and Later Theories

* In the *°Rg Veda*, rebirth involves only two worlds and is unrelated to karma or ethical actions.
* Later theories introduce a binary cosmology:
    * This world (karmabhµumi) is for action, while the other world (bhoga-bhµumi) is for experiencing consequences.
* Indian religions add the concept of escaping the cycle of rebirth, which constitutes salvation.

## Three Destinies at Death

* Indian religions recognize three possible destinies: heaven, hell, and liberation from rebirth.

## Liberation (*mok¶a* or *mukti*)

* Liberation is seen as the ultimate goal because it ends the cycle of rebirth (sa√såra).
* It is often metaphorically described as freedom from slavery or imprisonment.

## Ethics vs. Ritual

* Buddhism and Jainism clearly distinguish between ethics and ritual, emphasizing morality's importance for soteriology.
* Brahminism and Hinduism have not made this distinction as decisively, with karma primarily referring to ritual acts.

## The Binary Cosmology

* Humans and higher animals are moral agents who go to heaven or hell after death based on their actions.
* This system is primarily focused on the results of actions in this life.
* Exceptions exist, such as gods being punished for sins or *asuras* being rewarded for virtuous acts.
* Most people aim for rebirth in a good place, with escape from rebirth seen as difficult but ideal.

## Early Jainism

* The earliest form of Jain doctrine considers all karma to be bad because almost all actions involve harming living beings.
* Karma weighs down the life monad (*j∂va*) preventing it from attaining liberation.
* While a better rebirth is possible through good karma, the idea of gradual progression towards liberation is largely absent.

## Buddhism

* Buddhism ethicizes the entire universe, making all sentient beings morally responsible for their actions and potential rebirth in higher or lower stations.
* Some minor inconsistencies remain, but they are not significant to the overall concept.
* While Buddhism supersedes the binary model, remnants of it can be found in certain verses and prose discourse.

## The Buddha's View on Karma

* The Buddha likely focused primarily on the morals of those living on earth.
* The idea that gods also act as moral agents may have emerged later with the practice of transferring merit to them.

## Rebirth and Karma in the Bæhad-åraƒyaka Upani¶ad

* This text presents a binary cosmology where the self (*åtman*) transmigrates between this world and another.
* An early mention of karma suggests that actions lead to good or bad outcomes.
* The concept of escaping rebirth through the elimination of desires is introduced.
* The "five fire wisdom" provides a more elaborate ethicized account of rebirth, emphasizing gnosis as the path to liberation.

## Macrocosm and Microcosm

* Brahmin thought explored the correspondence between the human individual (microcosm) and the universe (macrocosm).
* This concept also extended to an intermediate level, the mesocosm, represented by the sacrifice.
* Understanding these correspondences was a key aspect of brahminical esoteric knowledge.

# The Word *åtman*

* The word *åtman* is possibly connected to the German verb *atmen* meaning "to breathe."
* It was originally a Sanskrit reflexive pronoun, translatable as "self" in appropriate contexts.
* This "self" was reified and considered the core of each living being.

# Brahman and Brahmå

* *Brahman*, originally referring to the Vedas, became the term for ultimate reality in Upanishads.
* It is the spirit immanent in both the universe and individuals.
* *Brahman* is neuter and has no plural.
* There's also a masculine god called Brahman (*Brahmå*) who is the creator god.

# The Five Fire Wisdom

* This cosmology describes three groups of people after death.
* The first group, those with knowledge of the five fire wisdom, attain liberation and reside in worlds of *brahman*.
* The second group, those who perform sacrifices and rituals, are reborn according to their actions.
* The third group, those without knowledge or ritual observance, become worms, insects, or snakes.

# Karma and Intention

* The concept of karma is present in the five fire wisdom, but not explicitly as "karma."
* The *Bæhad-åraƒyaka* suggests that good actions are done without desire, which aligns with Buddhist thought.
* However, the Buddha redefined *puƒya karma*, originally meaning "purifying act," as morally good action based on intention.

# Jainism and Buddhism

* Jainism may have already ethicized and universalized karma before Buddhism.
* The next chapter will explore this further.

# Jain Influence on the Buddha

* The author believes that early Jainism significantly influenced Buddhism.
* Both religions share similarities, including a belief in re-founders who appear periodically to guide humanity towards enlightenment.
* Jainism calls these figures *T∂rtha√kara*, meaning "ford-makers," who help beings cross the ocean of *sa√såra*, the cycle of rebirth.

# The Nature of Early Jainism

* Jainism likely predates Mahåv∂ra, who is traditionally considered its founder.
*  Mahåv∂ra's predecessor, Pår‹va, also had a community of followers.
* Mahåv∂ra emphasized monastic asceticism, including nudity, which may have been a new development in Jainism.

# Sources and Challenges

* Jain texts are scarce and difficult to date accurately.
* The Digambara and ›vetåmbara branches of Jainism disagree on the authenticity of certain texts.
* Buddhist texts provide valuable insights into early Jainism before the split between these two branches.

# Karma and Rebirth in Early Jainism

*  Jainism emphasizes karma and rebirth, with all living beings trapped in *sa√såra*, a cycle of death and rebirth.
* Jainism embraces hylozoism, believing that all matter contains sentient life (*j∂va*) which can experience pain. 
* Karma binds *j∂va* to *sa√såra*. Every action attracts "dust" that weighs down the soul.

# Ahimsa: The Paramount Ethical Principle

* Jainism's emphasis on non-violence (ahimsa) stems from hylozoism.
* Even seemingly inanimate objects contain *j∂va*, capable of suffering.
* This leads to extreme asceticism, minimizing harm through restricted activity and ultimately self-starvation.

# Early Jainism vs. Buddhism

* Early Jainism focuses on avoiding all action as it inevitably causes harm and binds the soul.
* Buddhism, while emphasizing non-violence, acknowledges the importance of intention (karma) and allows for meritorious actions leading to better rebirths.




## Injury is Injury

*  The Buddha's insistence on calling action intention was likely a direct response to Jainism.
* The doctrine that everything important happens in the mind aligns with the Buddha's teachings.

## Jain Influence on Buddhism

* Several texts show the Buddha interacting with Jain followers, suggesting a significant influence.
* The Buddha's Middle Way, condemning mortification of the flesh, alludes to Jain asceticism.
* Scholars have largely overlooked the potential influence of older Jainism on Buddhism.

## Positive Jain Influence

* Early Jainism emphasized ethical and compassionate roots in its doctrine of *ahi√så*.
* Jainism may be credited with the first ethicized karma theory, which Buddhism later refined.
* Buddhists and Jains shared opposition to Vedic animal sacrifice.

## Areas of Agreement and Disagreement

* The Buddha accepted three core Jain doctrines: *sa√såra*, the desirability of escaping it, and the role of ethics in achieving liberation.
* He rejected the existence of life-monads, unlike Jainism.
* Buddhists believed plants were insentient, while Jains considered them to have one sense organ.

## Buddha's Reaction Against Jain Practices

* The Buddha disapproved of Jain monks' lifestyles and wanted to distinguish his monks from them.
* He allowed monks to use anything for covering nakedness and ask for robes when necessary, unlike Jains who relied on bare hands for receiving food.
* The Buddha permitted monks to request replacement begging bowls, contrasting with Jain practice.

## Influence on Monastic Rules

* Public expectations of renunciates, likely shaped by Jain practices, influenced the Buddhist Sa∆gha.
* The Buddha established a rains retreat for monks due to concerns about harming insects while traveling.
* A monastic rule against destroying plants reflects the Buddha's adaptation of inherited material and public criticism.

## Influence on the Order of Nuns

* The Buddha likely learned from Jainism the concept of an Order of nuns.
* Evidence in the *Thera-ther∂-gåthå* suggests former Jains joined the Buddhist Sa∆gha, including a nun ordained simply by the Buddha saying "Come."
* This supports the theory that the Buddha established his Order of nuns early on, possibly influenced by the existing Jain Order.

## Shared Practices and Terminology

* The Pali record mentions Jains converting to Buddhism but not vice versa, which doesn't necessarily mean it didn't happen.
* The Buddhist term *påtimokkha*, referring to monastic rules and confession ceremonies, may have Jain origins.




# The Buddha's Debt to Jainism

* The Buddha modeled his monastic order after the Jains, requiring regular confession meetings.
* The term "åsava" (corruptions), used by the Buddha to describe impurities hindering enlightenment, may have been borrowed from Jain terminology.
* The concept of "knowing and seeing" (¤åƒa-dassana) for attaining nirvana might also be influenced by Jain ideas.

# The Buddha's Rejection of Jain Practices

* The Buddha experimented with extreme austerities practiced by Jains but ultimately rejected them, favoring the middle way.
* He emphasized internal mental processes over external actions, a departure from Jain focus on physical karma.

# The Buddha's Innovations in Karma and Rebirth

* The Buddha introduced symmetry between good and bad karma, potentially influenced by brahminism.
* He prioritized intention as the determining factor in karmic consequences, a concept later adopted by Jainism.

# Contrasting Buddhist and Jain Approaches to Abstraction

* Jains concretized abstract concepts like karma, while the Buddha emphasized mental perception of abstractions.
* The Buddha's approach to abstraction was sometimes crude, but he recognized the mind's role in perceiving abstract ideas.

# Conclusion: Jain Influence on Buddhism

* While reacting against certain aspects of Jainism, the Buddha incorporated and transformed key Jain concepts like karma, rebirth, and non-violence.
* Jain influence is often overlooked in discussions of Buddhist origins.




# Highlighting Two Of His Ideas: The First Noble Truth, That

* The Buddha's idea that "everything is suffering" has led to comparisons with Stoicism and Schopenhauer.
* The teaching of "No Soul or No Self" is often compared to David Hume's philosophy.

# In order to make himself understood, the Buddha had to talk in terms with which his audiences were already familiar. 

* He primarily alluded to teachings in the early Upanishads, especially the BÅU.
* Some of these teachings he agreed with; others he criticized.

# In ancient India the belief in rebirth added to the questions: What exists? How do we know anything? What is it that continues from life to life?

* The *°Rg Veda* X, 129 suggests existence and consciousness originate together.
* This idea became fundamental for brahminical and Hindu thought.

# If the function of a ghost is to act as a vehicle for the characteristics of someone who no longer exists, being dead, it needs to be at the same time material and immaterial.

* The term "soul" is often used interchangeably with "ghost."
* There is less agreement about the soul than there is about ghosts.

# In fact it *does*, in my experience, often mislead people, because they tend to understand it as denying a principle of continuity.

* As explained in the Introduction, that is totally wrong, for in Buddhism there is an extremely strong principle of continuity ñ which is karma.
* I therefore try to avoid using the word "soul" in discussing the topic.

# The Jains had a coherent theory of the mechanism of transmigration, which also explained how karma carried over from one life to the next.

* The essential component of a living being is called the *j∂va*, literally "life."
* Karma clings to the *j∂va*, which is sticky, and stays there until it is expunged by austerities.

# In other ideologies the self which endures through a series of lives which ends only with liberation is called the *puru¶a*.

* The term *puru¶a*, however, is of Vedic origin, and occasionally in the Upani¶ads the term is used to refer to the individual *åtman*.
* Brahmins, however, came to regard the *åtman* as something so radically different from the empirical self that it could never be involved with (or sullied by) karma.

# ÅTMAN/BRAHMAN IN THE IN THE BÅU

* Straight after the passage just alluded to, in which the self oscillates between this world and the next via dreams, Yåj¤avalkya gives an account of dying.
* The text goes on to say that the åtman is *brahman* and as such consists of everything (*sarva-maya*)

# Brahman is existence. This reification of existence goes back to the ëCreation Hymní, and is of course found in many philosophies round the world.




# Philosophical Level, However, He Rejects The Reification Of Ëbeingí.

* The Buddha accepted the concept of "being" as opposed to "change" or "becoming."
* He rejected the idea of "being" as a concrete entity, seeing it instead as a process.

# THE BUDDHAíS ANSWER TO ëBEING, CONSCIOUSNESS, BLISSí 

* The Buddha agreed with the Upaniṣads that the world is constantly changing and therefore not blissful but filled with suffering (dukkha).
* He also agreed that concepts like change and suffering only make sense in contrast to their opposites.
*  He believed experiencing these opposites could lead to liberation from rebirth, which he called nirvana.

# IMPERMANENCE 




## Alas, Compounded Things Are Impermanent, Of A Nature To Arise And Pass Away. After Arising, They Are Destroyed; Their Calming Is Happiness.

* This verse emphasizes the impermanence of all things, a core Buddhist principle.
* The Buddha taught that everything, even mountains, is subject to arising, passing away, and change.
* Commentaries sometimes misinterpreted this to mean things go through three distinct phases.


## ANCESTORS AND GHOSTS

* Buddhism adapted earlier concepts of the soul by eliminating the need for an entity carrying karma between lives.
* Despite the introduction of rebirth, rituals honoring ancestors persisted in India.
* The Buddha allowed laity to continue mortuary rituals but didn't endorse them.
* The concept of "hungry ghosts" (petas) arose from a need for reassurance about death and cultural beliefs.

## THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN EMOTION AND UNDERSTANDING

* Early Indian philosophy grappled with questions of existence, knowledge, and continuity after death.
* The Buddha focused on experience rather than abstract concepts, emphasizing processes over things.
* Karma, meaning "doing," was seen as the principle of continuity from moment to moment and life to life.
* The Buddha saw transience as the root of suffering and advocated for acceptance of impermanence.

## THE BUDDHAíS POSITIVE VALUES: LOVE AND COMPASSION




# Simultaneously Several Different Dimensions Of The Buddhaís Thought And Teaching; One Of Them I Regard As Of Central Importance.

* This chapter outlines the author's method for understanding the Buddha's teachings. 
* The author emphasizes the importance of historical context, ethics, metaphor, and abstraction in interpreting the Buddha's words.

# SOPHISTICATION

* The author uses the example of Christian depictions of God to illustrate the concept of sophistication.
* Sophistication involves moving from literal interpretations to more abstract and nuanced understandings.
* This concept is applied to understanding the Buddha's engagement with brahminical ideas about Brahman.

# THE FOUR BOUNDLESS STATES

* The Buddha highly commended four states of mind: kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity.
* These are called "the boundless" (*apramāna*) and *brahma-vihara*.
* The term *brahma-vihara* connects these states to brahminical concepts of salvation through union with Brahman.



## The Buddha's Redefinition of "Three Knowledges"

* The term *te-vijja*, meaning "having three knowledges," was traditionally used by brahmins to refer to knowledge of the three Vedas (*Rg, Såma*, and *Yajur Veda*).
* The Buddha redefined these "three knowledges" as:
    * Knowledge of one's former births.
    * Knowledge of the rebirths of others.
    * Knowledge that one's corruptions have been eliminated.

## The Buddha's Dialogue with Brahmins in the *Tevijja Sutta*

* Two young brahmins, seeking companionship with Brahma, engage in a conversation with the Buddha.
* The Buddha teases them about their claims of knowing the way to Brahma, highlighting their lack of understanding compared to their knowledge of worldly things like the sun and moon.
* He contrasts the moral imperfections of real brahmins with the idealized image they have of Brahma.

## The Path to Companionship with Brahma

* The Buddha describes a path to companionship with Brahma that is open to anyone, regardless of birth.
* This path involves:
    * Renouncing household life and following Buddhist precepts.
    * Cultivating boundless love, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.
* These qualities are described as "release of the mind" (*ceto-vimutti*) and lead to the elimination of finite karma.

## The Buddha's Reinterpretation of Upaniadic Doctrine

* The Buddha adapts Upaniadic concepts like *brahman* and the five fire wisdom to present a path accessible to brahmins.
* He emphasizes that true gnosis involves ethical transformation, symbolized by the boundless states, rather than mere intellectual understanding.
* The Buddha's use of Upaniadic language is likely intended to bridge the gap between existing beliefs and Buddhist teachings.

## The Significance of the *Tevijja Sutta*

* The *Tevijja Sutta*'s placement within the *S∂la-kkhandha* section of the *D∂gha Nikåya* suggests a connection between moral conduct and the practice of boundless states.
* This sutta challenges traditional interpretations of spiritual progress by presenting the boundless states as a path to liberation that transcends the limitations of conventional meditative practices.




# The Pali word for the first state is *mettå*.

* The Pali word for the first state, *mettå*, can be translated as "loving kindness" but this translation may not accurately capture its meaning. 
*  The author prefers to use both "love" and "kindness" interchangeably.
* Kindness and compassion are closely related concepts.

# To our way of thinking, kindness and compassion are almost the same

* The Theravada tradition emphasizes kindness while the Mahayana stresses compassion, but there is no significant difference in substance.
* Empathizing with the happiness of others is a distinctive Buddhist concept.

# It is the relation between the first three states and the fourth which we probably find the most puzzling

*  The ideal relationship between love/compassion and equanimity involves purging attachment.
* This can be compared to the professional ethos expected of doctors, who must balance benevolence with detachment.

# OTHER TEXTS EXTOLLING KINDNESS AND COMPASSION

* The *Metta Sutta* is a Pali poem that exemplifies and extols having kind thoughts towards all beings. 
* It suggests that cultivating kindness can lead to enlightenment and escape from the cycle of rebirth.

# The poem does not clearly state that kindness *alone* will produce salvific results

* Other virtues are also mentioned as being important for attaining liberation.


# There is yet another text in the canon in which the Buddha preaches the importance of kindness by making a playful allusion to a passage in the *Bæhad-åraƒyaka Upani¶ad*.

* The Buddha uses the example of Yajnavalkya's teaching on self-love to argue that because everyone loves themselves, they should not harm others.


# THE TRADITIONAL, LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE *TEVIJJA SUTTA*

* Despite other texts suggesting kindness can be salvific, the traditional interpretation of the *Tevijja Sutta* holds that practicing the *brahma-vihåra*s leads to rebirth in the Brahma realm. 


## World, But No Higher. This Being So, A Fortiori There Had To Exist A Part Of The Universe That Was The Brahma World! I Am By No Means

* The text discusses the Buddhist concept of *brahma*-worlds, which are higher realms of existence beyond the ordinary heavens (*deva*-worlds).
* These *brahma*-worlds are thought to be a result of the Buddha's dialogue with brahmins and their cosmology.
* The author suggests that the non-returner (*anågåm∂*), a stage in Buddhist attainment, originates from the same source as the *brahma*-world concept.

## Assessing the Evidence
A BOGUS SUBJECT

* The author argues against the idea of "methodology" as a distinct subject of study.
* They believe that the method used for research should depend on the specific circumstances of the case.
* The author cites examples from science and art history to support their view, emphasizing the importance of individual talent, creativity, and collaboration.



## COPING WITH SCEPTICISM

* Some scholars dismiss ancient texts as untrustworthy without scrutinizing the evidence.
* Intellectual honesty demands evaluating each case on its merits, treating sources as innocent until proven guilty.
* While no ultimate defense against skepticism exists, dismissing all sources is unproductive.
* The Pali chronicles, while not providing definitive proof, offer a consistent story with a better chance of accuracy than other theories.

## IS THERE BETTER EVIDENCE FOR THE EARLIEST BUDDHISM THAN THE PALI CANON?

* Some scholars advocate for using inscriptions over texts, but inscriptions are also texts and lack inherent superiority.
* Relevant inscriptions for early Buddhism are scarce, leaving the Pali Canon as the primary source.
* Non-Buddhist texts offer limited insights into the Buddha himself, mainly reflecting later Buddhist influences.
* While comparing Pali versions with other translations is valuable, most differences are trivial and don't significantly alter interpretations.
* The Pali version of the *sutta*s and *Vinaya* remains the oldest and most reliable evidence for understanding early Buddhism. 


# How did these documents originate and how well have they survived the passing of time?

* Most Pali manuscripts were copied in the 18th and 19th centuries.
* Some older manuscripts exist, dating back to the 16th century in northern Thailand.
* A manuscript from c. 800 AD shows a language identical to later manuscripts, suggesting early stabilization of the text.

# According to the Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka

* The Canon was first written down in the 1st century BC.
* Some texts may have been written earlier, but the original language is unknown.
* Writing down the Canon likely stabilized it and defined what was considered canonical.

# THE EARLIEST ORAL TRADITION

* The date of the Pali canonical texts' first writing is less important than the reliability of transmission before that date.
* Texts recording Buddha's sermons were formulated at the First Council, shortly after his death.
* This council involved reciting suttas by Ananda and Vinaya by Upali, who then rehearsed them with other monks.

# THE CREATION OF STABLE TEXTS

* The texts recited at the First Council must have existed in some form before that event.
* An episode in the Canon suggests early collection of poems (A¢¢hakavagga) possibly during Buddha's lifetime.
* The large body of sermons was divided into four collections, with monks and nuns specializing in memorizing one.

#  The oral tradition and its preservation

* Buddhists likely adopted a similar system to brahmins who orally preserved Vedic texts for centuries.
* Both traditions relied heavily on memorization even after writing was invented.
* Modern scholars have found surprisingly few variants in orally transmitted Vedic texts, suggesting careful preservation.
* Alexander Wynne argues that improvisation played little role in the formation of early Buddhist texts, with emphasis on verbatim transmission.

# The Buddha's First Sermon as an example


* The sermon, known as 'Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Teaching', was delivered to five disciples who became the first monks.
* It likely blended memory with what Buddha "should" have said based on his Enlightenment experience.
* The sermon introduces key concepts like the Middle Way and the Noble Eightfold Path but lacks detailed explanations.
* K. R. Norman argues that each Noble Truth is merely introduced by title, implying prior familiarity among the audience.

## Headings and Summaries

**PERICOPES**
* The Pali Canon is repetitive due to its oral origins and use of pericopes, which are standardized textual passages.
* Pericopes vary in length and were sometimes used inappropriately, indicating varying levels of understanding among the compilers.

**THE COMMENTARIES**
* Commentaries on Buddhist sermons and the Vinaya are attributed to Buddhaghosa (5th century AD), but likely draw from earlier Sinhala commentaries.
* These commentaries claim a lineage back to the Buddha himself, spanning eight centuries, though this doesn't mean they remained unchanged.

**SHORTCOMINGS OF THE COMMENTARIES**
* The commentaries homogenize and systematize the Buddha's message, reflecting brahminical influence ("sanskritization").
* They exhibit excessive literalism, sometimes ascribing technical significance to ordinary expressions.
* They largely lack awareness of the Buddha's historical context, particularly his engagement with early brahminical scriptures.

**DISCREPANCIES**
* Students of the Pali Canon should critically analyze discrepancies within texts.
* Obsucurities or difficulties may indicate later additions or editorial smoothing over of original complexities.
* Comparing different versions of texts can help determine relative chronology, though absolute dating remains challenging.

# This Chapter Is About How The Buddha Reacted To Vedic Ideas And Practices Concerning Fire, And How This Focus May Have Led Him To What Is Perhaps His Most Important Philosophical Idea, The Substitution Of Non-Random Processes For Objects. It Will Provide More Examples Of How The Buddha Reused Brahminical Religious Terms, Turning Them To His Own Purposes.

* The chapter explores the Buddha's engagement with Vedic concepts of fire and how this influenced his philosophy.
* It argues that the focus on fire led the Buddha to a key idea: replacing objects with non-random processes.
* The chapter provides further examples of the Buddha repurposing Brahmanical religious terms for his own teachings.

# FIRE AS THE CENTRAL METAPHOR IN THE
BUDDHAíS SOTERIOLOGY

* Fire serves as a central metaphor in the Buddha's soteriology (the study of salvation). 




## Everything Is Burning 111 ❧ Chapter 8

* The Buddha's "Fire Sermon" uses fire as a metaphor for suffering and its causes.
* All our faculties, their objects, operations, and resulting feelings are said to be on fire with the fires of passion, hatred, and delusion.
* Nirvana, the Buddhist goal, is likened to extinguishing these fires.

## The Meaning of Nirvana

* The word *nirvāṇa* comes from the Sanskrit root *vå*, meaning "to blow," and implies ceasing to burn or going out.
* In Vedic culture, brahmins tended three sacrificial fires symbolizing family life.
* The Buddha reinterpreted these fires as representing passion, hatred, and delusion.

## Positive and Negative Connotations of Fire

* While the Buddha often uses fire negatively in relation to suffering, he also associates it positively with bliss (*nibbuti*) and enlightenment.
* In the "Fire Sermon" narrative, the Buddha outshines brahmin fire-worshippers by producing a bigger and better fire, demonstrating his mastery over this element.

## The Five *Khandha* as Blazing Masses of Fuel

* The five *khandha* (form, feeling, perception, volition, consciousness) are the components of all experience.
* The term *upādāna-khandha*, usually translated as "aggregates of grasping," refers to these components as blazing masses of fuel that sustain the fires of suffering.

##  Nirvana and the Cessation of Fuel

* There are two types of nirvana: *sa-upādī-sesa* (with a residue of fuel) and *an-upādī-sesa* (without a residue of fuel).
* Attaining nirvana during life (*sa-upādī-sesa*) means extinguishing the fires of suffering while still having the potential for experience.

## Fire in Vedic Thought

* Vedic religion centers on fire worship, viewing it as a sacred force essential for life.
* Fire is personified as a god and equated with the sun, symbolizing light, warmth, and the divine.

# Fire and Consciousness

* Fire represents consciousness in the *Rg Veda*.
* This representation is not purely metaphorical but reflects a belief that consciousness has a fiery nature.

# Agni and Cognition

* Agni, the Vedic fire god, is closely linked to mental activity.
* The *Savitri* verse invokes Agni to stimulate thoughts.
* Agni is seen as purifying worshippers through their prayers.

# Agni as Subject and Object

* Agni can represent both the subject and object of cognition.
* This duality is illustrated in passages where Agni is both the source and target of vision.
* The concept of Agni as both subject and object parallels the *atman* in yogic thought.

# The Appetitive Nature of Consciousness

* The cosmogonic myth in *Shatapatha Brahmana* portrays Agni as an eater, highlighting the appetitive nature of consciousness.
* Prajapati creates milk for Agni to consume, symbolizing the sustenance needed for consciousness.
* This myth emphasizes the interconnectedness of food, eater, and consciousness.

## Discussion Of The Nature Of Consciousness, Which Is Compared To

* **The Buddha's Analogy of Consciousness and Fire:**
    * The *Mahå Taƒhå-Sa∆khaya Sutta* uses the analogy of fire to explain consciousness.
    * Just as fire is classified by its fuel, consciousness is classified by what causes it (e.g., eye consciousness arises from seeing).
    * This contrasts with the Upani¶adic view of consciousness as inherent in the world spirit (*brahman*) and individual soul (*åtman*).

* **Consciousness as a Process:**
    * The Buddha argues against the idea of an eternal soul or essence that transmigrates.
    * He emphasizes that consciousness is a process, causally conditioned by sense experiences and mental activity.

* **The Four Foods:**
    * The text mentions four "foods" that sustain beings: normal food, contact, intention, and consciousness.
    * These foods are said to arise from thirst, which in turn arises from feeling, contact, and the six senses.
    * This passage connects to the concept of dependent origination, leading to the destruction of ignorance and suffering.

* **Consciousness as Appetitive:**
    * The Buddha compares consciousness to fire in its appetitive nature, seeking out objects.
    * This suggests that consciousness is not passive but actively engages with the world.

* **Ethical Implications:**
    * While Vedic thought sees consciousness and fire as having an inherent will, Buddhism separates volition (intention) from consciousness.
    * Volition is seen as the ethical element that determines whether an action is good or bad.
    * This reflects the Buddha's focus on ethicizing experience and understanding the causes of suffering.




## THE FIVE KHANDHA ARE PROCESSES

* The five *khandha* and the "Fire Sermon" both categorize sense perception objects and senses as being on fire with passion, hatred, and delusion.
* Both suggest that these things cease to exist when they are no longer "on fire."
*  The five *khandha* are sets of processes fueled by grasping, appetite, thirst, desire, etc., which perpetuate our existence in *sa√såra*.

## A BUDDHIST ANALOGY WITH FIRE

* The Buddha used the metaphor of fire to illustrate several key concepts:
    * Consciousness is like fire in being appetitive and capable of extinguishing itself without external intervention.
    * Fire cannot be separated from what it burns, just as consciousness requires an object. This implies that subject and object are interdependent.
    * Experience consists of processes, not things.

## ETHICIZING VEDIC THOUGHT

* The Buddha transformed Vedic thought by placing lived experience within an ethical framework.
* He aimed to extinguish the "fires" of passion, hatred, and delusion, which were fueled by egotism and belief in a fixed self.

## TWO VIEWS ON LIBERATION

* One view suggests that liberation requires eliminating consciousness, as implied by the "Fire Sermon."
* The other view, proposed by the Buddha, emphasizes purifying consciousness and character through ethical action.

## AN ANALOGY WITH PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY

* The Buddha's concept of processes resembles Heraclitus' philosophy of constant flux ("Everything flows").
* Both thinkers saw fire as a fundamental element representing change.




# Not Have Been Understood By Later Followers To Be The Buddhaís

* This section discusses the idea of "dependent origination" as a key concept in Buddhism. 
* It argues that this concept, while central to Buddhist thought, is complex and has been interpreted in various ways throughout history.

# DEPENDENT ORIGINATION

* Explains the Buddhist concept of "dependent origination," which emphasizes the interconnectedness and causal nature of all phenomena.
* The Chain of Dependent Origination, a twelve-link chain outlining the process from ignorance to suffering and death, is introduced as a key expression of this concept.
* It highlights the difficulty in fully understanding the Chain of Dependent Origination, even for early Buddhists.

# JUREWICZíS DISCOVERY

* Presents Joanna Jurewicz's argument that the Chain of Dependent Origination was formulated as a response to Vedic cosmogony and brahminical thought.
* Explains how the Buddha's teachings often addressed existing beliefs and philosophies, with dependent origination being a prime example.
* Contrasts the Vedic view of a universe grounded in primordial consciousness with the Buddhist focus on the individual experience.

# The Vedic Cosmogony and Dependent Origination

* The Buddha used abstract terminology in the Chain of Dependent Origination, unlike his usual use of metaphors.
* The Pali word *nidåna*, meaning foundation, origin, or cause, is central to understanding the Chain.
* Jurewicz connects *nidåna* to the Vedic concept of an ontological connection between different levels and forms of beings.

# Ignorance and Volitional Impulses

* The Vedic hymn *°Rg Veda* X, 129 describes a primordial state of nothingness, both in terms of existence and non-existence.
* This corresponds to ignorance in the Buddha's chain, as there was no possibility of discerning existence or consciousness.
* The Vedic hymn attributes creation to a volitional impulse called *kåma*, which is akin to desire.

# From Desire to Consciousness

* Jurewicz explores how the Vedic texts depict desire giving rise to consciousness.
* In *BÅU* 1.4, the Creator (*åtman*) realizes his singularity and cognizes himself, representing non-dual consciousness.
* The Buddha's concept of consciousness differs from the Vedic view by emphasizing consciousness of something rather than pure reflexive awareness.

# Name and Form

* Jurewicz highlights the significance of *nåmarµupa*, which in Vedic thought signifies the final formation of the Creator's *åtman*.
* Giving name and form marks the Creator entering his creation, recognizing his identity with it.
* The Buddha appropriates this term to denote an organism where consciousness resides, contrasting with the Vedic concept of self-creation.

#  The End of the Chain and its Implications

* The remaining links in the chain are straightforward and lead to decay, death, grief, and lamentation.
* For Vedic thought, the *åtman*, the self of every being, generates the world through self-cognition.
* Jurewicz suggests that the Buddha's presentation of Dependent Origination effectively negates the Vedic cosmogony by removing the concept of *åtman*.

# The Significance of Jurewicz's Discovery

* Jurewicz's interpretation sheds light on the Buddha's engagement with Vedic thought.
* It reveals a deliberate refutation of Vedic concepts like *åtman* and self-creation.
* The discovery highlights the importance of understanding the historical context of Buddhist teachings.

## Himself How Suffering Arose. How Can That Be True And Jurewiczís Theory Also Be Valid?Í

* Frauwallner argued that the twelve-linked chain is a composite of two lists, originally ending with thirst as the cause of suffering.
* This aligns with texts like SN II, 84ñ5, which express the Second Noble Truth in terms of thirst as the origin of suffering.
* Combining this with Jurewicz's interpretation resolves difficulties regarding the chain's structure and meaning.

## Avijjå The word for ignorance in Sanskrit is *avidyå*.

*  The Pali form, *avijjå*, stands at the beginning of the Chain of Dependent Origination.
* It suggests an identity between existing and being cognized due to its ambiguity, potentially meaning both ignorance and non-existence.

## Sa√khårå

* This term is notoriously difficult to translate, referring to a process or the result of that process.
* The Buddha likely used it to refer primarily to his body as a constructed entity, emphasizing impermanence.
* However, *sa√khåra* can also encompass everything in our experience, highlighting the impermanent nature of all phenomena except nirvana.

## Failure To Understand The Chain Of Dependent Origination

* This failure may stem from neglecting its historical context and focusing on scholastic interpretations rather than its original meaning.
* Some interpretations wrongly apply it to the macrocosm, while others complicate it with concepts like three lives.

## Causality In Buddhism

* While common sense causation is vertical (cause preceding effect), some Buddhist schools propose lateral causation where phenomena influence each other simultaneously or even across time.
* This interpretation is absent in the Pali Canon, which emphasizes that all experiences except Enlightenment are causally conditioned but not necessarily mutually influential.


## We Have Seen In Chapter 5 That The Vedic Tradition Blended (From Our Perspective: Confused) Ontology, The Question Of What Exists, With Epistemology, The Question Of What We Can Know, And How. We Have Also Seen There And In Chapter 8 That The Buddha Argued Against Positing A Category Of Ëbeingí, And Altogether Substituted For The Question Ëwhat Exists?Í The Question Ëwhat Can We Experience?Í

*  COGNITION1





## 144 What The Buddha Thought ❧ Chapter 10 Cognition; Language; Nirvana

* Cognition for the Buddha begins with the six faculties (five senses plus mind) interacting with their respective objects.
* While cognition relies on sense organs, it is not considered empiricism due to the inclusion of the mind as a faculty.
* The Buddha emphasizes guarding the senses due to their potential to cause desire and suffering.

* Cognition involves five sets of processes (*khandhas*): *rµupa* (sense objects), *vi¤¤åƒa* (consciousness), sensation, volitions, and *sa¤¤å* (apperception).
* *Sa¤¤å*, the identification and naming of perceived objects, is where language enters cognition.

* The Buddha saw a problem with the operation of senses leading to both moral and intellectual misguidance.
* This view stems from the idea that our cognitive apparatus shapes our experience, making it inherently subjective.

* The Buddha rejected the Vedic fusion of language and reality, where words were seen as inherent and unchanging representations of things.
* He prohibited the use of archaic Sanskrit (*chandas*) in favor of accessible local dialects, demonstrating his Skill in Means.

* The Buddha's rejection of *chandas* reflected a deeper theoretical issue: he rejected the brahmin notion of fixed word-meaning correspondences.
* For the Buddha, language is conventional and cannot fully capture the fluidity of reality.

* All apperceptions are considered empty (*su¤¤a*), meaning they are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and lack an unchanging essence.
* This concept applies to both the act of apperception and what is being perceived, highlighting the inherent limitations of language in representing reality.
* Nirvana is presented as the exception to this rule, being unaffected by these characteristics.

* The Buddha concluded that language, while necessary for cognition, imposes artificial categories on experience, ultimately undermining the possibility of certified knowledge.

## CATAPHATIC AND APOPHATIC

* The Buddha's view on conceptualization involved inaccuracy due to *papa¤ca*, a term difficult to translate and referring to verbal differentiation or proliferation.
* This inaccuracy stems from language's limitations in representing reality fully.
* Major religions recognize the distinction between cataphatic (positive) and apophatic (negative) expression of the divine.

## PRACTICAl LIMITATIONS OF THE APOPHATIC APPROACH

* The Buddha's teachings exhibit tension between his statements about having no views and those referring to "right views."
* This tension reflects different aspects of his experience: apophatic understanding of ultimate reality beyond language and cataphatic articulation of essential truths like karma.
* The Buddha refused to answer certain questions deemed irrelevant to Enlightenment, highlighting his pragmatism and the limitations of language in expressing certain truths.

* The later doctrine of two truths arose from analyzing phenomena according to the Buddha's insights, leading to a reductionist interpretation.
* This distinction between conventional and ultimate truth reflects the inadequacy of language in fully capturing reality.

## What is Nirvana?

* Nirvana is defined by being the precise opposite of everything in our normal experience.
* It is the one thing that is not composed but exists in its own right.
* Nirvana does not arise from causes and therefore is not covered by the law of causality.

## Rahula's Lack of Clarity

* The author criticizes Ven. Dr Walpola Rahula for his unclear account of nirvana.
* Rahula claims that nirvana is neither cause nor effect, but the author argues that this distinction is confusing.
* The author distinguishes between the experience of realizing something and the thing realized, arguing that while the realization process may be causal, the thing realized is not.

## Truth Is

* The author criticizes Rahula's statement "Truth is" as falling into Upaniadic mode, which confuses truth with reality.
* Nirvana cannot be equated with truth because nirvana is not a proposition.
* The author uses Charles Malamoud's formulation to highlight the ambiguity of salvific gnosis, where the act of realizing something might seem identical to the content realized.

## Experiencing Nirvana

* The author distinguishes between having an experience and having had it.
* Enlightened individuals can describe what it feels like to have attained nirvana, but not what it feels like to attain it.
* The moment of attaining nirvana is ineffable, but those who have experienced it can describe what it feels like afterwards.

## Nirvana as Enlightenment and Death

* The term "nirvana" refers to both enlightenment and the death of an enlightened person.
* Since there are no reports from enlightened people describing their deaths, the apophatic tradition prevails in this context.

## Nagarjuna's Paradox

* Nagarjuna stated that there is no difference between samsara and nirvana, which the author interprets as meaning they are complementary concepts.
* The author argues that understanding what nirvana is not is crucial for comprehending what it is.

## The Middle Way

* The Buddha taught a middle way between being and non-being, which refers to Dependent Origination.
* This concept emphasizes that everything in our experience is process and causally conditioned.
* Misinterpreting this teaching has led to the belief that Buddhism flouts logic.





# Sa∆Gha Were The Nurses Whose Calling It Was To Administer That

* Though there's no canonical evidence, scholars argue the Four Noble Truths follow a medical idiom of diagnosis, cause, cure, and treatment.
* The Buddha saw himself as removing the "arrow" of craving, making his teaching prescriptive.
* *Dharma* in brahminical tradition means both what is and should be; similarly, Pali *dhamma* describes reality and prescribes seeing it that way.

# WAS THE BUDDHA OMNISCIENT?

* The Buddha denied having complete knowledge at all times but claimed threefold knowledge: recollection of past lives, seeing rebirth according to karma, and liberation from corruptions.
* Buddhist tradition interprets this as potential access to all knowable things, not simultaneous omniscience.
* Some texts suggest the Buddha had extraordinary powers beyond human norms, while others portray him more pragmatically.

# The Buddha's Attitude To Philosophy

* The Buddha was primarily concerned with guiding actions towards nirvana, not presenting a philosophically coherent doctrine.
* He used Skill in Means to adapt his language to his audience, favoring analogies and common sense over abstract arguments.
* His style contrasts sharply with the declaratory tone of Vedic literature and the authoritarian tone of later Mahayana sutras.

# Let Us Look At Ways In Which The Buddha Approached His Own Teaching Activity Ñ I Suppose One Could Call Them Meta-Teachings.

* The Buddha emphasized testing his teachings through personal experience rather than blind faith.
* He prioritized truth and benefit over pleasantness when speaking, even if it meant being disagreeable.
* He condemned theorizing without practical value and focused on analyzing how we experience the world (cognitive psychology).
* He discouraged dwelling on unanswerable metaphysical questions that don't lead to liberation.

# The Buddha’s Pragmatism in Relation to Ethics, Meditation and the Monastic Rules

* The Buddha's karma doctrine promoted universal values and principles with practical implications for an increasingly impersonal world.
* His ethics emphasized diligence, mindfulness, and intelligence as key virtues for both worldly and spiritual success.
* He rarely addressed complex ethical dilemmas, focusing on practical solutions within specific contexts.
*  Meditation was seen as a training of the mind ("bhåvanå") with two main aspects: concentration and insight.

# Mental Training in Early Buddhism

* The Buddha's teachings on mental training emphasized "calming" (samatha) and "insight" (vipassana). 
* While "calming" was seen as a preparation for "insight," some later traditions argued that insight could be achieved without it.
* Earlier, the focus was on "awareness" (sati) and "concentration" (samadhi), which were considered crucial components of the Noble Eightfold Path.

# The Social Context of Early Buddhism

* Early Buddhism existed in a pre-literate society with limited formal education.
* Most people learned skills through apprenticeship, while brahmins memorized sacred texts.
* The Buddha's teachings aimed to reach all social classes and genders.
* Modern interpretations might overemphasize the complexity of "awareness" and "concentration," as these concepts were likely more commonplace in that era.

# Cultivating Imagination and Reason

* The Buddha encouraged the use of imagination in meditation exercises, such as visualizing the body's components or contemplating decomposition.
* He also emphasized the importance of reason, believing that proper reasoning would lead individuals to the same conclusions he reached.
* These practices were seen as essential for enhancing thinking abilities.

# The Pragmatism of the Vinaya

* The *Vinaya*, a collection of monastic rules, is attributed to the Buddha due to its logical structure and effectiveness in maintaining the Sangha (monastic community).
* The Buddha's rules were driven by pragmatism, aiming to increase the number of believers and ensure the well-being of both monks and lay people.

# Formation and Evolution of the Vinaya

* The *Vinaya* evolved through a process of "conjecture and refutation," addressing specific situations and unintended consequences of previous rulings.
* This approach resembles trial and error, demonstrating a commitment to adapting rules based on experience.
* While some minor rules may have been added after the Buddha's time, they followed the established pattern of responding to practical needs.

# The Case of Novice Ordination

* The establishment of novice ordination (samaṇera) illustrates the Buddha's pragmatic approach to rule-making.
* A group of boys under twenty were ordained, causing disruption due to their immaturity.
* This led the Buddha to establish a rule prohibiting the ordination of those under twenty, demonstrating his concern for both monastic discipline and public perception.



## # The Representation Of Brahmins

*  The text discusses how the *Vinaya* portrays Brahmins. 
* It suggests that Brahmin terms are used as social metaphors in Buddhist texts.




## 180 What The Buddha Thought ❧ Chapter 12

* Buddhist literature often portrays brahmins negatively.
* The *Vessantara Jåtaka*, a popular story, depicts a brahmin named Jµujaka who makes an outrageous request for the future Buddha's children due to lust and greed.
* While not all depictions are negative, the actual practice of brahminism is criticized in Buddhist texts, particularly animal sacrifice.

## SATIRES OF BRAHMIN SACRED TEXTS

* The *Brahmajåla Sutta* satirizes brahmin beliefs by presenting a story where Brahmå mistakenly believes he created other beings simply because they appeared after him.
* This satirical portrayal highlights the Buddha's critique of brahminical claims to ultimate knowledge and authority.
* The story also appears in the *Bæhad-åraƒyaka Upani¶ad*, demonstrating a shared theme across different traditions.

# SATIRIZING THE BRAHMINS
* The Buddha parodies Vedic creation myths in the *Agga¤¤a Sutta*.
* He challenges brahminical claims of purity and superiority by highlighting their shared humanity with others.
* The Buddha uses wordplay and humor to subvert traditional notions of caste and social hierarchy.

# SATIRIZING THE JAINS




# The Buddhaís Environment That It Was Natural To Use The Term

* Brahmins and their claim to hierarchical superiority were prominent features of the Buddha's environment.
* This made it natural for him to use the term "brahmin" metaphorically.

# EXTENDED ñ EVEN PLAYFUL ñ USE OF ëBRAHMINí EXTENDED ñ EVEN PLAYFUL ñ USE OF ëBRAHMINí AS A METAPHOR

* Not all of the Buddha's references to brahmins are negative or satirical.
* He used "brahmin" metaphorically, similar to how we use "jumbo" for large hamburgers.
* An example is a *sutta* where he describes three types of "high and big beds": divine, brahmic, and noble.

# IS THIS BOOK TO BE BELIEVED? 193

* This book started as a set of lectures.
* The author was completing the lectures when a colleague posted on Indology Net.





# Am A Member, The Question Whether Anything Had Recently Been

published which showed whether the Buddha or the Bæhad-åraƒyaka Upani¶ad came first.

*  The author posted a list of publications concerning passages in the Pali Canon where the Buddha refers to surviving passages in the *Upani¶ad*s, mostly in the BÅU.
* The author argues that unless we believe the Buddha was omniscient, his references to important passages in the BÅU must mean they existed when he preached.
* A professor of Buddhism responded by saying that while the Buddha may refer to Upanisadic passages, literary works mentioning "the Buddha" exist up to at least the 15th century AD.

* This suggests the Pali sources, which tend to center around the literary conceit of Gotama preaching, are no older than the pre-4th century, possibly redacted around the 1st century BC, with parts dating back a few centuries earlier.
* There is no solid evidence linking them to Gotama (the historical Buddha).

* The professor argues that claiming the Upanisads must date from before Gotama preached merely because they are alluded to in Pali sources is outrunning the evidence.


# KARMA IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT

* The author aims to show that the Buddha's main ideas are powerful and coherent, arguing against the view that Buddhism is a movement whose origins are unknown.
* The author believes the Buddha established individual responsibility through his theory of karma, contrasting it with the Jain philosophy which was philosophically crude.
* The Buddha's theory of karma substituted ethics for ritual, making intention the final criterion for judging ethical value.

* This was a great step forward in civilization because it meant that all human beings are equal on the ethical plane.
* The Buddha also claimed we are masters of our own destinies, responsible for our fates, which was unusual for his time.


# NON-RANDOM PROCESS

* The author emphasizes the importance of karma as a process, highlighting its indeterminate nature due to free will but arguing it cannot be random.
* The author draws parallels between the Buddha's concept of karma and Vedic speculation about fire, seeing both as non-random processes that operate without an agent.
* This inspired the Buddha to reinterpret objects as processes, constantly changing and not stable entities.

* Language, with its fixed names for perceived objects, is seen as a barrier to understanding this truth.
* The Buddha's experience of breaking through this "veil of language" led him to confront reality beyond words, impermanence, and suffering.


# DEVELOPMENTS TOWARDS AND IN THE MAHAYANA

* The author acknowledges that some Buddhists may find surprises in the book due to its unconventional approach.
* The author suggests approaching this topic from the perspective of karma, highlighting the rigor of the doctrine of responsibility for one's fate.

## Sustain Even Within The Pali/Theravada Tradition, And That It Was

*  The doctrine of karma is central to Buddhism but has varied in emphasis across traditions.
*  Buddhists generally believe salvation comes from within ("own power") but also seek help from external forces like Buddhas and bodhisattvas ("other power").

## Mahāyāna: The Great Path

*  Mahāyāna Buddhism emphasizes the bodhisattva path, where individuals strive for enlightenment to benefit all beings.
*  The concept of transferring merit is key to the bodhisattva ideal.
*  Mahāyāna differs from earlier Buddhism by applying the concept of "no self" to all entities and placing greater emphasis on altruism.

## Buddhist Devotion: An Unintended Consequence?

* The Buddha discouraged reliance on leaders and encouraged independent thinking, but his followers developed devotional practices.
* Despite the Buddha's rejection of ritual, Buddhist rites and liturgies emerged.
* The author suggests that the Buddha's portrayal as godlike began during his lifetime, despite his teachings against such veneration.

## Be Like The Kālāmas: Find Out For Yourself

*  The author encourages readers to critically examine his interpretations by reading the Pali Canon.
* He advocates for learning Pali to gain a deeper understanding of Buddhist texts and their cultural context.
* The author expresses hope that renewed interest in Pali studies will lead to a more informed appreciation of the Buddha's teachings.

## This Book Shows How The Buddha Both Borrowed And Twisted Brahminical Terminology. Five Cases Which Seem To Me Important But Not Central I Have Here Segregated In An Appendix So That Readers Who Find My Discussions Too Technical Can Lighten Their Load By Skipping Them.

*  The author highlights the Buddha's adaptation and reinterpretation of Brahminical terms, providing five specific examples in an appendix for interested readers.

## 202 What The Buddha Thought ❧ Appendix The Buddhaís Appropriation Of Four (Or Five?) Brahminical Terms

* **Brahmacariya**
    * This term literally means "brahma-conduct".
    * It was a brahminical term for the first stage of a high-caste boy's life, involving study of the Vedas and chastity.
    * The Buddha used it in a wider sense to refer to the holy life of any member of the Sa∆gha.
    * He also sometimes used it to refer to nirvana.

* **Samkappa** 
    * This term means "right resolve" or "right intention".
    * It is the second step on the Noble Eightfold Path.
    * In brahminical ritual, a statement of intent was made before performing a ritual.
    * The Buddha substituted ethics for ritual, so right intention became essential for ethical behavior.

* **Ekodi-bhava**
    * This term refers to one-pointedness of thought in the second jhana meditative state.
    * It may be derived from the Sanskrit "ekoti", meaning "one".
    * The Buddha may have borrowed this term from Vedanta, where it refers to a sense of unity.

* **Puthujjana**
    * This term refers to people who have not yet become stream-enterers on the path to Enlightenment.
    * It may be derived from "paþu", meaning "many" or "separated".
    * The Buddha may have borrowed this term to contrast with a sense of oneness.

* **Papa¤ca**
    * This term means "quintuplication".
    * It may be related to the five kinds of breath mentioned in the *Bæhad-åraƒyaka Upani¶ad*.
    * The Buddha may have appropriated this term to highlight the illusion of multiplicity.

* For more on this semantic problem, see my 'Understanding early Buddhist terminology in its context', pp. 74–101.

# The Pali Canon

* In Pali it is called the Tipitaka , which literally means 'that which consists of three baskets'.
* In the Bhabra edict, the inscription in which he exhorts his subjects to learn certain named Buddhist texts, the emperor Asoka refers to the texts as dhamma-paliyāya, i.e., pariyāya.
* This early terminology corresponds rather closely to the later distinction in Sanskrit between sūtra and śūstra , though the latter pair of terms refers to genres of text.
* Perhaps I should add that in the Mahayana the term refers particularly to earlier non-Mahayana teachings, which are thus claimed to fall short of the full truth.

# Karma and Nirvana

* T. W. Rhys Davids, 'Introduction to the Kassapa-Sīhanāda Sutta,' Dialogues of the Buddha, Part 1, pp. 206–7. I quote the whole passage in How Buddhism Began , pp. 17–18.
* Karma and nirvana are the two Buddhist doctrinal terms which I assume to have become naturalized in English and are therefore not italicized.

# Impermanence

* AN III, 415.
* The term 'impermanent' does not, of course, necessarily imply that something is changing all the time, and I believe that in some contexts the Buddha did not intend the term to carry this strong sense. But expositions gloss this over; and in the abhidharma the doctrine was systematized to mean constant change: it was even attempted to specify the speed of change.

# Buddhist Stories

* In the Theravada/Pali tradition, these stories are conventionally said to number 550. Some of them are found in all major Buddhist traditions.
* p. 40.
* P: sīla-bbata-parāmāso.

# Theravada Buddhism: A Social History

* Most of the last four paragraphs is taken from my Theravada Buddhism: A
Social History, pp. 69–70.

# Kusala

* AN I, 188-93.
* Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism , pp. 83–8. This is of course not to deny that the Buddha's ideas can be, have been, and should be applied to politics and public affairs.
* In Sanskrit the word is kusala.
* See L. S. Cousins, 'Good or skilful? - Kusala in Canon and commentary' (1996), especially pp. 143–8.

# The Pali Canon: Evidence

* Vin. I, 49 para 20, 46 para 10.
* This refers to their being written down for the first time. But our earliest physical evidence, our oldest manuscripts, of most texts is not nearly that old, and each copying brings further errors, including interpolations.
* For a summary account of our evidence for the Pali Canon, see my 'What is Pali?' in A Pali Grammar.
* I have thus accepted the criticism, first I believe made by Dr Sue Hamilton, of my earlier usage; I mention it in How Buddhism Began (2006), p. 37, n. 9.

# Phala and Apadāna

* The normal word is 'fruit' ( phala ). But occasionally the same thing is referred to as a 'harvest' (P: apadāna , literally 'reaping'). This latter word was Sanskritized as avadāna and its original meaning then forgotten.
* But like the Pali work entitled Apadāna , an avadāna was originally a story of how a deed in a former life bore fruit in the present.

# DN I, 53–4

* DN I, 53–4.

# SN IV, 230–1 = sutta xxxvi, 21.1

* SN IV, 230–1 = sutta xxxvi, 21.1. The same list at AN II, 87.

# Parihāra

* This is because the commentary ( Sārattha-ppakāsinī , III, 81–82) instances being run over by a truck, being bitten by a snake and falling into a pit.
* In this I am following the same entry in PED , s.v. parihāra , but choosing the first meaning given: 'attention, care'; the list of examples begins with gabbha-parihāra , 'care of the foetus'.

# Opakkamika

* Thus Margaret Cone, A Dictionary of Pāli: Part I (2001), s.v. opakkamika.
* Peter Harvey has kindly pointed out to me (personal communication) that, at MN II, 218, the Buddha asks some Jains about their ascetic practices; Ñāṇamoli and Bodhi translate: 'When there is intense exertion ( tippo upakkamo ), intense striving, do you then feel intense, painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense exertion ( tippā tamhi samaye opakkamikā dukkhā tippā kaṭukā vedanā vedaniyatha )?' This would be an act of violence perpetrated on oneself in rigorous asceticism. The commentary (see n. 5 above) says that the reference is to being beaten up on the grounds that one is a thief or adulterer; though this is ludicrously over-specific, it is plausible inasmuch as it refers to an act of violence perpetrated on one by others.

# AN II, 80

* Richard Gombrich, Precept and Practice (1971), p. 150.
* AN II, 80. The other three are the scope of a Buddha, the scope of a meditator and the world. The sutta gives no further explanation, so what is meant in these other cases is obscure.

# DN I, 82–3

* DN I, 82–3.
* There is a great deal of information in Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett, The Sociology of Early Buddhism (2003), though I disagree with their interpretation of how it relates to the rise of Buddhism.
* D. D. Kosambi, The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline (1965), pp. 100–1. Recent work on the Buddha's date - on which most other dating depends - means that for 'sixth century' we should now read 'fifth'.

# Jāta-vedas

* The word pity , 'father', is used in the plural to refer to patrilineal ancestors.
* Jāta-vedas is a name of Agni, fire personified [RFG].

# Harmless Souls

* W. J. Johnson, Harmless Souls (1995), pp. 23–4.

# MN III, 71–2

* E.g., MN III, 71–2. Here the Buddha characterizes this as the lower of two forms of right view, meritorious ( puñña-bhāgiya ) but still corrupted
( sāsava ) and thus to be transcended by supramundane ( lokuttarā ) right view. On this, Bhikkhu Bodhi, guided by the commentary, comments: 'We may understand that the conceptual comprehension of the four truths falls under mundane right view, while the direct penetration of the truths by realising Nibbāna with the path constitutes supramundane right view' ( The Middle Length Discourses, pp. 1327–8, n. 1103). Thus the factual content of the two forms of right view is the same, but one understands it by different means. This subtlety smacks to me of the ahidhamma.

# BAU 4.3.7–9

* BAU 4.3.7–9. The translations I give from the Upaniṣad s are mostly those of Patrick Olivelle in The Early Upaniṣads , except that I have anglicized the spelling.
* The ambiguity of this sentence will be explored below.

# History of Indian Philosophy

* Erich Frauwallner, History of Indian Philosophy (1973), pp. 36–61. Alas, the translation is seriously inaccurate, so anyone who can should use the original German work, Geschichte der indischen Philosophie (1953).

# BAU 1.4.10

* BAU 1.4.10. Later tradition took tat tvam asi , 'thou art that' ( Ch. Up.
6.8.7–6.16.3) to mean the same thing, but modern scholarship has cast serious doubt on that interpretation. See Joel Brereton, '"Tat Tvam Asi" in context' (1986).

# God both transcends the world and is immanent in it

* That God both transcends the world and is immanent in it is an idea familiar to Christian theologians.

# BAU 6.2.15

* BAU 6.2.15.
* Ch.Up. 5.10.1: śraddhā tapa ity upāsate. This is obscure: 'who reverently understand faith to be austerity'? 'who reverently understand austerity to be faith'?

# Observations on the sect of Jains

* In his 'Observations on the sect of Jains' (1807) Henry Thomas Colebrooke was the first modern scholar clearly to distinguish Jainism from Buddhism, but he thought Buddhism to be the older.

Caillat does not relate this to the question of preserving the tradition; I owe this idea to a conversation with Will Johnson.

# Plants and seeds capable of germination are sentient beings

* I should make it clear that this general idea was quite widespread.
As for Vedic religion, there is sufficient evidence that not only animals but also plants as well as seeds and even water and earth were … believed to be living and even sentient, and fire and wind had at least a personalized, divine aspect … Even in post- Vedic Hinduism, at least the view that plants and seeds capable of germination are sentient beings is still well documented, although some … disagree.
