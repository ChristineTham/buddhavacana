# A Distant Mirror: Studying Indian Buddhism through Chinese Sources

* The title "A Distant Mirror" refers to Barbara Tuchman's work on 14th-century Europe, but is used here in a more proximate sense.
* It suggests that features of the Chinese Buddhist tradition can serve as a "distant mirror," reflecting aspects common to Buddhism in India and beyond.

* The studies in this volume explore how Chinese developments might inform us about "genuine" Buddhism rather than being mere distortions of an Indian gold standard.
* This approach contrasts with simplistic views of Chinese Buddhism as simply a product of "sinification."
* The challenge lies in balancing the view of Chinese Buddhism as a "distant mirror" with the concept of "sinification."

* Gregory Schopen's notion of a "Chinese looking-glass" is also considered, acknowledging the possibility that Chinese evidence might present distorted or satirical views of Indian Buddhism.

* However, the studies in this collection aim to correct both the tendency to see Chinese Buddhism as directly reflecting Indian developments and the tendency to view it as entirely unique and parochial.
* They explore the ideas of Chinese authors and thinkers as independent or alternate developments within Buddhist tradition.
* Examples include Chen-kuo Lin's comparison of Jingying Huiyuan and Dignāga, Shinya Moriyama's examination of Xuanzang and Kuiji's theories on fallacies, and Jakub Zamorski's analysis of Chinese syntax in relation to Buddhist logic.

* Yoke Meei Choong demonstrates that Chinese scholiast monks were capable of critical interpretation and skillfully used sources to advance their own doctrinal agendas.





# Hans-Rudolf Kantor's Study

* Focuses on Chinese Buddhist thinkers' contributions to understanding fundamental doctrinal questions.
* Examines the relationship between reality and delusion, awakened and non-awakened mind in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
* Argues that the Mahāyāna "ultimate" is interdependent with the relative/conventional world.
* Suggests that seemingly "sinified" positions may offer genuine insights into Buddhist problematics.

# Zhihua Yao's Study

* Analyzes the Yogācāra understanding of emptiness, contrasting it with Madhyamaka interpretations.
* Considers the difference between Indian Buddhism's apophatic approach and Chinese Buddhism's kataphatic approach.
* Treats Chinese source texts as authentic Indian positions or coherent developments thereof.
* Uses the *Fo-xing lun/*Buddhadhātu-*śāstra* as a central example, despite debates about its authorship.

# Oral Transmission in Chinese Buddhism

* Explores the possibility of oral transmission of Buddhist ideas from India to China.
* Discusses how Xuanzang's disciples might have preserved Dignāga's logic system through oral teachings.
* Highlights Kuiji's knowledge of Dignāga's *apoha* theory, suggesting oral transmission from Xuanzang.

# Diversity and Heterogeneity in Chinese Buddhism

* Aims to capture the complexity of Buddhist thinking in China during the sixth and seventh centuries.
* Uses the reception and transformation of Indian elements as a heuristic tool.
* Avoids simplistic "sinification" paradigms and searches for "origins of schools."
* Emphasizes examining "roads not taken" and close parallels with Indic predecessors.



## Logic And Epistemology

* Funayama Toru analyzes the term *xianliang* (現量), a translation for Sanskrit *pratyakṣa* ("direct perception").
* He argues that Chinese scholar-monks developed distinctive interpretations of *xianliang*, which should be considered from the perspective of the Chinese language.
* These interpretations are not "mistakes" but a new type of development, reflecting the "sinification of Buddhist concepts".

## Jingying Huiyuan's Epistemology

* Chen-kuo Lin examines Jingying Huiyuan's Essay on the Three Means of Valid Cognition (San liang zhi yi 三量智義).
* He argues that Huiyuan sees epistemology as relative to stages of intellectual and spiritual cultivation, unlike Dignāga who sought a universal foundation.
* Huiyuan uses "principle" (li 理) and "phenomenon/phenomena" (shi 事) to develop his theory of *pramāṇa*, reflecting a dialectical interaction between Indian concepts and Chinese thought.

## Kuiji's Understanding of Dignāga's Apoha Theory

* Shoryu Katsura discusses Kuiji's understanding of Dignāga's *apoha* theory, based on Kuiji's commentary on the Cheng weishi lun *shuji*.
* Kuiji defines general characteristic as "exclusion of others" (*zheyu* 遮餘), which is the nature and function of conceptual cognition.
* He suggests that even the general characteristic cannot ultimately be expressed verbally, a development not necessarily endorsed by Dignāga.

## Kuiji's Commentary on Nyāyapraveśa

* Shinya Moriyama examines Kuiji's commentary on Śaṅkara-svāmin's *Nyāyapraveśa*, focusing on his interpretation of the antinomic reason (virud*dhāvyabhicārin*).
* While Kuiji understands the background and significance of this category, his interpretation reflects a mix of insight, original thought, and misunderstanding.
* This example shows the complexity of East Asian interpretations of Buddhist ideas.

## Self-Refutation in Chinese Hetuvidyā

* Jakub Zamorski analyzes a chapter in the history of *hetuvidyā*, focusing on fallacious statements and self-refutation.
* He argues that Chinese commentators regarded these statements as examples of "opposition to one's own words" (*svavacanaviruddha*).
* While Chinese authors made original contributions to the issue of self-refutation, their arguments also reveal peculiarities of a "sinified" understanding of *hetuvidyā*. 




## Yogācāra Ideas And Authors

* Ching Keng challenges the assumption that the *Awakening of Faith* was influenced by the Dilun School.
* Keng argues that Huiyuan, a key Dilun master, did not share the *Awakening of Faith*'s blurring of unconditioned and conditioned dharmas.
* He suggests that Huiyuan's thought, representative of Dilun thought, maintained a dualistic scheme with a distinct unconditioned aspect.

## Charles Muller

* Muller provides a translation of Jingying Huiyuan's *Erzhang yi*, focusing on the two hindrances in Buddhism.
* He situates Huiyuan's work within the broader context of Buddhist meditation and its emphasis on psychological aspects of human problems.
* Muller argues that while the concept of two hindrances developed over time, it was significantly shaped by Dilun and Tathāgatagarbha scholars like Huiyuan.

## Junjie Chu

* Chu analyzes a passage in Xuanzang's *Cheng weishi lun* discussing the term *kaidaoyi*.
* He examines the meaning of *kaidao* and yi, tracing their possible origins in Abhidharma and Yogācāra sources.
* Chu argues that *kaidaoyi* refers to the *avakāśadānāśraya*, a concept found in both Abhidharma and Yogācāra traditions.

## Zhihua Yao

* Yao critiques the prevalent Madhyamaka view of reality based on the two truths paradigm, arguing it leads to an illusory worldview.
* He contrasts this with the Yogācāra theory of three natures, which he sees as a more holistic approach.
* Yao analyzes criticisms of the Madhyamaka two truths from Maitreyanātha, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu, advocating for the Yogācāra perspective. 




## Other Indian Ideas

* Hans-Rudolf Kantor discusses how sixth-century Chinese Buddhists used Indian Mahāyāna scriptures to develop constructivist approaches to "mind and consciousness."
* Kantor argues that these texts emphasize the inseparability of truth and falsehood in our understanding of the world.
* He highlights the common epistemological and ontological concerns present in these discussions, despite their differing views on "mind and consciousness."

## Chinese Translations Of Pratyakṣa 1

* Funayama Toru explores the translation of *pratyakṣa* ("direct perception") into Chinese as *xianliang* (現量) by Xuanzang.
* He examines earlier appearances of this term before Xuanzang, noting that it is not a literal translation and its origin is unclear.
* Funayama analyzes post-Xuanzang interpretations of *xianliang*, suggesting possible connections to the "sinification of Buddhism" and unique Chinese understandings of the term. 




## 34 Funayama 1 Xianliang As Translation

###  Prior Usage of *xianliang*

* Before Xuanzang, *xianliang* was already used as a translation for *pratyakṣa* by some translators:
    * Prabhākaramitra (波羅頗蜜 多羅) used it in his translation of Bhāviveka's commentary on the *Middle Treatise*.
    * Members of the Dilun (地論) school, such as Jingying Huiyuan (淨影寺慧遠), also employed the term.

### Xuanzang's Use of *xianliang*

* Xuanzang frequently used *xianliang* to translate *pratyakṣa*, but it wasn't his only choice.
* He sometimes used *xianjian* (現見) as well.
* While Xuanzang preferred literal translations, he adopted *xianliang*, possibly influenced by the Dilun school's preference for the term.

### The Meaning of *xianliang*

* *Liang* (量) literally means "measure," "measurement," or "amount."
* In some contexts, it corresponds to *pramāṇa*.
* Huiyuan used *xianliang* in a broad sense, referring to "measurement" rather than specifically "a means of valid cognition."

###  The Dilun School and *xianliang*

* The Dilun school favored *xianliang*, even though the term wasn't widely used in translations.
* Their preference for *xianliang* is not entirely clear, as the *Huizheng lun*, which uses the term, was not a major text for them.

###  Significance of Xuanzang's Use

* Xuanzang's use of *xianliang* meant he couldn't distinguish between *pratyakṣa* and *pratyakṣaṃ pramāṇam* in his translation.
* This is interesting considering Xuanzang's generally rigorous approach to translation.




# In ending this first section

* The phrase *zixin xian liang* (自心 現量) appears forty times in Guṇabhadra's translation of the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra (*Lengqie jing*).
* *xian liang* is not a single term; *xian* signifies "to appear, manifest itself" and *liang* is a translation of *mātra* "merely, only, nothing but".

# The usage of *xian liang* in the following passage from the Chinese Laṅkāvatāra* is also noteworthy in connection with *pramāṇ*a theory:

*  The passage discusses the concept of Nirvāṇa as understanding what is manifested by one's own mind.
* It mentions four types of measurement (*liang*) : direct perception, inferential understanding, analogy, and transmission from distinguished predecessors.
* The passage criticizes non-Buddhists for not being trustworthy on the topic of these four types of mensuration.
* It describes the state of Nirvāṇa as being free from attachment to external nature, the tetralemma, and delusions manifested by one's own mind.

# There is an interlinear note (shown by the angle brackets: 〈…〉) after zixin xian liang (自心現量)[2].

* This note refers to a fourfold classification of *pramāṇa* (*liang* 量[3]), likely from the Nyāya school.
* The author believes this note is not a later interpolation but a commentary added by the translators themselves.

# This passage corresponds to the following Sanskrit passage, though the two are not entirely identical:

*  The Sanskrit passage also discusses Nirvāṇa and mentions svacittad*ṛśyamātra* which is translated as *zixin xian liang* in Chinese.
* The term *pramāṇ*a is translated as *duliang* (度量) in Chinese, indicating a foil theory of *pramāṇ*a.

# To sum up

* In this passage of the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra*, zixin xian liang* has nothing to do with *pratyakṣa* (direct perception), despite initial appearances due to the misplacement of a note on the fourfold classification of *pramāṇa*.

## 2 The Sinification Of The Concept Of Xianliang

* This section examines how Chinese scholar-monks interpreted the term *xianliang*, a translation of the Sanskrit word *pratyakṣa*.
* The Sanskrit *pratyakṣa* is a compound word meaning "perception" or "the object of perception".
* In Buddhist Pramāṇa school, Dharmottara explains direct perception as "that which depends on - namely is based on - the sense organ".

* The Chinese term *xianliang* is a strange word because it was created artificially for translation and has no pre-Buddhist usage. 
* Both elements of *xianliang*, *xian* and *liang*, have various senses, making its meaning unclear.

* Pre-Xuanzang period interpretations:
    * Jingying Huiyuan (Sui dynasty) gives two meanings to *xianliang*: direct understanding of entities or understanding of present entities.
    * The anonymous author of *She dasheng lun chao* defines *xian* as referring to present entities and *liang* as "mensuration".

* Xuanzang's translations:
    * Xuanzang translated *pratyakṣa* as both *xian* and *xianliang*.
    * This ambiguity opened the way for new interpretations.

* Kuiji's (Tang dynasty) commentary on the Nyāyapraveśa:
    * Explains *xianliang* in terms of fourfold classification of non-conceptual cognition and five kinds of sensory cognition.

* Kuiji's commentary on the Viṃśikā/Viṃśatikā:
    * Presents eight different interpretations of *xianliang* from various Indian schools.
    * Analyzes *xianliang* as a compound word using Sanskrit grammatical terms.
    * Explains *xianliang* as "measure which is based on the actual", with *xian* meaning "sense organ".





# Kuiji's Interpretation

* Kuiji interprets *xianliang* as a compound word consisting of *xian* and *liang*.
* He equates *xian* with *pratyakṣa* (direct perception) and *liang* with *pramāṇa* (valid cognition).
* This interpretation suggests a single compound form like *pratyakṣapramāṇ*a, which is not attested in Sanskrit Buddhist texts.

# Jingyan's Commentary

* Jingyan presents three interpretations of *xianliang*, including one similar to Kuiji's view as a *tatpuruṣa* compound.
* He also proposes an interpretation where *xianliang* is a *karmadhāraya* compound, meaning that *xian* itself is *liang*.

# Tankuang's Analysis

* Tankuang interprets *xianliang* as a *karmadhāraya* compound.
* He defines *xian* as "directly before one's eyes" and *liang* as "mensuration."
* This interpretation emphasizes the clarity and directness of perception.

# Zhixu's Integration with the Laṅkāvatāra-Sūtra

* Zhixu connects *xianliang* to the Mind-Only theory presented in the Laṅkāvatāra-Sūtra.
* He defines *xian* as "directly manifest" and *liang* as "[what the mind can] discern and measure."
* This interpretation suggests that all phenomena are manifestations of the mind and fall within its scope of perception.



## Conclusion

* In the Six Dynasties period, *pratyakṣa* was translated by various words, including *xianliang*, which later became a technical term used by the Dilun school.
* Xuanzang employed *xianliang* as a translation of both *pratyakṣa* and *pratyakṣaṃ pramāṇam*. 
* Chinese scholar-monks after Xuanzang analyzed *xianliang*, dividing it into *xian* and *liang*, and applying their knowledge of Sanskrit compounds to its meaning.

## Epistemology and Cultivation in Jingying Huiyuan's Essay on the Three Means of Valid Cognition

* The paper argues that Chinese textual sources have been ignored in studies of Buddhist epistemology, despite preserving valuable information about this field before Xuanzang.
* It focuses on Jingying Huiyuan's *Essay on the Three Means of Valid Cognition*, arguing that it demonstrates a significant reception of Indian Buddhist epistemology in China before Xuanzang.
* The paper provides a brief historical background of how Buddhist epistemology was introduced to China during the fifth and sixth centuries, including translations by Kumārajīva and other early texts.




## Theological Topics

* Kumārajīva's translation of Qingmu's (*Piṅgala) Commentary on MMK used four *pramāṇa* to argue against the existence of the soul (ātman).
* The commentary argued that since no one has seen a soul, there is no epistemic ground for believing in its existence.

* Later Buddhist logical texts also presented arguments against the existence of a soul and a cosmic creator.

## Metaphysical Topics

* Buddhist philosophical schools debated metaphysical questions like the nature of existents (*dharma*) and whether the world exists independently of mind.
* Sarvāstivāda argued for direct realism, Sautrāntika for indirect realism, Mādhyamika for emptiness, and Yogācāra for idealism.
* These debates were settled through logical argument and epistemological justification.

* Vasubandhu's *Viṃśatik*ā used four *pramāṇa* to argue for idealism (*vijñaptimātra*) against realism.

## Topics On Epistemology And Meditation

* Huiyuan's *San liang zhi yi* (SLZY) focuses on the relationship between epistemology and meditation.
* He emphasized hermeneutic exegesis over logical argumentation and placed importance on the meditational context of epistemology.
* Huiyuan believed that perception and inference are not universal but vary depending on the stage of meditational practice.

* He derived his understanding of Buddhist logic and epistemology from pre-Dignāgan sources.

* Unlike Dignāga who accepted only two means of cognition (perception and inference), Huiyuan included authoritative teaching as a third means.
* Huiyuan believed that each means of cognition is directed at both the particular (shi 事) and the universal (li 理).

## Text, Author, And Context

* The text under study is Huiyuan's Essay on the Three Means of Valid Cognition (SLZY), a chapter in his magnum opus, A Compendium of the Great Vehicle (*Dasheng yizhang* 大乘義章 = DSYZ).
* The genre of DSYZ, that is, Mahāyāna Abhidharma, was not invented by Huiyuan but can be traced back to the writings of Kumārajīva.
* Within the overall structure of DSYZ, SLZY is included under the category of Purified Dharmas.

## Doctrinal Analysis

* In the SLZY, Huiyuan lays out an exposition of the three *pramāṇa*s in the scholastic style. The essay is divided into three sections: (1) "Exposition of terminology", which defines the meaning and usage of the three *pramāṇa*s; (2) "Examination of characteristics", which gives further clarification; and (3) "Analysis in accordance with the ranks of cultivation", where issues of *pram*āṇa are placed in the context of meditative cultivation.
* Huiyuan elucidates the meaning of the pramāṇas, treating pratyakṣa, *anumāna* and ā*ptāgama* respectively. 
* The first means of cognition is named *pratyakṣa*, which is rendered in Chinese by *xian* (現). Huiyuan defines it either as the immediate cognition (*xianzhi* 現知) of existents, or as the cognition of present existents (*xianfa* 現法).
* Huiyuan further analyzes perception into two types: cognition of a particular ("fact", "thing", shi 事), and cognition of a universal ("truth", "principle", li 理). 
* Huiyuan goes on to define another aspect of perception as cognition of li (the universal), claiming that perception of li (the universal) occurs in the realm of desire (*kāma-dhātu*) only, while perception of shi (the particular) can occur in any realm and at any time.
* Huiyuan illustrates the perception of li by citing a passage from the *Abhidharmavibhāṣā* which refers to the stage of *laukikāgra-dharma* (世第一 法) just preceding the entry into the outflow-free darśana-mārga.





# Inference

* Huiyuan defines "inference" as "knowing *dharma*s through analogical reasoning (*pidu* 譬度)".
* Unlike Dignāga, Huiyuan includes both the universal/principle (li) and the particular/thing (shi) as the object of inference.
* Huiyuan explains the inferential cognition of the particular first, claiming that it is the cognition of existents that are known through inference in any realm and any time. 
* Then, he explains the inferential cognition of the universal using different hermeneutical frameworks.

# Authoritative Teaching

* Huiyuan defines "authoritative teaching" as "that by which one knows profound *dharma*s that it is beyond one's own capability to learn".
* He holds fast to the independent value of authoritative teaching handed down from the tradition.
*  By means of this third *pramāṇ*a, one is able to know both li and shi; and once again, li and shi are viewed in the theoretical framework of the Two Truths. 
* Knowledge of shi belongs to the conventional realm while knowledge of li belongs to the trans-conventional realm.



## Concluding Remarks
* Huiyuan systematized Indian Buddhist epistemology (*pramāṇavāda*) using available sources in sixth-century China.
* He categorized Buddhist doctrines according to a Chinese mode of classification (*panjiao*).
* Huiyuan viewed epistemology as relative to stages of spiritual cultivation, unlike Dignāga who saw it as universal.

## The Most Striking Feature of Huiyuan's *pramāṇa* Theory
* Huiyuan incorporated the ontological categories of li and shi ("particular" and "universal") into his epistemological discourse.

## Sinification or Indianization?
* Huiyuan's use of li and shi might suggest Sinification, but he reframes them within an Indian Buddhist context.
* His *panjiao* framework demonstrates Sinification at the hermeneutical level.

## The Relationship Between Li and Shi in Different Schools
* Huiyuan examined the relationship between li and shi in four Buddhist schools: Sarvāstivādins, Sautrāntikas, Mādhyamikas, and Tathāgatagarbha.
* Each school had a different interpretation of their relationship.

## Weaving Sinitic Ontology and Indic Epistemology
* Huiyuan's system potentially demonstrates the possibility of combining Sinitic ontology and Indic epistemology.
* This allows for li and shi to be considered as objects of cognition for perception, inference, and authoritative teaching.

## Appendix: English Translation of Huiyuan's *Essay on the Three Means* of Valid Cognition 
* Provides a translation of Huiyuan's text on valid cognition.

## 第一釋名 1 Exposition Of Terminology

* The meaning of the three means of valid cognition (*pramāṇ*a) comes from the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra.
* There are different theories about the number of means of valid cognition. One theory divides them into three types: (1) perception (*pratyakṣa*), (2) inference (*anumāna*) and (3) scripture (āpt*āgama*).

## 言現量者 2 Perception

* Perception (*pratyakṣa*) is the immediate cognition of objects.
* It can be further analyzed into two types: (1) cognition of the particular/thing (shi 事), and (2) cognition of the universal/principle (li 理).
* Cognition of the particular/thing refers to knowing objects directly without reasoning or verbal testimony, because they are coarse and near.
* Cognition of the universal/principle refers to knowing objects in the realm of desire according to Abhidharma theory.

## 言比量者 3 Inference

* Inference (*anumāna*) refers to knowing *dharma*s through analogy and reasoning.
* It can be analyzed into two kinds: (1) knowing the particular/thing and (2) knowing the universal/principle.

## 言教量者 4 Scripture as a Means of Valid Cognition

* Teaching (*āgama*) as a means of valid cognition refers to teachings by which one knows profound *dharma*s that it would be beyond one's capacity to learn on one's own.
* It can be further analyzed into two forms: (1) knowing the particular/thing and (2) knowing the universal/principle.



## 次辨其相 2 Analysis Of Characteristics

* **Inference:** This section discusses the three types of inference:
    * Analogy from the same species (同類比): using one example to infer knowledge about others in the same category. Three sub-types are explained: inference from part to whole, inference from effect to cause, and inference from common relation.
    * Giving an example of lower quality for other cases of higher quality (以劣比勝): using a less valuable thing as an analogy for something more valuable.
    * Giving an example of higher quality for other cases of lower quality (以勝比劣): using a more valuable thing as an analogy for something less valuable.

* **Teaching as a means of cognition:** This section explains how teachings can be used to gain knowledge about things that are not directly perceivable. Three types are discussed:
    * Objects in another time (異時法)
    * Objects in another place (異處法)
    * Objects in the same time and place but requiring explanation (同時同處之法)

* **Analysis of Pramāṇa in terms of the rank of cultivation:** This section analyzes the three *pramāṇ*as (perception, inference, teaching) in relation to five ranks of spiritual development: gotra formed by learning, gotra formed by nature, determinate comprehension, ten stages, and Buddhahood. Three different analyses are presented:
    * Beginning and end combined: The first two ranks are combined as one, the last two as another, leaving the middle rank unchanged.

    * Middle opened up to combine beginning and end: The first two ranks and the last two ranks are combined respectively, while the middle rank remains separate.
    * Beginning combined, end opened up: The first three ranks are combined as one, the last two remain separate.

## The Theory Of Apoha In Kuiji'S Cheng Weishi Lun Shuji1

* Dignāga, a fifth- to sixth-century Indian Buddhist logician, is considered the founder of "New Logic" in India.
* His main work, Pramāṇasamuccaya (PS), integrated two traditions of Indian logic: debate and the theory of knowledge. 
* PS has a different structure from Dignāga's earlier work, Nyāyamukha (NMukh), which focuses on debate techniques.

* The fifth chapter of PS deals with the theory of *apoha*, or "exclusion/negation," which is central to inference and verbal testimony.
* This theory suggests that linguistic items refer not to individual objects or universals, but to mental constructions based on exclusion of others.
* Dignāga's theory of *apoha* is also hinted at in NMukh, where the concept of "exclusion of others" appears in the context of inference.

##  




## 2.1

* Dignāga proposes two *pramāṇa*s: direct perception and inference.
* Direct perception cognizes unique objects, while inference cognizes general characteristics.
* Dignāga considers "exclusion of others" as a mental construction representing general characteristics, unlike other schools that view it as a real universal.
* He classifies cognitions into immediate perception (pramāṇa) and mediated conceptual cognition (including both pramāṇa like inference and verbal cognition, and non-pramāṇa or erroneous cognitions).

## 2.2

* Dignāga uses a hierarchy of universals to specify "others" excluded by linguistic expressions.
* This hierarchy resembles the Vaiśeṣika categories and subcategories.
* The highest category is "the knowable," divided into "existent" and "non-existent."
* "Existent" further divides into substance, quality, and action.
* Each category has subcategories, forming a hierarchical structure.
* A word excludes referents at the same level and those excluded by higher-level universals.
* Words not only exclude but also generate definite knowledge of higher-order universals and may entail expectation or indifference to other things.
* Dignāga's *apoha* theory explains semantic phenomena like synonymy (two words referring to the same object) and modification (modifier-modified relationship).

## 3.1

* Kuiji discusses the Sarvāstivādin categories of nāma-, pada-, and vyañjana-kāya, focusing on what constitutes the object of each.
* He refers to Dignāga's two kinds of objects: particular or "own" characteristic (zixiang 自相) and general characteristic (gongxiang 共相).
* Particular characteristics are the objects of direct perception and cannot be referred to by words, while general characteristics are the objects of words and conventional cognition.
* Kuiji distinguishes between two usages of "general characteristic": the Sarvāstivādin view of properties like suffering and emptiness, and Dignāga's view of "exclusion/negation of others."

* He uses the example of the word "fire" excluding non-fire to illustrate the latter.
* Kuiji presents a hierarchy of dharmas in terms of universals and particulars, starting with "defiled" and "undefiled" dharmas and ending with atoms.
* He argues that words cannot refer to either particular or general characteristics because all dharmas are ineffable.

* Conventional language is used to express these concepts provisionally but does not truly refer to them.

## 3.2

* **Kuiji's discussion on metaphorical transference (*upacāra*)**:
    * Explains "general characteristic" as exclusion/negation of others, exemplified by the concept of "color".
    * Defines general characteristic as a concept arising from negation of particular characteristics.
* **Hierarchy of Dharmas**:
    * Outlines a hierarchy of *dharmas*: emptiness and non-self (general), five aggregates, twelve spheres, kinds/classes of entities, entities themselves, and finally atoms.
    * Argues that even atoms are general characteristics, and particulars are ineffable.
    * Concludes that ultimately, neither general nor particular characteristics truly exist.
* **Conceptual Cognition and Inference**:
    * Identifies conceptual cognition of "blue" with inference (*biliangzhi*).
    * Explains visual perception takes the particular characteristic as its object, while mental cognition takes the general characteristic as its object.
    * Argues that judgment of "blue" is formed by excluding non-blue things.
* **Conventional Cognition and Verbal Designations**:
    * States conventional cognition only takes the general characteristic as its object.
    * Explains verbal designations also refer to the general characteristic, exemplified by "blue lotus".

* **Kuiji's Understanding of Dignāga's Epistemology**:
    * Recognizes two valid cognitions: perception (particular characteristic) and inference (general characteristic).
    * Defines general characteristic as exclusion of others, applicable to both inference and verbal cognition.
    * Acknowledges the ineffability of the particular characteristic and its inaccessibility to conceptual cognition.
    * Suggests a relative distinction between particular and universal characteristics, potentially differing from Dignāga's view.

## A Comparison between the Indian and Chinese Interpretations of the Antinomic Reason (Viruddhāvyabhicārin)

* This paper compares Kuiji's interpretation of the antinomic reason (*viruddhāvyabhicārin*) with interpretations by Indian commentators on Dignāga's *Nyāyamukha*.
* The antinomic reason is a fallacious reason that fails to establish its intended thesis.

* Dignāga classifies it as an "inconclusive" reason (*anaikāntika*) because, unlike other inconclusive reasons, it fulfills the three characteristics of a valid logical reason (*trairūpya*).
* The antinomic reason leads to contradictory conclusions on the same subject due to two acceptable reasons.

* Dignāga uses the example of sound being both permanent (because it is audible) and impermanent (because it is a product) to illustrate this fallacy.
* He argues that *viruddhāvyabhicārin* arises from inconsistent metaphysical systems, like the Vaiśeṣika's acceptance of eternal universals.

* Dignāga suggests relying on scriptures based on perception (*pratyakṣāgama*) to determine truth in such cases.




# Dharmakīrti's Interpretation of *Viruddhāvyabhicārin*

- Dharmakīrti separates *viruddhāvyabhicārin* from Dignāga's wheel of reason.
- He considers it part of "scripturally based inference" (*āgamāpekṣānumāna*), not inference based on real entities (*vastubalapravṛttānumāna*).
- According to Dharmakīrti, *viruddhāvyabhicārin* arises in metaphysical contexts outside empirical reality.

# The Role of *Viruddhāvyabhicārin* in Indian Logic

- Dignāga used *viruddhāvyabhicārin* as a tool for debate.
- Śaṅkarasvāmin, following Dignāga, presents it as one type of inconclusive reason.
- Commentators like Haribhadra and Pārśvadeva analyze the compound *viruddhāvyabhicārin* and explain its components.

# Kuiji's Explanation Of The Viruddhāvyabhicārin Section In Np

- Kuiji, a student of Xuanzang, wrote a commentary on NP that sheds light on early Chinese Buddhist logic.
- His commentary on *viruddhāvyabhicārin* is divided into three parts: the problem of the name, the presentation of two proofs, and a conclusion. 




## 2.1 Analysis Of The Compound

* Kuiji offers two interpretations for the compound *viruddhāvyabhicārin*: genitive tatpuruṣa (*xiangwei zhi jueding*) and instrumental tatpuruṣa (*jueding ling xiangwei*).
* The genitive tatpuruṣa interpretation is considered less problematic.
* Kuiji's instrumental tatpuruṣa interpretation is deemed unreasonable because it reverses the order of components in a compound.

## 2.2 Explanation of the two proofs

* Kuiji identifies the opponent presenting the second proof as a *Śabdotpattivādin*, who believes sound is produced.
* This differs from the Śabdābhivyaktivādin, who claims sound is merely manifested.
* The *Śabdotpattivādin* distinguishes three aspects of sound: mere sound, sound-hood, and signifier.

* Sound-hood is considered eternally existing and independent of the signifier.
* The Śabdābhivyaktivādin accepts "coming into being immediately after intentional effort" as a valid reason for sound's existence.
* This contrasts with the *Śabdotpattivādin*'s acceptance of "being a product" as a reason.



## 2.3 How Do We Determine The Winner Of The Debate?

*  Kuiji aims to reconstruct a debate between a Vaiśeṣika and a *Śabdotpattivādin* regarding the impermanence of sound.
* Neither side's argument is conclusive, resulting in a stalemate. 
* Śaṅkarasvāmin clarifies that both reasons lead to doubt, making the debate inconclusive.
* Kuiji interprets this as avoiding the misconception that presenting a counter-proof automatically grants victory.
* He analyzes pratyakṣāgama (*xianjiao*) in three ways and concludes that the Vaiśeṣika wins based on this interpretation.

## 2.4 Kuiji'S Typology Of Viruddhāvyabhicārin

* Kuiji presents a typology of *viruddhāvyabhicārin* based on three situations: refuting an opponent, defending one's position, and arguing from common ground.
* He connects *viruddhāvyabhicārin* to the fallacy of "thesis contradicted by another inference" (*anumānaviruddha*).
* Kuiji classifies four types of *viruddha* that apply to *viruddhāvyabhicārin*, depending on which element of the thesis is contradictory.

* He focuses on the typology based on the three situations where counter-proofs can be constructed: 
    * **Pattern 1:** Both sides argue from common ground (gongbiliang).
    * **Pattern 2:** One side uses grounds accepted by the other (*tabiliang*), while the other uses grounds they accept themselves (*zibiliang*).
    * **Pattern 3:** Similar to Pattern 2, but with reversed roles.

* Kuiji's typology highlights how *viruddhāvyabhicārin* can be used to reveal self-contradictions in an opponent's system, particularly in Patterns 2 and 3.
* He seems to downplay the "antinomy" aspect in Pattern 1, treating it as a mere representation of opposing opinions.

## 3 Xuanzang'S Proof Of Consciousness-Only And Its Relation To Viruddhāvyabhicārin

* Xuanzang presented a proof for consciousness-only based on the ultimate viewpoint.
* This proof avoids fallacies by using the qualifier "from the ultimate viewpoint".
* Wŏnhyo challenged this proof with a counter-proof based on the Sarvāstivādin's viewpoint, leading to a *viruddhāvyabhicārin*.

* Kuiji defended Xuanzang's proof by arguing that Wŏnhyo's counter-proof is not a valid *viruddhāvyabhicārin*.
* He claims that both proofs should be of the same type (*gongbiliang*), and Wŏnhyo's is actually a *zibiliang* type.

## 4 Conclusion

* Kuiji's interpretations of *viruddhāvyabhicārin* are similar to Jain commentators, but his second interpretation is grammatically problematic.
* Kuiji uses the example of the *Śabdotpattivādin* to illustrate a debate where both sides avoid committing fallacies.
* In a debate, the winner is determined by "perception and scripture," favoring the Vaiśeṣika position in the given examples.

* Kuiji's typology of *viruddhāvyabhicārin* relies on his classification of inference types: self-accepted grounds, other-accepted grounds, and commonly accepted grounds.
* This typology creates rules for debate, requiring counter-proofs to match the type of the initial proof.

* Kuiji interprets Xuanzang's proof as *gongbiliang* to avoid Wŏnhyo's *viruddhāvyabhicārin* challenge.
* He deems Wŏnhyo's counter-proof invalid because it is a *zibiliang* type, not matching the initial *gongbiliang* proof.

## Introductory Remarks

* Xuanzang's translation of Śaṅkarasvāmin's *Nyāyapraveśa* (Introduction to Logic) marks the beginning of systematic study of Indian Buddhist logic in China.
* The treatise deals with methods of defending and refuting theses through sound arguments, focusing on rules of rational debate rather than formal logic.
* It lists nine examples of "pseudo-theses" (unacceptable topics for debate), including statements incompatible with experience or common sense.

## Self-Refutation in Early Tang Buddhist Logic

* Sentences [1] ("My mother is that barren woman") and [2] ("All statements are false") exemplify the fallacy of "inconsistency with one's own words" (*zi yu xiangwei*).
* Both sentences are internally flawed, rendering them untenable on logical grounds alone.
* Sentence [1] is a case of *contradictio in terminis*, while Sentence [2] is self-referential and self-refuting.

## Interpretations by Xuanzang's Disciples

* Xuanzang's disciples Wengui, Shentai, and Kuiji provided insightful interpretations of Sentences [1] and [2].
* They viewed the fallacy of "inconsistency with one's own words" as a rhetorical tool to denounce heterodox views.
* Their commentaries offer valuable insights into the early development of Buddhist logic in East Asia.

## Secondary Scholarship

* Limited scholarship exists on this topic, with Sueki Takehiro briefly mentioning Sentence [2] and Janusz Chmielewski analyzing Kuiji's commentary in a comparative context.
* Chinese scholars like Chen Daqi, Shen Jianying, and Zheng Weihong have also discussed these sentences, aligning them with relevant passages from Shentai's work.





## The Interpretation Of Wengui

* **Wengui's Grasp of Indian Logic:**
    * Wengui was a disciple of Xuanzang and known for his understanding of Indian logic.
    * His commentary on Śaṅkarasvāmin's Introduction to Logic is significant but relatively unknown.

* **Inconsistency with One's Own Words:**
    * This fallacy occurs when the subject and predicate of a statement are mutually contradictory terms.
    * Example: "My mother is that barren woman." 
    * Wengui emphasizes the semantic incongruence between the words, rather than ontological reasons for incompatibility.

* **"All Statements Are False":**
    * This statement is self-refuting because it implies its own falsehood.
    * Wengui highlights the use of the universal quantifier "all" and the contradiction between asserting all statements are false while assuming one's own statement is true.

* **Intended Meaning vs. Explicit Content:**
    * Wengui distinguishes between what is explicitly stated in a thesis and its intended meaning.
    * This distinction is important for understanding how debaters may implicitly accept certain assumptions while denying them explicitly.




# The Interpretation Of Wengui

*  Wengui discusses a non-Buddhist claim, "All statements are false," and its refutation by the Buddha.
* He analyzes the fallacy of violating one's own statement and explores ways to avoid self-reference in such claims.
* Wengui presents an improved version of the non-Buddhist claim, excluding the statement itself from the set of all false statements.
* He argues that this revised claim is still unacceptable because it leads to a contradiction with the concept of meaningful language.

# The Intepretation Of Shentai

* Shentai offers a unique refutation of "All statements are false" by presenting it as a paradox leading to unacceptable conclusions regardless of its truth value.
* He draws parallels between his argument and a passage from the Indian treatise *Treatise on Accordance with Truth*.
* Shentai addresses the issue of excluding the problematic statement from the scope of "all" sentences, suggesting that this leads to infinite regress.
* His analysis highlights the problems inherent in predicating truth and falsity of statements, particularly those involving self-reference.

## The Interpretation Of Kuiji

* Kuiji was a renowned disciple of Xuanzang who compiled the standard early Tang commentary on Śaṅkarasvāmin's *Introduction to Logic*.

* Kuiji's interpretation of the fallacy "inconsistency with one's own words" is similar to Wengui's but focuses on the mutual exclusivity of attributes within a subject rather than the coexistence of contrary terms.
* He analyzes two sentences, Sentence [1] ("my mother", implying she has a child, and "stone woman," implying she has no child) and Sentence [2] ("all statements are false").

* Kuiji attributes his analysis of Sentence [2] to Dignāga, but this attribution is challenged by Janusz Chmielewski due to the peculiar grammatical structure of the Chinese sentence.
*  Despite the debate about Dignāga's involvement, Kuiji's argument against Sentence [2] shares similarities with Shentai's and Wengui's analyses.

* Kuiji extends the concept of "inconsistency with one's own words" to include statements that contradict the speaker's philosophical stance. This view was later challenged by Dingbin who emphasized the distinction between inconsistency with one's own school and inconsistency with one's own words.





## Later Japanese And Chinese Interpretations

* Xuanzang's translations of Indian logic manuals, along with commentaries, reached Japan in the eighth century, influencing scholastic tradition.
* Japanese commentaries on logic focused on the fallacy of "inconsistency with one's own words," often repeating arguments from Chinese predecessors like Kuiji.
* Zenju, a Hossō monk, offered a distinction between "total" and "partial" inconsistency, expanding on Kuiji's ideas.

## The Decline of Buddhist Logic in China

* After flourishing in the seventh century, the study of Buddhist logic declined in China.
* Later scholarship lacked originality, with Ming dynasty commentaries criticized for simplifications and misunderstandings.
* A Ming dynasty example demonstrates a decline in technical vocabulary and logical insight compared to earlier Tang commentaries.

## The Fallacy as a Rhetorical Tool

* Wŏnhyo, a Korean monk, used the fallacy of "inconsistency with one's own words" in debate, challenging tenets specific to Xuanzang's school.
* He distinguished between interpretations of an opponent's claim, showing a more nuanced approach than earlier discussions.

## Buddhist Perspectives on Self-Refutation

* Commentaries often attribute self-refuting statements like Sentence [2] to non-Buddhist "heretics."
* Indian Buddhists, particularly Mādhyamikas, were skilled in defending their own claims against similar refutations.
* Nāgārjuna addressed criticisms that his doctrine of emptiness implied nihilism and the falsity of all statements.

## Zhizhou's Response to Self-Refutation

* Zhizhou acknowledged similarities between Buddhist views on language and self-refuting positions but emphasized Buddhism's acceptance of meaningful communication through words.
* He differentiated the Buddhist stance by introducing a more nuanced understanding of "false," contrasting it with the approach taken in earlier examples. 




## Conclusions

* One interesting aspect of research into Chinese commentaries on Indian treatises about the "science of reasons" is the issue of specifically Chinese developments within the system transmitted from India, that is, the "sinification" of Indian Buddhist logic. However, any conclusion regarding this point can only be tentative due to uncertainty about whether ideas expressed by Chinese commentators are truly their own or based on unwritten Indian sources.

* The most conspicuous source of inspiration in most cases appears to be *The Treatise on Accordance with Truth* attributed to Vasubandhu. This work presents refutations of sentences like "A virgin has a child" and "I reject all that is said" in a section devoted to "sophisms." It focuses on making the opponent concede defeat in debate rather than thoroughly analyzing those propositions.

* In contrast, Chinese monks try to elucidate the exact nature of fallacies exemplified in sentences like "My mother is that barren woman" and "All statements are false" using the technical vocabulary of Dignāga's science of reasons. They achieved remarkable results in doing so.

* Wengui's commentary offers a convincing explanation of the difference between the two exemplifications of "inconsistency with one's own words," explicating Sentence 1 as a thesis whose subject and predicate are contrary terms, and Sentence 2 as a thesis that entails contradiction between itself and its intention (i.e., the assertion that "All statements are false" is a true statement).

* Shentai views Sentence 2 as a paradoxical statement forcing its proponent to admit a self-defeating or absurd conclusion regardless of whether it is true or false. His commentary, though logically erroneous, deals with the abstract and difficult problem of predicating truth and falsity of statements about all (remaining) statements to a considerable level of sophistication.

* Kuiji's interpretation, historically the most influential, clearly spells out the contradiction underlying Sentence 1. It doesn't add much beyond the opinions of Wengui and Shentai except for a convoluted fragment attributing the self-refutation of Sentence 2 to incongruence between the thesis itself and its two constituent parts.

* The findings confirm that the development of Buddhist logic in East Asia was hindered by a lack of sustained interest in the theory of reasoning among the Chinese. Both secular Chinese culture and Chinese interpretations of Buddhist doctrine provided few incentives and conceptual tools to identify and pursue purely logical issues underlying the system of the "science of reasons."

* Whenever interpretations of Chinese commentators appear unsatisfactory or incorrect, they reveal inherent limitations of the system they were working within rather than their own misunderstandings. Wengui's commentary provides some examples of formulations which are linguistically or conceptually more precise than the Indian text that might have inspired them.

* A more definite statement regarding the independent contributions of Chinese monks would require a thorough survey of passages from South Asian works dealing with similar subject matter. The present article aims to provide reference points for those who are more competent to carry this discussion further.





##  A Re-examination of the Relationship between the *Awakening* of Faith and Dilun School Thought, Focusing on the Works of Huiyuan

* The *Awakening of Faith* is considered a seminal text in East Asian Buddhism but its origin is debated.
* Some scholars argue it originated from the Dilun School, influenced by the Laṅkâvatāra-sūtra.
* This interpretation suggests the *Awakening of Faith*'s view that Thusness (an unconditioned dharma) is the basis of conditioned phenomena might stem from a misinterpretation of the Laṅkâvatāra-sūtra.

## Huiyuan's Understanding of Defiled Phenomena

* Huiyuan, a prominent Dilun School master, had a different understanding of defiled phenomena compared to the *Awakening of Faith*.
* While the *Awakening of Faith* posits defiled phenomena as modes of Thusness, Huiyuan sees them as constructed by false discrimination (*wangqing*), with Thusness serving as the basis.

##  Huiyuan's Distinction Between Conditioned and Unconditioned Dharmas

* Like Paramârtha, Huiyuan distinguishes between conditioned and unconditioned *dharmas*.
* He differentiates two aspects of Thusness: "natural purity" (*xingjing*) and "expedient means" (*fangbian*). 
* True consciousness (*zhenshi*), representing the Buddha's perfect wisdom, is considered unconditioned and unchanging.

## The True Consciousness Adjusting to Falsity

* Huiyuan's concept of true consciousness "adjusting to falsity" (*suiwang*) explains how it serves as the basis for defiled phenomena.
* This adjustment doesn't imply a change in the true consciousness but rather its manifestation through false discrimination.




## Methodological Remarks

* This paper investigates whether the key doctrinal feature of the *Awakening of Faith* is present in the Dilun School through an examination of Huiyuan's works.
* A major difficulty is the lack of precise dating for Huiyuan's works and when he became familiar with the *Awakening of Faith*.

* Some of Huiyuan's works cite the *Awakening of Faith*, while others do not, suggesting some were written before his exposure to it.
* Historical evidence suggests the *Awakening of Faith* likely arrived in the North after Tanqian returned to Chang'an in 587, making it probable that Huiyuan composed some works before encountering it.

* Some of Huiyuan's works, like *Dasheng yi zhang*, appear to have undergone revisions, meaning not all parts were necessarily written under the influence of the *Awakening of Faith*.
* The working hypothesis is that passages in Huiyuan's works showing no doctrinal similarity with the *Awakening of Faith* could be authentic samples of Dilun School thought predating the *Awakening of Faith*.

* Passages heavily influenced by the *Awakening of Faith*, such as "Chapter on the Eight Consciousnesses" in *Dasheng yi zhang* and *An Exegesis* of the Meaning of the Awakening of Faith, will be avoided.
* Passages with direct or indirect references to the *Awakening of Faith* in neighboring passages will also be excluded.

## A Brief Review Of Recent Scholarship

* Yoshizu Yoshihide's work focuses on Huiyuan's concept of "dependent origination based on Buddha-nature."
    * He connects this concept to the Yogâcāra doctrine identifying Buddha-nature with the storehouse consciousness.
    * Yoshizu relies heavily on Huiyuan's "Chapter on the Eight Consciousnesses," which is influenced by the *Awakening of Faith*.

* Ibuki Atsushi explicitly states that Huiyuan incorporates doctrines from the *Awakening of Faith*.
    * He also primarily uses the "Chapter on the Eight Consciousnesses" for his interpretation.

* Aoki Takashi, while focusing on Dilun School sources, still presents a view similar to Yoshizu's concept of "dependent origination based on Buddha-nature."
    * He suggests that *tathāgatagarbha* is the basis of all dharmas and defilements arise from it.
    * However, Aoki doesn't adequately address how defilements could originate from Thusness.

## The Distinction Between the Aspect of "Natural Purity" and the Aspect of "Expedient Means"

* Huiyuan's use of the contrast between "natural purity" and "expedient means" suggests a dualistic rather than monistic view.
    * He applies this distinction to concepts like bodhi ("wisdom").

## (Quotation 2)

* Bodhi from the perspective of expedient means arises due to conditions and is realized based on its inherent substance (Buddha-nature).
*  Merits of bodhi can be viewed from two perspectives: arising from conditions like an ornament crafted by a craftsman or arising from Buddha-nature like an ornament made of gold.

## (Quotation 3)

* Bodhi from the perspective of natural purity exists inherently, but its manifestation depends on conditions.
* Two ways to investigate this bodhi:
    * Considering reality in relation to conditions:  manifestation requires both substance and conditions.
    * Considering reality without reference to conditions: neither hidden nor disclosed; inherent nature of dharmas is always present.

## (Quotation 4)

* Bodhi from the perspective of expedient means does not exist eternally for worldlings, as it is a reward arising from causes.


## (Quotation 5)

* Dharma-body has two aspects:
    * Dharmatā-body (originally hidden, now revealed), belonging to nirvāṇa from the aspect of natural purity.
    * Real-enjoyment-body, born from cultivation as an expedient means, belonging to nirvāṇa from the aspect of expedient means. 




## The Notion Of The "True Consciousness" (Zhenshi 真識)

* Huiyuan differentiates wisdom into two types: the aspect of natural purity and the aspect of expedient means.
* Under the aspect of natural purity, he introduces the concept of "true consciousness" (*zhenshi* 真識), also known as *tathāgatagarbha*, which refers to the inherently pure mind that illuminates the Dharma-realm.

## (Quotation 7)

* Liberation also has two aspects: liberation from its own nature and liberation through expedient means.
* The true consciousness is never defiled, only covered by defilements.

* Huiyuan emphasizes that the true consciousness does not become impure, but appears impure due to being veiled by false defilements.
* When defilements cease, the true consciousness is revealed.

## 1 [That The True Consciousness] Adjusts To Defilements:

* According to Huiyuan, the twelve links of dependent origination arise from the true mind, which adjusts to defilements and thus gives rise to birth and death.

## 2 [That The True Consciousness] Adjusts To Causes And Conditions:


*  Huiyuan uses the analogy of water to explain that the same substance of the true consciousness transforms into wisdom and ignorance by adjusting to conditions.

## 3 The notion of "dependent origination [based on the] *substance of* tathāgatagarbha":

* Huiyuan explains that dependent origination based on the substance of the pure Dharma-realm, i.e., the *tathāgatagarbha*, constructs both birth and death and *nirvāṇ*a.


## 4 That The Defiled Consciousness Is Based On (Yi 依) The True Consciousness

* Huiyuan states that false consciousness is produced based on the true consciousness, and that birth and death are transformed by false consciousness based on the permanent body (Dharma-body).





## 5 The Function Of The True Consciousness:

* Dependent origination can be understood in two ways regarding the true consciousness.
    * First, dependent origination is the function of the true consciousness (*zhenyong yinyuan*), where the nature (tathāgatagarbha) becomes defiled even while remaining undefiled, giving rise to the twelve links of dependent origination.
    * Second, dependent origination is the substance of the true consciousness, meaning that tathāgatagarbha is the substance of dependent origination, although without the marks of dependent origination.

## A Clear Separation Of Huiyuan From The Awakening Of Faith?

* Huiyuan reconciles the idea of an unchanging true consciousness with its relation to dependent origination (which implies change) by introducing the concept of "false discrimination" (*wangqing*).
* False discrimination covers the true consciousness, leading to the appearance of defilement and the arising of birth and death.
* Despite this apparent combination, the true consciousness remains untouched and unchanged because false discrimination does not affect its nature.



# False Discrimination and True Consciousness: Huiyuan's Distinction

* Huiyuan argues that false discrimination is not a mode or aspect of true consciousness, but rather an adventitious defilement superimposed upon it.
* This means that false discrimination does not taint the true consciousness, which remains untainted despite its presence.
* The true consciousness adjusts to falsity without being transformed into false consciousness.

# The Simile Of Snake And Rope: The Indispensability Of The Substance

* Huiyuan uses the simile of snake and rope to illustrate his point that defiled phenomena are not truly existent, but rather misconstructions based on a true foundation.
* In this simile, the rope represents the true consciousness (Thusness), while the perceived snake represents false discrimination.
* Just as the snake is not truly real, defiled phenomena arise from the misinterpretation of the true nature of reality.

# Conclusion

* Huiyuan's thought differs significantly from that of the *Awakening of Faith*, particularly in its understanding of the relationship between true consciousness and false discrimination.
* Scholars should be cautious about attributing *Awakening of Faith* doctrines to the Dilun School, as they may represent later interpretations rather than authentic Dilun thought.
* Further research is needed to disentangle these influences and gain a clearer understanding of the development of Buddhist thought in sixth century China. 




## 1.1 Parameters For The Two Hindrances

* Throughout Mahāyāna texts, hindrances are used to distinguish between the practices of Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna paths.
* Hīnayāna adherents focus on afflictive hindrances while bodhisattvas address both afflictive and cognitive hindrances.
* Yogâcāra associates this with the realization of emptiness (*śūnyatā*) by bodhisattvas, leading to full enlightenment (*bodhi*), unlike Hīnayāna practitioners who attain only *nirvāṇ*a.

* The development of a systematic description of hindrances in both Yogâcāra and Tathāgatagarbha occurred later compared to other doctrines.
* Early mentions are brief, serving as markers for practice completion or stage attainment.

* In the Yogâcāra system (as understood by Kuiji), hindrances are mentioned briefly in texts like the *Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra*, *Yogâcārabhūmi*-śāstra*, and *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*.
* The *Madhyânta-*vibhāga* has a chapter on hindrances, but its articulation doesn't align with the rest of the Yogâcāra system.

* Xuanzang's translation of the *Fodijing lun* (*Buddhabhūmi-sūtra-śāstra*) provides the most comprehensive definition of the two hindrances in the Weishi (唯識) system, copied almost verbatim into the *Cheng weishi lun*.
* Wonhyo's *Ijang ui* (二障 義) is a significant treatise on the two hindrances, comparing and contrasting Yogâcāra and Tathāgatagarbha systems.

* Wonhyo relies on Xuanzang's translations for the Yogâcāra system and works like the *Śrīmālādevī-sūtra*, *Ratnagotravibhāga*, and *Awakening of Mahāyāna Faith* for the Tathāgatagarbha system.

## 1.2 Discrepancies


* Both Yogâcāra and Tathāgatagarbha systems use hindrances to distinguish between afflictive and cognitive problems, with afflictive hindrances being addressed by Hīnayāna practices and cognitive hindrances requiring bodhisattva compassion and insight into emptiness.
* However, there are discrepancies in categorizing mental factors as afflictive or cognitive (e.g., views, doubt, pride).

* Questions arise about the limitations of Hīnayāna practitioners regarding cognitive issues and the potential overlap between afflictive and cognitive hindrances.
* Huiyuan's investigation aimed to understand the Mahāyāna perspective on the relationship between these two types of hindrances.

* He found that the understanding varied depending on factors like the practitioner's system, path stage, applied antidotes, and context.
* Huiyuan established a precedent for explaining hindrances using the framework of the four afflictive entrenchments and the nescience entrenchment from texts like the *Śrīmālādevī-sūtra*.

# The Five Entrenchments

* The four entrenchments as taught in Ta-thāgatagarbha texts are:
    * *jian yichu zhudi* (見一處住地) entrenchment of identity-view
    * *yuai zhudi* (欲愛住地) entrenchment of attachment to objects in the desire realm. 
    * *seai zhudi* (色愛住地) entrenchment of attachment to things in the form realm. 
    * *youai zhudi* (有愛住地) entrenchment of attachment to objects in the formless realm.

* The fifth entrenchment is entrenched nescience (*wuming zhudi* 無明住 地; avidyâvāsa-*bhūmi*) referring to nescience in its latent aspect.
* These five entrenchments serve as a framework for understanding afflictive and cognitive hindrances.

# Three Levels of Interpretation

* Huiyuan identifies three levels of interpretation regarding the relationship between the five entrenchments and the hindrances:
    * **Level 1:** The four afflictive entrenchments are directly equivalent to afflictive hindrances, and the nescience entrenchment is directly equivalent to cognitive hindrances.
    * **Level 2:** The intrinsic natures of all five entrenchments constitute afflictive hindrances, while inability to properly cognize distinct phenomena constitutes cognitive hindrances.

    * **Level 3:** The essences of the five entrenchments, as well as obscuration of cognition in regard to both principle and phenomena, are taken to be the afflictive hindrances, leaving only object-discriminating cognition itself as the cognitive hindrances.

#  Comparison with Yogâcāra

* Huiyuan's analysis predates Wonhyo's *Iju* and Xuanzang's translation of the *FDJL*, which provide more systematic discussions of the hindrances in Yogâcāra.
* Huiyuan's work may have influenced Yogâcāra scholars to develop their own more detailed articulation of the hindrances.



## 3 The Completed Yogâcāra System Of The Hindrances

* This section elaborates on the system of hindrances in Yogâcāra Buddhism, drawing comparisons between Huiyuan's work and Xuanzang's *CWSL*.

* Afflictive hindrances are primarily mental factors that cause suffering, while cognitive hindrances stem from misunderstanding phenomena.
* Both types of hindrances originate from erroneous views about self and reality. 
* The *CWSL* acknowledges the overlap between afflictive and cognitive hindrances, citing Huiyuan's work as a source for this understanding.

* The *CWSL* explains that while both hindrances can obstruct both *nirvāṇ*a and *bodhi*, they are named based on their most prominent function.

##  The Relationship Between Afflictive and Cognitive Hindrances

* Huiyuan's analysis, based on Tathāgatagarbha texts, differs from the *CWSL*'s Yogâcāra-based analysis regarding the relationship between afflictive and cognitive hindrances.
* The *CWSL* states that practitioners of the two vehicles only remove afflictive hindrances, while bodhisattvas remove both types. Huiyuan takes a more nuanced position, suggesting that both groups partially remove both types but emphasize different aspects.

* Both Huiyuan and the *CWSL* acknowledge that the naming of hindrances reflects their most prominent tendencies, recognizing the interconnectedness of afflictive and cognitive hindrances at a deeper level.

# 4 Observations

* Both Yogâcāra and Tathāgatagarbha thought share a similar understanding of hindrances as *prajñapti*, which are designatory labels used to indicate distinctions among things that cannot be clearly discriminated in reality.

* The human mind cannot be divided into pieces, just like reality cannot be divided into distinctions between the two truths, essence and function (*tiyong*), or emptiness and existence.
 
# Appendix: Translation22 Of The Two Hindrances

* This section provides a translation of a passage from the *Śāstra-dharma-śūnyatā-nāma-sūtra*, which discusses the nature of mental disturbances and their relationship to nescience.
* It explains the concept of "concomitance" (being associated with) in relation to different types of consciousness and mental disturbances.

* The passage highlights the distinction between active mental disturbances, which are considered concomitant with the mind, and innate mental disturbances, which share the same essence as the mind and are said to be non-concomitant.

# 1 First Level
## 1.1 Defining The Characteristics Of The Hindrances

* This section explains how the four entrenchments of affliction are classified as afflictive hindrances and the entrenchment of nescience is classified as a cognitive hindrance.
* It uses the *Śāstra-dharma-śūnyatā-nāma-sūtra* and the *Buddhist Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra* to support this classification.

## 1.2 Explanation Of Terminology

* This section explains why the four entrenchments are labeled as afflictive hindrances while nescience alone is considered a cognitive hindrance.
* It argues that although both types of hindrances can obstruct cognition, the four entrenchments are more directly associated with active distress and the instigation of negative karma.

## 1.3 Stages Of Their Elimination

* This section outlines two levels of understanding regarding the elimination of hindrances: distinctions between the greater and lesser vehicles, and distinctions within the greater vehicle itself.
* It explains that adherents of the two vehicles primarily focus on removing afflictive hindrances, while bodhisattvas aim to extinguish both afflictive and cognitive hindrances.

## 1.3.1.2 Mutual Defining Of Superior And Inferior

* Adherents of the two vehicles are inferior in understanding, only removing afflictions.
* Bodhisattvas subdue mental disturbances broadly, removing both kinds of hindrances.

## 1.3.1.3 Comprehensive View From The Perspective Of Reality

* Both adherents of the two vehicles and bodhisattvas remove both kinds of hindrances.

## 1.3.2 Distinctions between mundane and supramundane in the Greater Vehicle

* Stages up to understanding and practice are called "mundane".
* Stages from the first ground upward are called "supramundane".

## 1.3.2.1 Ignoring The Coarse And Elaborating The Subtle

* Bodhisattvas who have not entered the grounds do not remove both hindrances.
* From the first ground and above, they remove both hindrances.

## 1.3.2.2 The contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized

* Those in the mundane levels prior to the grounds only remove afflictive hindrances.
* Those in the first ground and above only remove cognitive hindrances.

## 1.3.2.3 Mutual Defining Of Superior And Inferior

* Those who are in the stages prior to the grounds are weak in understanding and only remove afflictive hindrances.
* Those who are in the first ground and above are of superior understanding and remove both kinds of hindrances together.

## 1.3.2.4 In Actuality

* Practitioners at both mundane and supramundane levels remove both kinds of hindrances.

## 1.3.2.4.1 Afflictive Hindrances

* There are two types: seed-bound and fruition-bound.
* Seed-bound afflictions are removed prior to the grounds. Fruition-bound afflictions are removed from the first ground and above.

## 1.3.2.4.1.1 Seed-Bound

* Two further types: those arising with intentional activity, and those arising from habit energies.
* Afflictions proper are fully eliminated by śrāvakas, *pratyekabuddha*s, and those with the nature [for bodhisattvahood].
* Habitual afflictions are finished from the stage of seed-nature up to the first ground.

## 1.3.2.4.1.2 Fruition-Bound

* Two types: those arising with intentional activity, and those arising naturally by habituation.
* Afflictions proper (attachment to Buddha, bodhi, etc.) are gradually removed starting from the first ground up to the eighth ground.

## 1.3.2.4.2 Cognitive Hindrances

* Two types: confusion in regard to appearances, and confusion in regard to reality.

## 1.3.2.4.2.1 Nescience of confusion in regard to appearances

* Two types: confusing natures when confused about appearances, and confusing appearances when confused about natures.
* Removed by śrāvakas, *pratyekabuddha*s, and bodhisattvas in the stage of seed-nature.

## 1.3.2.4.2.2 Confusion In Regard To Reality

* Two types: confusion in regard to the appearance of reality, and confusion in regard to the nature of reality.
* Explanations of removal are not firmly set, varying depending on which text is used.


## 1.4 Antidotes To The Hindrances

* Removing afflictive hindrances leads to mental liberation.
* Removing cognitive hindrances leads to wisdom liberation.

## 1.4.1 The contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized

* Mental liberation at the level of conventional truth comes from removing afflictions.
* Wisdom liberation at the level of ultimate truth comes from removing nescience.

## 1.4.2 Distinguishing The Broadly And Narrowly Applied Antidotes

* Removing afflictive hindrances only removes attached defiled mental states, leading to conventional truth liberation.
* Removing cognitive hindrances removes both entrenchment of nescience and coarse nescience, leading to liberation at both levels of truth. 



## 2 Second Level

* Four parts: defining the hindrances, explanation of terminology, stages of elimination, antidotes to the hindrances.

## 2.1 Defining The Hindrances

* Five entrenchments binding at the nature level constitute afflictive hindrances.
* Nescience in regard to phenomena constitutes cognitive hindrances.
* This is supported by scriptures like the *Nirvāṇa Sutra*.

## 2.2 Explanation Of Terminology

* Afflictive hindrances cause distress and are called so because they bring about saṃsāra.
* Cognitive hindrances obscure understanding of Buddha's lineage.

## 2.3 Stages Of Elimination

* Three distinctions in stages: mundane/transmundane, application of effort/effortlessness, causes/effects.

### 2.3.1 Distinction between mundane and transmundane

* Two connotations within this distinction:
    * Contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized (e.g., abandoning appearances vs. aligning with dharma realm).
    * Mutual defining of superior and inferior (e.g., bodhisattvas at lower grounds only remove afflictive hindrances, while those above remove both).

### 2.3.2 Distinction between application of effort and effortlessness

* Two connotations within this distinction:
    * Contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized (e.g., removing afflictive hindrances at lower grounds vs. extirpating cognitive hindrances at higher grounds).
    * Mutual defining of superior and inferior (e.g., removing only afflictive hindrances below the eighth ground, while removing both above).

### 2.3.3 Distinction between causes and effects

* Two connotations within this distinction:
    * Contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized (e.g., eliminating afflictive hindrances up to the adamantine stage vs. removing cognitive hindrances at Buddhahood).
    * Mutual defining of superior and inferior (e.g., removing only afflictive hindrances below the adamantine stage, while removing both at Buddhahood).

## 2.4 Antidotes To The Hindrances

* Removing afflictive hindrances leads to mental liberation.
* Removing cognitive hindrances leads to wisdom liberation.
* Two types of mental liberation: conventional and ultimate.
* Wisdom liberation is attained through illumination of understanding mundane phenomena.

## 3 Third Level

* Four parts: defining characteristics, explanation of terminology, stages of elimination, antidotes applied to specific hindrances.

### 3.1 Defining the characteristics of the hindrances


* Five entrenchments binding at nature level and nescience in regard to phenomena constitute afflictive hindrances.
* Discriminating cognition is regarded as the cognitive hindrance.
* This is supported by scriptures like the *Śrīmālādevīsūtra*, *Ratnagotravibhāga*, Laṅkâvatāra-*sūtra*, and Nāgârjuna's teachings.

## 3.2 Explanation Of Terminology

* Binding at the level of the natures of the five entrenchments as well as the essence of nescience in regard to phenomena are all *dharma*s of delusion and travail, they are called afflictions.
* Since discriminating cognition obstructs reality, it is called cognitive hindrance. 


## 3.3 Levels Of Elimination

* There are two levels of elimination: discrimination between being prior to the grounds or in the grounds and discrimination of mundane and transmundane directly attained in the grounds.

### 3.3.1 Comparison of elimination prior to the grounds and in the grounds
* At the stages of understanding and practice and prior, the appearances of increase are cultivated. Hence one eliminates the cognitive hindrances.
* From the first ground and above the appearances of abandonment are cultivated, and hence one removes the cognitive hindrances.

### 3.3.1.1 The contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized
* At the stages of understanding and practice and prior, the appearances of increase are cultivated. Hence one eliminates the cognitive hindrances. From the first ground and above the appearances of abandonment are cultivated, hence one removes the cognitive hindrances.

### 3.3.1.2 Mutual Defining Of Superior And Inferior
* Before the grounds, bodhisattvas only eliminate afflictions. From the first ground and above they counteract both kinds of hindrances extensively, such that both are removed.

### 3.3.2 Discrimination between mundane and transmundane in the grounds
* The first, second, and third grounds are called mundane. The fourth ground and above are called transmundane.

### 3.3.2.1 The contrast between what is de-emphasized and what is emphasized

#### 3.3.2.1.1 Afflictive Hindrances
* The mundane practices from the third ground and below remove the afflictive hindrances. The supramundane authentic wisdom operating in the fourth ground and above removes the cognitive hindrances.

#### 3.3.2.1.2 Cognitive Hindrances
* There are three kinds of cognitive hindrances: hindrance of knowing, hindrance of essence, and hindrance due to notions of correction.

##### 3.3.2.1.2.1 Hindrance Of Knowing
* The first is the hindrance of knowing, which means the mental states of [attachment to] emptiness and existence.

##### 3.3.2.1.2.2 Hindrance Of Essence
* The second is the hindrance of essence, which means the essence of constructed spiritual cognition.

##### 3.3.2.1.2.3 Hindrance Due To Notions Of Correction
* The third is the [hindrance due to] notions of correction.

#### 3.3.2.1.3 Removal of the three kinds of cognitive hindrances

##### 3.3.2.1.3.1 Removal of the hindrance of knowing
* Starting from the fourth ground, continuing up to the seventh ground, the hindrance of knowing is eliminated. Entering into the eighth ground, one removes the hindrance of essence. From the eighth ground up to the ground of the Tathāgata, one removes the hindrance of the notion of correction.



## 3.3.2.1.3.2 Removal Of The Hindrance Of Essence

* While in the prior seventh ground, even though one observes the thusness of *dharmas*, this is still a mental state of "having seen", and is to be regarded as a subjective observation.

* It is based on this seeing that the mind differs from thusness, and one is unable to exercise the vast, effortless immovability that places one into the eighth ground.
* In breaking this kind of obstruction, one penetratingly observes that outside of thusness, there is originally no mind, and that outside of the mind, there is no thusness.

* With subjective and objective already gone, they vanish into the same single mark. This is the meaning of directly abandoning the exertion of discrimination.
* Since one abandons this exertion, activity is the same as thusness, and the resultant vast immovability is called entry into the eighth ground. 


## 3.3.2.1.3.3 Removal of the hindrance due to the notion of correction

* Even though one has been removing hindrances of essence up to the level of the eighth ground, the notion of correction still lingers.
* Because discrimination subsides, the real appears directly before one. The *dharma* of enlightenment is only real; from beginning to end it lacks falsity. With this vision of the real there is no power in the false, and therefore one is able to cause the false to be corrected.

* The former does not produce the latter, and the latter does not give rise to the former. In this, they are completely extinguished. 


## 3.3.2.2 Mutual Defining Of Superior And Inferior

* In the first, second, and third grounds one overcomes the weaker hindrances, only eliminating the afflictions.
* From the fourth ground and above one deeply and widely treats the two hindrances, removing both of them. Comprehensively speaking, you should know that from the first ground up to the Buddha ground both hindrances are removed together in every thought-moment.

* Discriminating cognition gradually clarifies, eliminating the afflictive hindrances. Real *dharmas* gradually manifest, extinguishing the cognitive hindrances. Correction and elimination occur like this. 


## 3.3.3 Application Of Antidotes

* From this perspective, when one eliminates the afflictive hindrances, both kinds of liberation arise together. When one removes the cognitive hindrances, both kinds of liberation appear together.
* The two hindrances as introduced in the AMF are the same as those of the second level of interpretation provided here. i.e., the manifest aspects of the five entrenchments (the four entrenchments, including their active manifestations) are equivalent to the afflictive hindrances, and nescience, including its active manifestations, is equivalent to the cognitive hindrances.
* Therefore in this treatise, the nescience entrenchments alone are regarded as the cognitive hindrances, while the myriad troubles that defile the mind are the afflictive hindrances.

## On the Notion of Kaidaoyi (**Avakāśadānāśraya*) as Discussed in Xuanzang's *Cheng weishi lun*1 Junjie Chu

* The paper examines the meaning of "kaidaoyi" (開導依), a term used by Xuanzang in his *Cheng weishi lun*, which is a commentary on Vasubandhu's *Triṃśikākārikā*.
* It analyzes the two elements of the term, *kaidao* and yi, exploring their possible origins in Indian Abhidharma and Yogācāra sources. 
* The paper aims to reconstruct the original Sanskrit forms of these terms.
* It discusses the controversy surrounding three different interpretations of "kaidaoyi" presented by Xuanzang.
* The study sheds light on the Buddhist epistemological tradition's discussion about the relationship between two kinds of awareness in a thought series.

## 272 Chu 2 Kaidao = Avakāśadāna

* Kuiji seems to confuse *krānta* with *krama*, which is usually translated as *cidi*. He then confuses *cidi* with the same characters in the compound *cidiyuan*, another standard translation of *samanantarapratyaya*.
* The exact meaning of *kaidaoyi* is not explicitly explained in CWSL, but Kuiji offers a comprehensive explanation in his commentary.

## 2.1 In CWSL

* Kuiji explains the term *kaidaoyi* as "making way" and "leading to arise."
* He provides a phonetic transcription of the Sanskrit form, *jielanduo*, which La Vallée Poussin suggests can be reconstructed as *krānta*.
* Kuiji differentiates *krāntapratyaya* from *samanantarapratyaya*, arguing that *cidiyuan* should only be used to translate the former.

## 2.2 The Function of Kaidaoyi

* The idea expressed by *kaidaoyi* - "making way and leading to arise" - is common in Abhidharma tradition.
* The similar-immediate condition is often described as performing this function with respect to thought and thought concomitants.

## 2.3 Basis of Awareness

* In Buddhist philosophical systems, the awareness that passed away in the antecedent moment is called "mind" (*manas*).
* This principle is based on the idea that sensory awareness has two kinds of bases: material sense faculties and mental faculty.
* The mind that ceased to exist in the immediately antecedent moment serves as the basis for the present awareness.

## 2.4 Similar-Immediate Condition

* This principle is clearly stated in *Yogācārabhūmi*: factors of thought and thought concomitants from which other such factors arise are called "the similar-immediate condition."
* The six awarenesses that are the similar-immediate condition of other six awarenesses are mind, designated as "mind" (*manas*), "mental sphere" (*manaāyatana*), and "mental element" (*manodhātu*).

## 2.5 Mind in Yogacara

* Asaṅga explains two aspects of the meaning of "mind" (*manas*):
    * It refers to the thinking faculty, shared by Sarvāstivāda and Sautrāntika.
    * It also refers to the defiled mind (kliṣṭamanas*), unique to Yogācāra.




## # Similar-Immediate Condition

* Xuanzang's translation of a passage about similar-immediate condition differs from Tibetan and Paramārtha's translations.
* Xuanzang specifies it as "mental awareness", while others are more general.
* This difference might be influenced by Vasubandhu's interpretation.

## # Similar-Immediate Condition and Giving Way

* In Sarvāstivāda tradition, similar-immediate condition is linked with the function of "giving way".
* Saṅghabhadra emphasizes that only a present factor can perform this function.
* A factor has the power to give way only when it's already produced and ceased to exist.

## # Temporal Relationships between Conditions and Conditioned Factors

* The *Abhidharmakośa* (AK) discusses temporal relationships between conditions and conditioned factors.
* It states that different types of causes perform their activities on factors in different temporal states.
* The similar-immediate condition performs its activity on "arising" or "future" factors because it gives way to them.

## # Supporting Cause (*Parigrahahetu*)

* In the *Bodhisattvabhūmi*, only thought and thought concomitants have both a similar-immediate condition and a condition *qua* object-support.
* This is because they are supported by their predecessors which give way to them.
* The term *parigrahahetu* encompasses all secondary causes, apart from the main cause (seed).

## #  *Parigrahahetu* in the *Maulī bhūmi* Section

* In the *Maulī bhūmi*, *parigrahahetu* is explained as "conditions in the manner that earth and rain are conditions for the appearance of a sprout".
* It is connected with "the basis of cause that passed away contiguously" and "the basis of cause which is the object-field, sense faculty, action, human effort, and view of reality".

## 3 Kaidaoyi = *Avakāśadānāśraya*

### 3.1 With regard to the causes of the arising of thought and thought concomitants...

* The Yogācāra system introduces terms with "basis" (*āśraya*) at the end, although terms with "condition" (*pratyaya*) are still used.
* "Basis" is preferred because awareness needs a substratum to function as a condition.
* This concept relates to the idea of *ālayavijñāna*, the basis of personal existence.

### 3.2 From the perspective of the structure of the text...

* A discussion in CWSL about the basis of thought seems out of place.
* It is adapted from YBh, which explains the relationship between "basis" and "condition".
* Based on various factors (seed, passed away factor, object), different types of conditions are designated.

### 3.3 In standard Yogācāra texts...

* Three bases are mentioned: *bījāśraya* ("basis in the sense of seed"), *sahabhūr āśrayaḥ* ("co-existent basis") and *samanantara āśrayaḥ* ("similar-immediate basis").
* These correspond to the *ālayavijñāna*, sense faculties, and mind respectively.

### 3.4 Thus far, we can conclude that *kaidaoyi*...

* Refers to a preceding awareness called "mind" (*manas*) which gives way to subsequent awareness.
* This idea is old and found in Abhidharma tradition.
* *Avakāśadānāśraya*, "basis that gives way," seems to be the original form of *kaidaoyi*.

### 3.5 With regard to the difference between *avakāśadānāśraya*...

* It is easily confused with *samanantarapratyaya*, "similar-immediate condition".
* Dharmapāla states that a basis that gives way must be: (1) have an object support, (2) be the principal thought, and (3) have the function of similar-immediate condition.
* Kuiji confirms this distinction, stating that all bases that give way are similar-immediate conditions, but not all similar-immediate conditions are bases that give way.

### 3.6 The difference between the terms "basis that gives way" and "similar-immediate condition"...


* "Basis that gives way" indicates function while "similar-immediate condition" indicates temporal property.
* "Basis" (*āśraya*) has a broader meaning than "condition" (*pratyaya*).

# 4 Three Interpretations Of *Avakāśadānāśraya

* There are three divergent opinions about the nature and function of the *avakāśa-*dānāśraya*, "basis that gives way", reflecting different understandings of the relationship between two awarenesses in a thought series.
* These opinions are attributed to groups headed by Nanda, Sthiramati, and Dharmapāla.

# 4.2 The First Opinion: Nanda *et al*.

* The five sensory awarenesses cannot continue from one moment to the next as the same type or different types because they arise through the projecting force of the sixth awareness (mental awareness).
* Therefore, they take exclusively the sixth awareness as their basis that gives way.
* The sixth awareness can continue as the same kind and arises through the projecting force of the five sensory awarenesses, so it takes all six types of awareness in the previous moment as its basis.
* The seventh and eighth awarenesses maintain continuity and do not arise from other awarenesses, so they take only themselves as their basis that gives way.

# 4.3 The Second Opinion: Sthiramati *et al*.

* This opinion criticizes Nanda's position, arguing that sensory awareness can be continuous, especially for those with supernatural powers who can effortlessly grasp objects through any sense faculty.
* Sensory awareness is accompanied by mental awareness and only becomes non-continuous in special cases where it grasps objects spontaneously or the object is not distinctive.

# 4.5 The Conclusion of Sthiramati *et al*.

* The five types of sensory awareness take all six awarenesses in the antecedent moment as their basis that gives way because they are continuous and arise through the projecting force of mental awareness.
* The sixth awareness takes either its own kind or the seventh and eighth awarenesses as its basis when it arises in thought-free states. 




# Sthiramati's Opinion

* Sensory awareness and mental awareness exist in tandem in both antecedent and subsequent moments.
* Both types of awareness serve as a basis for their successors.
* Sensory awareness, being an extension of the same kind of awareness in the antecedent moment, is accompanied by mental awareness upon its arising.

# Dharmapāla's Refutation

* Sthiramati's theory is unreasonable because simultaneous awarenesses cannot be the basis that gives way for one another.
* Different kinds of awareness occur simultaneously and their number is indeterminate.
* Matter cannot be a similar-immediate condition as it would make the number of antecedent awarenesses unequal to subsequent ones.

# Dharmapāla's Position

* Each of the eight kinds of awareness has only its own kind as its basis that gives way.
* Mental awareness cannot be caused by sensory awareness, or vice versa.
* This conforms to scriptural tradition and reasoning because awarenesses of the same kind cannot occur simultaneously.

# Comparison of Sthiramati and Dharmapāla

* Both accept the simultaneous arising of multiple kinds of awareness.
* Dharmapāla disagrees with Sthiramati's acceptance that five types of awareness also take mental awareness as their similar-immediate condition.
* Sthiramati emphasizes the continuity of thought, allowing the five awarenesses to maintain continuity under the condition that they are accompanied by mental awareness.

# Dharmapāla on Dignāga's ĀP

* Realistic systems distinguish between the object of sensory awareness (real) and mental awareness (unreal).
* Dharmapāla argues against this distinction, pointing out that mental awareness arises through the projecting force of sensory awareness.
* He proposes a solution where mental awareness shares the same object as sensory awareness, avoiding the problem of blindness or deafness if they were to perceive objects independently.

# Solutions to the Problem of Object Perception

* Dharmakīrti's solution: Mental awareness arises from sensory awareness as its immediate condition and grasps a different object.
* This approach avoids the unwanted consequence that a blind man would also perceive the object.

## 5 Conclusion

* The Chinese term *kaidaoyi* translates to the Sanskrit word *avakāśadānāśraya*, meaning "basis that gives way".
* It refers to the awareness from the previous moment that allows for the arising of subsequent awareness.
* Xuanzang's CWSL uses *kaidaoyi* in discussing the relationship between mental and sensory awareness.

* *Kaidaoyi* is not a translation of *krāntāśraya*, as suggested by Kuiji's phonetic transcription.
* Three interpretations exist regarding the function and nature of *avakāśadānāśraya*:

    * Nanda et al.: Sensory awareness arises anew each moment depending on mental awareness, while mental awareness relies on both sensory and previous mental awareness.
    * Sthiramati et al.: Sensory awareness continues through time, accompanied by mental awareness, arising simultaneously.
    * Dharmapāla et al.: Each type of awareness only depends on its own kind from the previous moment.

* The second and third interpretations agree on the simultaneous arising of different types of awareness.
* They differ in whether sensory awareness can rely on mental awareness as a basis.
* Dharmapāla still acknowledges simultaneous arising, with mental awareness potentially sharing the same object as sensory awareness.

# Yogācāra Critiques Of The Two Truths

* Zhihua Yao introduces the concept of "two truths" in Madhyamaka Buddhism and its perceived difficulty.
* He highlights a key difference between Yogācāra and Madhyamaka as identified by Yijing: Yogācāra emphasizes the existence of ultimate truth but not conventional truth, while Madhyamaka asserts the opposite.
* The debate between these schools centers around the "two truths" and the "three natures," with Bhāviveka (Madhyamaka) criticizing Yogācāra's doctrines.

#  Early Yogācāra Critiques of the Two Truths

* Lusthaus's study focuses on Asaṅga and Maitreyanātha, finding their acceptance of "two truths" within a broader framework of multiple truth paradigms.
* Yao questions whether early Yogācāras truly accepted the Madhyamaka concept of "two truths" without criticism.




## 2 Against Nihilism

* Some people misunderstand the meaning of Mahāyāna sūtras about emptiness.
* They develop false concepts and use logic to conclude that reality is nothing but designation (prajñaptimātra).
* This view denies both designation and reality, making it a form of nihilism.
* The Yogācāra school criticizes this view because they believe in the existence of real things (*vastu*) as the basis for designations.

## 3 The Nihilists'S Two Truths

* This section focuses on the Madhyamaka theory of two truths, which states that all things exist conventionally but nothing exists ultimately.
* The Yogācāra argues that this view leads to nihilism because if nothing exists ultimately, then there can be no designations.
* They question whether linguistic expressions and conventions arise from a causal relation or are merely words.
* If they arise from a causal relation, then they must have an identity or intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*), contradicting the Madhyamaka view of emptiness.

* If they are merely words, then there is no real thing to serve as their basis, again contradicting the Madhyamaka view.
* The Yogācāra also questions whether perversion (the cause of our attachment to notions of self and permanence) is existent or nonexistent.
* If it's existent, then all causally-based *dharma*s are also existent, contradicting the Madhyamaka view of emptiness.

* If it's nonexistent, then it cannot be the reason why knowables are devoid of intrinsic nature.

## # Epistemological Consideration

* The Yogācāra seems to hold that nonexistents cannot be knowable.
* This position is based on the analogy of the horn of a rabbit, which is something that absolutely does not exist and therefore cannot be apprehended.
* However, this contradicts other Yogācāra arguments that claim it is possible to cognize nonexistent objects.

## # The Two Truths And The Three Natures

* Vasubandhu's recension of the *Yogācārabhūmi* offers a slightly clearer explanation of the debate between the Yogācāra and Mādhyamikas regarding the existence of perversion.
* Vasubandhu argues that designations, even if they exist conventionally, do not refer to anything that actually exists.
* He presents a sophisticated argument for why both the ultimate truth and the conventional truth cannot be definitively said to exist or not exist.

* The Yogācāra introduce the concept of the dependent nature to address the limitations of the Madhyamaka theory of two truths.

* This dependent nature allows for a more robust worldview that avoids nihilism while acknowledging the illusory nature of conventional reality.
* Kenshū, a Japanese commentator on the *Buddhadhātuśāstra*, criticizes the Madhyamaka theory for implying an illusory worldview based on the imagined nature.

* The Yogācāra view distinguishes between the imagined nature (nonexistent) and the dependent nature (existent).

* Yijing characterizes the Yogācāra view as stating that what pertains to the ultimate level exists, but what pertains to the conventional level does not exist.
* The perfected nature, roughly equivalent to the ultimate truth, is defined as the dependent nature devoid of the imagined nature.

* While both Yogācāra and Mādhyamikas agree on the nonexistence of self and *dharma*s, they differ in their understanding of emptiness.

* The Yogācāra view "the emptiness of self and *dharma*s" as something existent, offering a positive characterization of ultimate reality.
* This contrasts with the Madhyamaka view, which sees the ultimate truth as purely negative and nonexistent.

# What is the Right Understanding of Emptiness?

* The Yogācāra school defines emptiness as the absence of something (y) in a particular place (x), while acknowledging that other things still exist in that place.
* This definition aligns with ordinary language usage, where "empty" means lacking something specific but not nonexistent altogether.
* The Yogācāra view contrasts with the Mādhyamika interpretation, which emphasizes the emptiness of all phenomena, including self and dharmas.

# Another Classical Definition of Emptiness

* The *Madhyāntavibhāga*, attributed to Maitreyanātha, defines emptiness as the nonexistence of subject-object duality and the existence of that nonexistence.
* This definition highlights the Yogācāra's epistemological focus on consciousness (*vijñāna*) and thusness (*tathatā*) as fundamental realities.

# The Madhyamaka and Yogācāra Senses of Emptiness

* Tibetan scholars categorized emptiness into "self-emptiness" (Madhyamaka) and "other-emptiness" (Yogācāra).
* While the Madhyamaka view emphasizes the emptiness of things themselves, the Yogācāra view focuses on the emptiness of things in relation to other things.

# A Holistic Worldview

* Vasubandhu's remarks suggest a rejection of dualistic thinking that separates existence from nonexistence.
* Asaṅga, in his commentary on Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā*, criticizes the Madhyamaka concept of two truths as introducing a duality into reality.
* Both Vasubandhu and Asaṅga advocate for a holistic worldview that transcends dualistic distinctions. 




## 7 Conclusion

* The Madhyamaka paradigm of two truths contributed to an illusory worldview.
* Yogācāra theory aimed to improve this by restoring a more holistic worldview.
* This study criticizes the Madhyamaka version of two truths based on the Yogācāra theory of three natures.
* It aims to correct misconceptions about the Buddhist approach to reality among contemporary scholars influenced by Madhyamaka.

## Philosophical Aspects of Sixth-Century Chinese Buddhist Debates on "Mind and Consciousness"

* Sixth-century Chinese Buddhist treatises often discuss the nature, potential, and functioning of "mind and consciousness" (*xinshi* 心識).
* They emphasize that realizing truth and Buddha wisdom is inseparable from experiencing the delusive world.
* The term "*inseparability* of truth and falsehood" signifies this general issue in Chinese Mahāyāna thought.
* Different schools interpret this inseparability differently: Tiantai masters see ignorance and the true nature of *dharma*(s) as indivisible; Huayan masters combine the "conjunction of truth and falsehood" with the doctrine of the two *dharma* gates.
* Yogācāra views truth and falsehood through the lens of the three natures, while Madhyamaka scriptures discuss the differentiation between "two truths."

* Inseparability correlates with the Mahāyāna insight that falsehood is a heuristic principle leading to liberation from suffering.
* Falsehood can be deceptive but also discloses the path to true liberation.
* Various Buddhist terms accentuate different connotations of falsehood, such as inversion (*diandao*), deceptive discrimination (*xuwang fenbie*), and illusory existence (*huanyou*).

* This article analyzes the philosophical implications of "inseparability of truth and falsehood" from Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, and Tathāgatagarbha perspectives.
* It aims to show that ontological discussions are often intertwined with soteriological concerns about suspending apodictic claims about reality.

* The next sections discuss sources from the Madhyamaka, Tathāgatagarbha, and Yogācāra traditions on truth and falsehood.
* A final section outlines the positions of Huiyuan (Dilun) and Zhiyi (Tiantai).

## 2 Truth And Falsehood According To The Madhyamaka View In The Zhong Lun4

* Mahāyāna Buddhism focuses on mind's role in suffering and liberation.
* Unlike Yogācāra and Tathāgatagarbha, Mādhyamika prioritizes understanding emptiness over mind.
* Emptiness is fundamental to interdependent arising, the basis of all phenomena.

##  The Conventional Truth

* Our perceptions shape how we see things, making them compound phenomena built on interrelationships.
* The *Zhong lun* uses the example of cause and effect to illustrate interdependence.
* Nothing has an intrinsic, independent nature due to emptiness sustaining interdependent arising.
* This unreality doesn't mean non-existence, but rather a lack of inherent existence.

##  Truth and Falsehood

* Conventional truth is provisional and limited, ultimately pointing towards ultimate truth.
* It can be instructive, leading us towards understanding emptiness, even though it is fundamentally false.
* Recognizing the limitations of conventional truth is crucial for its deconstruction and revealing its falsehood.
* The *Zhong lun* uses refutation to deconstruct heretical views and Abhidharma concepts, clarifying their limited validity.

##  Correlative Opposites

* Terms like "suffering" and "liberation" are correlative opposites, defined by mutual negation and emptiness.
* Neither part of these pairs can exist independently, highlighting the illusory nature of conventional distinctions.




# Names and Reality

* Sengzhao stated that names do not align with reality.
* Things designated by names are not real.
* This unreality applies to the term "emptiness" as well.
* True emptiness is inexpressible, inconceivable, and irreducible.

# The Path to Liberation

* To achieve liberation from suffering, we must abandon clinging to conventional falsehoods, including the term "emptiness."
* We need to realize ultimate true emptiness within our ordinary world.
* This involves dissociating our understanding from deceptive influences and reifications inherent in language.

# Emptiness as a Provisional Name

* Despite its problems, Mādhyamikas use the term "emptiness" to explain liberation.
* They acknowledge that this term can be deceptive if taken literally.
* "Emptiness" is considered a provisional/false name (*jiaming*) that can guide us towards ultimate truth.

# Ontological Indeterminacy

* The emptiness of inherent existence implies ontological indeterminacy, expressed as the "middle way" (*zhongdao*).
* This middle way denies both real existence and complete nonexistence of things rooted in interdependence.
* Things in the conventional realm lack invariant or definite identity (*juedingxiang*), indicating their ontic indeterminacy.

# Falsehood as Instructive

* Falsehood can be deceptive, enticing us to cling to unreal things.
* However, revealed falsehood, like the term "emptiness," can be instructive by prompting us to question our understanding and realize ultimate truth.
* The *Zhong lun* emphasizes relying on the conventional to achieve the ultimate: revealing conventional falsehood to understand ultimate truth.

# Two Truths

* Differentiating between the two truths (conventional and ultimate) is crucial to avoid clinging to reifications arising from language.
* This differentiation involves recognizing the emptiness and falsehood of the conventional while maintaining awareness of its utility.
* This paradoxical approach realizes inseparability, as separating truth and falsehood leads to further reifications.

# Dialetheism vs. Pragmatism

* While some interpretations (like dialetheism) suggest inconsistent reality due to the realms of conventional and ultimate, this contradicts true emptiness.
* The Chinese *Zhong lun* emphasizes a pragmatic approach where differentiating between truths reveals the profundity of the Buddha-*dharma* and highlights the inseparability of truth and falsehood in our understanding.

## 3 Reality And Falsehood According To Tathāgatagarbha Doctrine

* Emptiness sustains interdependent arising while denying inherent existence of things.
* Understanding emptiness involves both its sustaining and nullifying aspects.
* The *Zhong lun* focuses on the nullifying aspect, while texts influenced by t*athāgatagarbha* doctrine emphasize the sustaining aspect.
* T*athāgatagarbha* doctrine incorporates elements from Yogācāra and Madhyamaka but has distinct characteristics.

##  
* Huayan Buddhists stress the inseparability of illusory existence and true emptiness.
* Things arise interdependently and are ever-changing, thus illusorily existent.
* True emptiness sustains this unreality and is inexhaustible.

* According to t*athāgatagarbha* doctrine, there is an indestructible potential for buddhahood in every sentient being.
* This potential persists because our unreal world is seen as inverse manifestations of buddhahood.

* Reality in the proper sense is "ultimate emptiness" devoid of both falsehood and reality.
* Terms like reality or emptiness must be used ambiguously to reveal their inseparability from falsehood.

##  
* The Śrīmālādevī-s*ūtra* discusses "birth/life and death" in relation to inconceivable and indestructible reality (t*athāgatagarbha*).
* Our existence seems like a constant alternation of arising and ceasing, but this is a false construction.

* Mahāyāna scriptures emphasize that interdependent arising entails continuity.
* Impermanence must be faced to achieve liberation from suffering.
* Continuity should not be confused with duration; temporality is devoid of marks qualifying time.

##  
* The *Zhong lun* and *Da zhi du lun* highlight two types of inversions: mistaking the unreal for real, and mistaking the real for unreal.
* These inversions relate to understanding emptiness: "emptiness" as nullification and "non-emptiness" as sustenance.

* The Mahāparinirvāṇa-s*ūtra* warns against clinging to either impermanence or permanence views.
* The right view avoids both types of inversion, realizing the dynamics of "the wisdom of the supreme meaning of emptiness".

* The Śrīmālādevī-s*ūtra* mentions "empty t*athāgatagarbha*" and "non-empty t*athāgatagarbha*", correlating with "emptiness in accordance with reality" and "non-emptiness in accordance with reality" in the *Awakening of Faith*.

* Emptiness, understood as emptiness of false views, reflects an *a posteriori* viewpoint.
* T*athāgatagarbha*, emptied from inversions, reveals its unaffected, invariable reality (non-emptiness).

* Emptying inversions and seeing the reality of t*athāgatagarbha* are coextensive.
* The chapter "Inversion and Reality" in the Śrīmālādevī-s*ūtra* explains that birth/life and death are grounded on t*athāgatagarbha*.

## indriyāṇ*i) already apprehending [the sensory realms] pass out of existence, and subsequently, sense faculties that have not [yet] apprehended arise; this is called birth/life and death

* Birth/life and death are worldly terms. 
* Death means the passing away of sense faculties.
* Birth/life implies the arising of new sense faculties.
* In reality, there is no birth/life and death in the realm of tathāgatagarbha*.

## Tathāgatagarbha is beyond the mark of [false] construction(s); tathā*gatagarbha* constantly endures and never changes; therefore, tathā*gatagarbha* grounds, sustains, and sets up

* Tathāgatagarbha* is beyond worldly constructions.
* It is constant and unchanging.
* It grounds, sustains, and sets up all phenomena.

## The second phrase outlines the essentials of this *dharma* of the ground

* Due to its true suchness, permanence, and oneness, it is called "not leaving".
* As no falsehood can defile it, it is called "not interrupting".
* As it is non-constructed, it is called "not separating".
* It is homogeneous and therefore called "not differing".
* It is incomprehensible to our senses, and thus is called "inconceivable Buddha-*dharma*".

## When we understand t*athāgatagarbha* as the ground of both the defiled and the pure mode, it also means that those opposites are not essentially different

* Tathāgatagarbha* sustains both defiled and pure modes.
* These modes are not truly different in nature.
* They cannot be viewed as identical either.

## Consequently, for Huiyuan, who explains that the two stand in a mutual relation of "neither identity nor difference", such differentiation does not constitute a real duality, nor does their inseparability imply any sense of monism

* Differentiation and inseparability are both aspects of tathāgatagarbha*.
* They do not represent a dualistic or monistic position.
* This understanding is essential for realizing the inconceivability of Buddha-*dharma*.





# The Nature of Pure Mind

* According to Fazang, our perception of three-dimensional objects in a painting arises from falsely separating these figures from the even surface of the wall.
* Similarly, our defiled mind, with its illusory world, is grounded upon an intrinsically clear and pure mind devoid of those apparent entities.

# Tathāgatagarbha vs. Madhyamaka

* Both tathāgatagarbha and Madhyamaka teachings are based on the inseparability of reality/truth and falsehood.
* They differ in their approach: Madhyamaka emphasizes unveiling falsehood as falsehood, while tathāgatagarbha focuses on exposing reality as reality.
* This difference likely reflects different epistemic conditions for realizing liberation.

# The Origin of Delusion

* If pure mind is the only reality, why does it fall into a defiled mode and create illusory worlds?
* The *Awakening of Faith* explains that pure mind, exposed to ignorance and delusions, transforms into ālaya-consciousness, which manifests arising and cessation.

# Awakening

* The tathāgatagarbha doctrine views questions about beginning and ending as symptomatic of delusion.
* Initial awakening (*shijue*) arises from this conceptual limit, leading to ultimate awakening (*bijing jue*), the realization of original awakening (*benjue*).

# Truth and Falsehood in Yogācāra

* The *Compendium of the Great Vehicle* discusses truth and falsehood through the lens of ālaya-consciousness.
* Ālaya-consciousness is a subtle level of consciousness that stores impressions and habitual forces, shaping our perception and experience.

# The Function of Ālaya-Consciousness

* Ālaya-consciousness gives rise to both our sensory capacities and the world of external objects.
* It is also influenced by the fruition of those senses, creating a circular system of self-perpetuating unreality.
* This model explains the continuous cycle of arising and ceasing, as well as the perpetuation of saṃsāra.

# The Defiled World and the False Self

* The external world perceived by our senses is illusory and deceptive because its unreality evades our awareness.
* Things are mistaken for real entities belonging to an independent world, obscuring the unreality of the sensory realm.
* Not only are external objects illusory, but also the perceiving subject, the "self," which sustains our sensory functioning.

# Defiled Intentionality and the Three Levels of Mind

* The false self is referred to as "defiled intentionality" (*ranwuyi*), clinging to an illusive sense of self.
* This concept arises from the *ālaya*-consciousness, the ground of our defiled experience.
* Yogācāra scriptures describe mind and consciousness in three levels: 1) *xin* (mind), receptive to impressions; 2) *yi* (intentionality), constructing selfhood and selfishness; and 3) *shi* (sensory functioning).

# The Nature of Reality

* Both perceived objects and the perceiving subject are illusory projections arising from the *ālaya*-consciousness.
* Our experienced world amounts to "mere consciousness" or "mere imagination," a projection of self-perpetuating unreality.

# Consciousness as Result of Differing Maturation

* *Ālaya*-consciousness is also called "consciousness as result of differing maturation," storing seeds of both positive and negative karma.
* This receptive capacity is neutral and unobstructive to the path of liberation, allowing for transformation.
* The neutrality of *ālaya*-consciousness allows for the possibility of extinguishing defilements and achieving enlightenment.

# Transformation through Listening to the Dharma

* Defiled consciousness can be transformed into true wisdom by increasing pure seeds through "habitual forces of correct listening" to the Buddha's teachings.
* Pure seeds reside in *ālaya*-consciousness without merging with it, gradually impeding the collection of defiled seeds.
* This process culminates in "transforming the ground," replacing defiled seeds with pure ones, leading to a realm sustained by wisdom.

# The Ground of What is Known

* *Ālaya*-consciousness serves as the "ground of what is known" (*suozhiyi*), the foundation for both defiled and purified consciousness.
* While the nature of this ground doesn't fundamentally change, its qualification by seeds determines whether it manifests as defilement or wisdom.
* The transformation of the ground does not necessarily imply the cessation of *ālaya*-consciousness, but rather a shift in its content.

# The Relationship Between Truth and Falsehood

*  The Yogācāra school views reality/truth and falsehood as a duality, existing in separate realms that don't interpenetrate.
*  Sentient beings exist within a cycle of self-perpetuating unreality but have the potential for both truth and falsehood.
* The "three natures" doctrine attempts to explain this potential.

# The Three Natures

* The three natures are:
    * "Nature of other-dependent arising": Things appear as they do due to unreal discrimination, stemming from the *ālaya*-consciousness.
    * "Nature of attachments to what is thoroughly imaginary": This nature arises when the unreality of things is mistaken for reality.
    * "Nature of perfected reality": This is the realization of the true, pure nature of things through understanding their emptiness.

# The Interplay of the Three Natures

* These three natures are distinct yet inseparable.
* The "nature of other-dependent arising" itself can be defiled or undefiled depending on how it manifests.
* Sentient beings exist in a world of unreal appearances, with the potential for both truth and falsehood.




## 5 Truth/Reality And Falsehood In The Chinese Debates On Mind The Viewpoint Of Huiyuan

* This section discusses the concept of mind according to Huiyuan, a third generation Dilun master; and Zhiyi, the principal founder of the Tiantai school, who criticized the Dilun viewpoint. 
* Several sources indicate that the Dilun masters split into two groups, called the "Southern" and "Northern Way", and their differences probably had to do with differing interpretations regarding the concept of "*ālaya*-consciousness".

* According to Mou Zongsan, this controversial question results from the ambiguous nature of occasional remarks about the meaning of *ālaya*-consciousness in the *Daśabhūmika-sūtra-*śāstra*.
* In Buddhist debates on "mind and consciousness" in sixth-century China, the Dilun and the Shelun masters agreed in assuming that the mind was fundamentally pure.

* The *Awakening of Faith* combines the doctrine of the fundamental purity of mind with the Yogācāra doctrine of ālaya-consciousness.
* Huiyuan seems to be partly influenced by the *Awakening of Faith*, but when he explicates his concept of mind and consciousness in his famous Treatise on the Meaning of the Great Vehicle (*Dasheng yi zhang* 大乘義章), he also quotes from and refers to the *Compendium*.

* Though he adopts and modifies the three-level scheme of mind and consciousness, which is variously expounded in the *Awakening of Faith* and the *Compendium*, his interpretation of *ālaya*-consciousness obviously follows the viewpoint of the Southern Way, identifying it with pure mind and t*athāgatagarbha*.

* Huiyuan emphasizes the significance of the "inseparability of truth/reality and falsehood".
* Although he uses many technical expressions from the Yogācāra tradition, his understanding obviously differs from that tradition, and essentially represents the tathā*gatagarbha* scheme of the pure mind and the inseparability of truth/ reality and falsehood.

* Huiyuan further specifies how he understands the meaning of the "inseparability of reality/truth and falsehood".


## # Huiyuan's View

* Huiyuan attempts to reconcile the t*athāgatagarbha* concept of a pure mind with the Yogācāra doctrine of *ālaya*-consciousness.
* He uses the concepts of "dependency and sustaining" or "root and branch" to explain the relationship between reality/truth and falsehood.
* According to Huiyuan, the "pure mind" implies the "inseparability of reality/truth and falsehood."

## # The Tiantai Viewpoint Of Zhiyi

* Zhiyi critiques both the Dilun and Shelun interpretations of mind, arguing that they present mutually exclusive views on the source of all things.
* He proposes a "threefold contemplation" to overcome these limitations:
    * Contemplation of emptiness (*kong guan*) deconstructs falsehood in language.
    * Contemplation of the false/provisional (*jia guan*) recognizes the instructive side of falsehood.
    * Contemplating the middle way (*zhongdao guan*) goes beyond both emptiness and the provisional, realizing the "real mark" (*shixiang*).

* Zhiyi emphasizes the indivisibility of truth/reality and falsehood, *dharma*-nature and ignorance.
* He uses the Avataṃsaka-s*ūtra* and Vasubandhu's *Abhidharmakośa* to support his understanding of mind.

#  The Buddhist Constructivist Approach To The Sense Of Reality

* Buddhists discuss the nature of mind and consciousness in relation to the process of transformation and liberation called "becoming a Buddha".
* Buddhists emphasize that our epistemic stance shapes the world we inhabit, with "mind" being the ground of all construction.
* Reality incorporates falsehood sustained by mind, while *tathāgatagarbha* represents truth and pure mind.

# Conclusion: The Buddhist Constructivist Approach To The Sense Of Reality

* Mahāyāna Buddhists view transformation as a shift from non-awakened to awakened state, upholding a constructivist position where ontology and epistemology coincide.
* The inseparability of truth/reality and falseness is central to this constructivism.
* Buddhist models differ in understanding inseparability but none support a metaphysical view of ultimate reality as a transcendent realm separate from our illusory world.

* "Ultimate reality" is ontologically indeterminable due to its inclusion of falsehood, making it inconceivable in a metaphysical sense.
* The *tathāgatagarbha* and Madhyamaka teachings highlight the dynamic understanding of truth and falsehood's inseparability through constant differentiation.

* This dynamic resembles a hermeneutical circle where understanding one aspect requires discerning the other.
* Fazang illustrates this with the analogy of a mirror reflecting both pure and impure images, emphasizing their interdependence and the underlying purity of the mirror.




# Oneness and Diversity

* Both oneness and diversity are interdependent aspects of reality.
* Their interplay constitutes each aspect, and vice versa.
* This dynamic applies to all events arising from multiple circumstances.
* Understanding either oneness or diversity requires considering both sides.
* Non-duality must be seen in terms of polarity, and vice versa.

# Fazang's Interpretation of the Dharma-Realm

* The number "ten" represents the complexity of differing aspects, while "one" symbolizes the oneness of their dynamic nature.
* Both are mutually complementary and embrace each other.
* Each of the ten embraces all ten because oneness contains all ten, and each ten contains the one.
* This mutual embracement characterizes the dharma-realm as an inexhaustible complexity of mutually constitutive layers.

# The Tenfold Profundity

* Fazang discusses Zhiyan's scheme of "interdependent arising viewed from the [perspective of the] tenfold profundity."
* This scheme embodies the essential tenet of the Huayan jing, representing the enlightened being's viewpoint on enlightenment.
* Fazang emphasizes the ninth link, focusing on mind as a unifying and diversifying force in interdependent arising.

# Mind and Reality

* All nine meanings manifest the single tathāgatagarbha as the intrinsically pure and clear mind.
* This mind, diversified into ten virtues, embraces all ten aspects, and vice versa.
* Fazang's view doesn't prioritize mind ontologically, as all ten aspects are equal in realizing their mutual embracement.

# Mere-Consciousness

* Fazang modifies his understanding of mind in the Huayan jing commentary.
* He replaces the ninth link with "gateway of embracing all virtues through the perfect illumination of the mutuality between the primary and secondary."
* The term "mere-consciousness" is explained based on Fazang's fivefold classification of Buddhist doctrine.

# Beyond Mere-Mind

* In the "perfect teaching," the terms "mind and consciousness" disappear as reality is seen as interdependent arising.
* This level sublates the concept of "mere-mind."
* Fazang distinguishes his view from the tathāgatagarbha doctrine, which seeks transformation through restoring the pure nature of mind.

# The Inexhaustible Dharma-Realm

* Fazang's understanding embraces not only the tathāgatagarbha meaning but also Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, and Hīnayāna perspectives.
* Diversity in manifesting ultimate reality is coextensive with oneness realized through mutual reflection of various views.
* This aligns with a constructivist paradigm where reality and truth are seen as systems of mutually constituting views and aspects of observation.

# Constructivism in Chinese Mahāyāna Buddhism

* Reality's sense is understood through the inseparability of truth and falsehood in both our understanding and existence.
* Cognitive systems lack independent access to a reality extrinsic to cognition.
* This insight into cognition is crucial for fully realizing the Mahāyāna sense of awakening and its soteriological significance.


# Jizang's Philosophy

* Jizang, a key figure in Chinese Mādhyamika thought, drew from Nāgārjuna and other Indian thinkers.
* He also built upon the work of earlier Sanlun thinkers like Sengzhao.
* Jizang's philosophy emphasizes the emptiness of determinate form or nature in all things.

# Indeterminacy Thesis

* According to Jizang, things are ontologically indeterminate: no linguistic item can truly and conclusively be applied to anything in terms of positing a determinate form or nature.

## Jizang's Philosophy of Ontic Indeterminacy

* This section introduces Jizang's philosophy and its connection to the Way (dao) and nonacquisition (*wude*).
* It explains how Jizang interprets the Indian Mādhyamika doctrine of twofold truth.
* The issue of understanding Jizang's notion of the Way is raised, questioning whether it refers to a metaphysical principle or a skillful expedient.

## Nāgārjuna's Doctrine of Emptiness

* This section outlines Nāgārjuna's doctrine of emptiness as presented in his *Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā*.
* It explains the concept of dependent origination and how it leads to the understanding of emptiness.
* The distinction between conventional truth and supreme truth is discussed, along with Nāgārjuna's view on the nature of reality.

## Sengzhao's Interpretation of Mādhyamika

* This section explores Sengzhao's interpretation of Nāgārjuna's doctrine of emptiness.
* It highlights Sengzhao's emphasis on notional codependence and how it influences his understanding of reality.
* Sengzhao's view on the nonreality of things due to their linguistic determination is presented, along with his acknowledgment of a supreme truth beyond conceptual grasp.

## Jizang's Philosophy in Relation to Nonacquisition and Ontic Indeterminacy

* This section will delve into Jizang's philosophy in relation to nonacquisition (*wude*) and ontic indeterminacy.
* It will analyze how these concepts are interconnected in Jizang's thought.

## Jizang's Notion of the Way

* This section offers a sustained analysis of Jizang's notion of the Way (dao).
* The aim is to clarify Jizang's ontological position through an examination of this concept.





# Sengzhao's Notion of Supreme Truth

* Sengzhao equates supreme truth with nonacquisition and conventional truth with acquisition.
* He believes the real arises from nonattachment and the unreal from attachment.
* He rejects acquiring nonacquisition, suggesting he may deny a higher reality or objective truth.
* However, Sengzhao also implies that supreme truth is an ineffable, formless principle, the pinnacle of all things.

# Jizang's Notion of Nonacquisition

* Jizang deepens Nāgārjuna's teaching about emptiness by highlighting nonacquisition as central to Mahāyāna scriptures.
* He argues against acquiring things or views, which leads to attachment and loss of spiritual freedom.
* For Jizang, things are ontologically indeterminate, existing differently for different observers.

# The Two Truths and the Middle Way

* Jizang warns against treating the two truths (conventional and supreme) as objects of acquisition.
* He sees them as provisional teachings pointing to the nondual middle Way.
* The middle Way is equated with nonabidingness, nonacquisition, and other terms signifying freedom from attachment.

# Levels of Truth and the Provisional

* Jizang proposes "three levels" and "four levels" of the two truths to counter determinate understanding.
* At the fourth level, all truths are conventional, while the supreme truth is forgetting speech and ceasing thought.
* This distinction reflects a separation between teaching (expressible in language) and principle (ineffable).

# Notional Codependence and the Middle

* Jizang emphasizes notional codependence, arguing that things are not definitively what they seem due to their interdependence.
* He uses speech and silence as an example, showing how concepts are provisionally defined in relation to each other.
* The middle Way transcends both provisional existence and emptiness, pointing to a state beyond conceptualization.

## 4

* Jizang's notion of the Way may indicate a state of mind free from any judgment or teaching, rather than a metaphysical principle.
* He refers to the Real as a nondependent state of mind free from judgment.
* This suggests he dispenses with higher reality and focuses on subjective freedom from acquisition.

## 5

* Jizang's ontological system consists of two interwoven layers: the middle and the provisional.
* The middle is the conceptually indeterminable nondual quiescence of oneself and things, known as the Way.
* It is revealed in nonconceptual experience and harbors all things in an undifferentiated state.
* The provisional comprises conceptually differentiated and interdependent things, expressible in language.

* Jizang doesn't posit a metaphysical reality beyond the Way; it contains all things in their undifferentiated state.
* The Way is not merely a conscious state of freedom from acquisition but is accessible only to a mind free from attachment.
* It is the preeminent source of soteriological value, abolishing linguistic fabrication and suffering.

## Divided Opinion among Chinese Commentators on Indian Interpretations of the Parable of the Raft in the *Vajracchedikā*

* This paper examines the different interpretations of the parable of the raft in the Vajracchedikā by Chinese commentators, focusing on Jizang, Zhiyi, and Kuiji.
* The paper investigates variations in the text itself, suggesting these variations may stem from Yogācāra circles in India.
* It explores how Chinese commentators interpreted *dharma* and *adharma*, highlighting the Madhyamaka and Yogācāra perspectives.



## 2 Variant Readings In The Parable Of The Raft In The Vajracchedikā

* Six Chinese translations of the *Vajracchedikā* exist in the Taishō Edition: Kumārajīva (Ku), Bodhiruci (Ruci-a and Ruci-b), Paramārtha (Pa), Gupta (Gup), Xuanzang (Xuan) and Yijing (Jing).
* The terms *dharma* and *adharma* appear in the parable of the raft, highlighting the concept of non-attachment to both.

## Variant Readings In Ruci And Asg

* Two variants exist in Bodhiruci's translation (Ruci-a) compared to other versions:
    * **Variant (b):** Instead of "one should neither grasp at *dharma*, nor grasp at *adharma*", Ruci-a reads "one should neither grasp at *dharma*, nor not accept *dharma*".
    * **Variant (c):** Instead of "one should abandon even *dharma*, not to mention *adharma*", Ruci-a reads "because these *dharma*s should be abandoned, [but] not rejected [altogether]".

* These variants also appear in some Indian commentaries, suggesting they were known in the Indic tradition.
* Asg-b and Ji support Variant (b), while Bodh supports both Variants (b) and (c).

## Determining Original Readings


* The origin of the two versions of Ruci and Asg is unclear.
* Based on Jizang's commentary, Asg-b is likely the original version.
* Since Ruci and Bodh are distinct translations, their variant readings may not be directly related.
* No other *Vajracchedikā* translations besides Ruci-a contain these variants, suggesting Ruci-b might be the original.

* The presence of Variants (b) and (c) in Asg and Bodh indicates they were likely known in the Indic tradition. Further investigation is needed to determine which readings were original in that context.

## 3 Chinese Translations Of Asaṅga'S Verses Of Passages (B) And (C)

* Two possible reasons for variants (b) and (c) in Chinese translations: They existed in Indian sources or were inserted during translation.
* Examining Asaṅga's verses twelve and fourteen, along with their Chinese translations, can help determine the origin of these variants.

## Verse Twelve (Passage and Variant b)

* Compares those who have faith with those who follow insight.
* The latter gains correct conception by grasping teachings, not through literal interpretations.
* Two Chinese translations, Bodh and Yi, offer different explanations for this verse.
* Both emphasize "grasping" in accordance with supreme insight, supporting Variant (b).
* Variant (b) appears in commentaries by different Indian commentators and in translations by different Chinese translators, indicating its Indian origin.

## Verse Fourteen (Passage and Variant (c))

* Discusses not abiding in phenomena and conforming to attainment.
* Grammatical ambiguity leads to differing translations in Verse-Bodh and Verse-Yi.
* Bodh and Yi both explain "conformity" in relation to attainment, supporting Variant (c).
* Both Variant (b) and (c) are likely original readings from India, possibly originating in Yogācāra circles.




## 4 The Chinese Madhyamaka Interpretation

* This section examines how Chinese sources interpret variant readings of the *dharma/adharma* passages in the parable of the raft from the *Vajracchedikā*.
* Zhiyi and Jizang, affiliated with the Madhyamaka school, are compared to Kuiji, associated with the Yogācāra.

## Zhiyi's Interpretation

* Zhiyi seems unaware of any variants in the parable of the raft.
* He interprets *dharma* as emptiness (medicine) and *adharma* as grasping at characteristics (sickness).
* He also sees *dharma* as upholding precepts and *adharma* as breaking them, or as the Middle Way between extremes.

## Jizang's Interpretation

* Jizang selectively uses different readings of the text and draws on various commentators to construct his own unique interpretation.
* He interprets *dharma* as phenomena (the five aggregates) and *adharma* as emptiness (no-*dharma*s).
* He agrees with Zhiyi that both *dharma* and *adharma* should be abandoned, emphasizing the emptiness of both wrong grasping and emptiness itself.

## Comparison with Indian Commentaries

* The Chinese commentators assimilated interpretations from both Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, but remained true to their own schools of thought.
* Jizang's interpretation deviates from Asaṅga's Yogācāra view on the nature of No-self.




##  The Chinese Madhyamaka Interpretation

* Ji adopts a selective and strategic approach to accepting both Asg and Bodh. 
* For Passages (a) and (d), he follows Asaṅga's interpretation, using *dharma* and *adharma* to mean "existence" and "non-existence" respectively.
* For Variant (b), he aligns with Bodh/Yi, interpreting *dharma* as the "teachings of the Buddha."

## The Chinese Yogācāra Interpretation

* Kuiji interprets *dharma* and *adharma* in line with Yogācāra philosophy. 
* He follows his predecessors Zhiyi and Jizang's interpretations for Passages (a) and (d).
* Unlike them, he understands "nor not *dharma*" as affirming the existence of the perfected nature, influenced by Bodh/Yi.

## Kuiji's Commentary on Passages (b) and (c)

* Kui follows Bodh/Yi closely in explaining these passages.
* He comments on Variants (b) and (c) instead of the readings found in the text he is supposedly commenting upon. 
* In his sub-commentary, Kuiji explains that "one should neither grasp at *dharma...*" means not grasping at things literally, while "...nor should one not accept *dharma*" refers to accepting teachings for supreme insight.

# Kuiji's Critique of Jizang

* Kuiji criticizes Jizang's view that ultimate truth is inexpressible and unfathomable, arguing that it leads to seeking truth outside teachings.
* He interprets *adharma* as seeking the nature of No-self outside the teaching, contrasting it with Jizang's understanding of *adharma* as a tentative device to be abandoned upon reaching ultimate truth.

# Kuiji's Synthesis of Asanga's Explanations

* Kuiji attempts to synthesize Asanga's explanations of Passages (c) and (d), drawing on Bodhi/Yi's commentary on Variants (b) and (c).
* He interprets *dharma* as teachings or specific items taught in them, leading to truth, while *adharma* is seeking truth outside teachings.

# Kuiji's Interpretation of the Dharma-body

* Kuiji argues that the Dharma-body should not be described as either existence or non-existence, drawing on Asanga's Passage (d).
* He interprets "not to be spoken of" in this passage as rejecting negation applied to the Dharma-body, rather than meaning it cannot be spoken of at all.

# Kuiji's Emphasis on Teachings

* Kuiji emphasizes the importance of teachings for attaining ultimate truth, contrasting with Jizang's view that *sūtra*s only refute falsehood.
* He argues that though the Dharma-body is inexpressible, it should still be taught using words and speech.

# Use of Variant Readings by Commentators

* Indian Yogācāra commentaries utilize Variants (b) and (c), while Chinese commentators show varying degrees of awareness of these variants.
* Ji follows Asanga's commentary containing only Variant (b), while Zhi and Kui rely on Kumārajīva's translation without acknowledging the variants.




## 6 Dharma And Adharma In The Chinese Translations

* Two different translations emerged for the phrase "na adharmasaṃjñā" in the *Vajracchedikā*:
    * Statement M: "without the conception of non-dharmas" (*wu fei faxiang* 無非法相) - Madhyamaka influenced.
    * Statement Y: "not without the conception of dharmas" (*fei wu faxiang* 非無法相) - Yogācāra influenced.

* These translations are consistently associated with specific translators and commentaries. 
* Exceptions include Pa, who shows a Yogācāra bias despite translating from a text without variants, and Yi, whose translations are inconsistent.
* Yi interprets "not without the conception of dharmas" as referring to emptiness, aligning with the Yogācāra perspective.

* Vaj also interprets "not without the conception of dharmas" as meaning that there are not absolutely no dharmas.

* Translators using Statement Y consistently provide Yogācāra interpretations.
* Those using Statement M, like Gu, offer interpretations compatible with Madhyamaka thought.

* The choice between "fei" (非) and "wu" (無) in translating "na adharmasaṃjñā" reflects the translator's philosophical affiliation. 




## 7 Indian Interpretations Of Dharma And Adharma

* Asaṅga sometimes interprets *adharma* as referring to the true nature of phenomena or the ultimate nature, that is, No-self.
* He supports this interpretation by explaining how inverted grasping gives rise to the conception of *adharma*, which he equates with No-self. 
* However, in one passage (Passage d), Asaṅga interprets *adharma* as referring to non-existence, contradicting his previous interpretations.

* Asaṅga's interpretation of *adharma* aligns with the early Mahāyāna understanding where negation of aggregates represents their true nature.
* Bodh/Yi, on the other hand, uses *adharma* in Passages (a) and (d) to mean non-existence, a false conception according to the original meaning of emptiness (*śūnyatā*) in the *Prajñāpāramitā*.

* Both Asaṅga and Bodh/Yi consistently use *dharma* to denote phenomena or existence when contrasted with *adharma*.
* In Variants (b) and (c), where *adharma* is absent, Bodh/Yi interprets *dharma* as "the teachings of the *sūtra*s", which can be understood as referring to objects taught in the scriptures. 




## 8 Dharma And Adharma In The Vajracchedikā

* This section discusses various interpretations of the parable of the raft in the *Vajracchedikā*.
* It analyzes the meanings of *dharma* and *adharma* as presented in different commentaries.
* A table summarizes the denotations of *dharma* and *adharma* across four passages discussed.

## Interpretation of Variants (b) and (c)

* Variant (b) and (c) should read: 
    * If people imagine *dharma* exists, they grasp at a self. If they imagine *adharma* exists, they also grasp at a self.
    * Therefore, one should neither grasp at *dharma* nor not accept *dharma*.
    * The Tathāgata tells the parable of the raft because these *dharma*s should be abandoned but not rejected.

* This interpretation suggests that clinging to either the existence or non-existence of *dharma* leads to grasping at a self.

## Interpretation of Passage (b) and (c)

* There is no consensus on interpreting Passage (b) and (c).
* The meaning of *adharma* in Passage (c) is crucial for interpretation.

* Possible interpretations of *adharma*:

    * **(a)** Items not taught by the Buddha (*tatpuruṣa*).
    * **(b)** Non-existence of items, which can be further divided into:
        * **(i)** Non-existence of conceptual imaginations (allowing for the true nature of phenomena).
        * **(ii)** Extreme negation (phenomena do not exist).

* Kui adopts interpretation (a), Asg suggests (b i), and Zhi and Ji lean towards (b ii).




# The Implications of Passage (b) and (c)

* The meaning of *adharma* is crucial to understanding the implications of these passages.
* Buddhist perspectives agree that *dharmas* do not exist as they appear.
*  The denial of *adharma* is more complex, with three possible interpretations:
    * Items not taught by the Buddha.
    * The true nature of things, devoid of the concept of *dharma*.
    * The misconception that something does not exist.

# Interpretations of Adharma

* Many scholars adopt the first meaning of *adharma*.
* The Prajñāpāramitā generally favors the second interpretation, implying letting go of all concepts, including truth.
* The third meaning aligns with Variants (b) and (c), where *dharma* should not be entirely rejected.

# Differences Among Commentators

* Vasubandhu (Bodh/Yi) and Kui use the second strategy, viewing *adharma* as a misconception about true nature.
* Zhi and Ji offer a unique interpretation: *adharma* acts as a provisional antidote against grasping and should ultimately be denied itself.

# Yogācāra and Madhyamaka Perspectives

* The Yogācāra tradition favors Variants over ordinary Passages (b) and (c).
* These Variants in the parable of the raft can be traced back to Indian Yogācāra commentaries.
* The change likely originated from interpretations within other schools, like the Madhyamaka, rather than the content of the parable itself.

# Reasons for Change

* Commentaries interpret "not *adharma*" differently: Bodh/Yi and Asg use it to negate non-existence, while Ji sees it as emptiness, an antidote against existence.
* The Yogācāra seeks to avoid interpreting emptiness as an antidote because they believe in the true nature of phenomena.

# Relation Between Versions

* Verse-Bodh and Verse-Yi contain Variants (b) and (c), suggesting earlier versions.
* Asg likely incorporated Variant (b) from a lineage of the *Vajracchedikā* not transmitted to us.
* Variants (b) and (c) in Ruci-a hint at another lineage containing these variants.

# Conclusion

* The selective attitude towards the *Vajracchedikā* in Chinese translations reflects similar trends in Indian transmission.

## Ideas about "Consciousness" in Fifth and Sixth Century Chinese Buddhist Debates on the Survival of Death by the Spirit, and the Chinese Background to *Amalavijñāna Michael Radich

* **This study explores the use of terms meaning "consciousness" in debates about the survival of death by the spirit in fifth and sixth century China.**
    * It examines how these concepts were used by Buddhist thinkers who argued that some part of a sentient being survives death.

* **The author argues that these debates should not be seen as simply a case of Chinese Buddhists misunderstanding basic Buddhism or lapsing into heterodox "*ātmavāda*".**
    * He suggests that there was a sound basis in translated Buddhist scriptures for the notion that some constituent of the person transmigrates.

* **The study also traces the use of specific terms like "consciousness" (*shi* 識) and *shishen* (識 神, "consciousness-cum-spirit")/*shenshi* (神識, "spirit-cum-consciousness").**
    * These terms are seen as potential antecedents to the *amalavijñāna* doctrine.

* **The author focuses on the writings of Lushan Huiyuan and other Buddhist thinkers who contributed to these debates.**
    * He analyzes their arguments and the terminology they used to support their positions.

## Zheng Daozi

* The term "consciousness" is only used by Zheng Daozi's opponent, not by Zheng himself.
* This may indicate that Buddhists had not yet realized the potential use of the term in defending their claims.

## Zong Bing

* Zong Bing clearly connects the transmigrating entity and consciousness.
* He uses *shi* (識) to mean vijñāna in a specifically Buddhist sense, as part of the twelvefold nid*āna* chain.
* Reincarnation occurs because continued mind functioning keeps vijñāna active.
* In the enlightened being, this vijñāna is missing, replaced by *shen* (神).
* Liberation involves the cessation of saṃskāra and vijñāna, leading to the completion of *shenming* (神明).

## An Anonymous Liu Song Text

* This text denies the doctrine of a surviving *shen* (spirit) in defense of correct Buddhism.
* It uses terms like *shenwo* (神我), indicating concern about *ātmavāda* heresy.
* The essay opposes *shenwo* to Buddha-nature (*foxing*) and *buddha* (fo), the "true self".
* It proposes "mind" (*xin*) as a thread of continuity guaranteeing the efficacy of moral acts, echoing a rough "mind-only" doctrine.



## 482 Radich Liang Wudi And Shenji'S Shenming Cheng Fo Yi, And Its Contexts

* **Introduction:** This section introduces Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty and his treatise *Shenming cheng fo yi*, which discusses the attainment of Buddhahood by the *Shenming*. The text is analyzed in relation to broader trends in Buddhist thought during this period. 
* **Influence of Tattvasiddhi and MPNMS:** This section highlights the influence of the *Tattvasiddhi* and MPNMS scholarship on Wudi and Shen Ji's work, particularly their connection between consciousness and Buddha-nature.

* **Wudi's Concept of "Shenming":** This section explains Wudi's use of the term "shenming" (神明) to represent the single, unchanging ground of all mental functions. It also discusses his question about who achieves buddhahood and how he implicitly identifies this substrate with Buddha-nature.

* **Wudi and Shen Ji on Consciousness:** This section explores Wudi and Shen Ji's understanding of consciousness (*shi* 識). They treat it as synonymous with "mind" (xin 心) and emphasize its momentary nature, potentially influenced by *Tattvasiddhi* scholarship.

* **Shen Ji's Commentary:** This section focuses on Shen Ji's interlinear comments on Wudi's essay, emphasizing his concept of a clear essence within consciousness that can lead to enlightenment. It also highlights Shen Ji's identification of "shenshi" (*神識*) as the cause proper for attaining buddhahood.

* **Connections to Śrīm and MPNMS:** This section examines the connections between Wudi and Shen Ji's work and key Buddhist texts like Śrīm and MPNMS. It specifically analyzes Wudi's use of the term *avidyāvāsabhūmi*, a concept derived from Śrīm, which refers to a fundamental ignorance that serves as a dwelling place for sentient beings.

* **Significance of Avidyāvāsabhūmi:** This section delves deeper into the meaning of *avidyāvāsabhūmi*, explaining its significance in both Śrīm and Wudi's work. It connects this concept with the notion of "active defilements" arising from this fundamental ignorance.

# The Momentariness of Mind

* Wudi's concern with the momentariness of mind stems from his reading of Śrīm, which states that subtle spirit cannot but be impermanent.
* This impermanence means that each moment of mind differs from its predecessor and goes out of existence together with its object.
* Wudi uses this idea to pose the question: "Who becomes buddha?"

# The Underlying Nature of Mind

* Wudi distinguishes between a momentary, changeable layer of mental content and an underlying substrate of the essence or nature of mind.
* This distinction is similar to Śrīm's concept of *avidyāvāsabhūmi*, which differentiates between incidental defilements and underlying structural conditions for them.

# The Power of AvidyāvāsaBhūmi

* In Śrīm, *avidyāvāsabhūmi* is the most powerful of all the *āvāsabhūmi*s because it cannot be destroyed by Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, or lower-level Bodhisattvas.
* Only the awakening and wisdom of the Tathāgata can destroy *avidyāvāsabhūmi*.

# Wudi's Use of AvidyāvāsaBhūmi

* Wudi draws on Śrīm's concept of *avidyāvāsabhūmi* to argue that ignorance (*wuming*) is fundamentally identical to spirit-illumination (*shenming*).
* This identification is supported by a quote from MPNMS, which states that ignorance and illumination are not dual but rather two aspects of the same reality.

# The Non-Dualism of Ignorance and Illumination

* Wudi's understanding of *avidyāvāsabhūmi* is influenced by MPNMS's doctrine of non-dualism.
* MPNMS argues that ignorance and illumination are not separate entities but rather two sides of the same coin, like dairy products derived from the same source.
* This non-dualism is crucial for understanding Wudi's concept of the "cause proper" of buddhahood.

# The Cause Proper of Buddhahood

* Wudi identifies mind (*xin*) as the "cause proper" of buddhahood, which aligns with the views of other contemporary exegetes like Sengrou and Zhizang.
* Shen Ji further specifies that this "cause proper" is *shenshi*.
* This concept is also supported by MPNMS's explanation of Buddha-nature, which states that sentient beings cannot see their Buddha-nature because it is covered by adventitious defilement.

# Contemporary Views on the Cause Proper

* Other prominent exegetes like Sengrou, Zhizang, Fa'an, Baoliang, and Sengzong also grappled with the concept of the "cause proper" of buddhahood.
* Their views varied but often emphasized the role of mind, spirit, or a substratum of Thusness as the ultimate source of enlightenment.

##  *Shenming* in Wudi's Essay

* The term *shenming* (神明) is central to Wudi's essay and its understanding requires exploring its background in Buddhist texts of the time.

* While *shenming* appears in earlier Buddhist texts, its usage was relatively rare and non-technical.

*  Wudi's contemporaries, especially eminent exegetes like Sengzong and Baoliang, used *shenming* extensively and technically, providing crucial context for Wudi's essay.

## Sengzong's Use of *Shenming*

* Sengzong uses *shenming* as the "cause proper" (zhengyin) for buddhahood, suggesting it is the essential principle underlying enlightenment.
* He employs *shenming* to explain how sentient beings in saṃsāra can possess Buddha-nature despite its impermanence.

## Baoliang's Interpretation of *Shenming*

* Baoliang identifies *shenming* as the "ineffable essence" (*shenming miaoti*) and the true, unconditioned dharma.
* He links *shenming* to the Śrīm doctrine, suggesting saṃsāra arises from the entanglement of *shenming* in causes and conditions.

## Connections between Wudi's Essay and Baoliang's Commentary

* Baoliang's commentary on a key passage in MPNMS echoes Wudi's essay, highlighting their shared understanding of *shenming* as the "cause proper" for buddhahood.
* Both Wudi and Baoliang connect this concept to the doctrine of Buddha-nature and ideas from Śrīm.

## Echoes of Consciousness (*shenshi*) in Wudi and Baoliang

* Both Wudi and Baoliang discuss the role of *shenshi* (consciousness) in relation to practice and enlightenment, suggesting an innate understanding of seeking happiness and avoiding suffering within sentient beings.
* This shared concern further demonstrates the interconnectedness of ideas circulating among Buddhist scholars at the time.





##  The Development of Ideas about Consciousness and Rebirth in Medieval Chinese Buddhism

* This essay examines the development of ideas about consciousness (vijñāna) and rebirth in medieval Chinese Buddhism, focusing on the contributions of Wudi and Shen Ji.
* These ideas emerged from a synthesis of earlier controversies about survival after death, influenced by Fan Zhen's polemic against the soul's existence, and new scholastic engagements with Abhidharma categories like those found in the *Tattvasiddhi*, Buddha-nature doctrines in MPNMS, and the tathāgatagarbha doctrine in Śrīm.
* The focus shifted from consciousness as a thread of continuity between ordinary incarnations to its role as the bridge between deluded and liberated states.

##  The Significance of Consciousness (vijñāna) in Medieval Chinese Debates

* The concept of "consciousness" (vijñāna), under various labels like *shenshi/shishen*, gained increasing importance in debates about survival after death.
* This study traces these developments through figures like Zong Bing, an anonymous Liu Song monastic author, Liang Wudi and Shen Ji, highlighting their reliance on Buddhist scriptures compared to other contributors who leaned on Chinese classics.

##  The Evolution of Consciousness (vijñāna) Concepts

* From Zong Bing onwards, vijñāna was linked to the twelvefold chain of dependent origination and understood as a succession of momentary states.
* The concept of a fundamentally pure mind requiring cleansing from defilements emerged, foreshadowing liberation as a "return to the origin."
* These ideas were applied not only to explain rebirth but also connected to the problem of liberation, with vijñāna viewed as a subject of liberation.

##  Rethinking the "Sinification" Hypothesis

* This study challenges the simplistic view that Chinese Buddhists adopted an *ātmavāda* (soul doctrine) to explain reincarnation, arguing that key terms in their sophisticated arguments were linked to vijñāna, not a concept directly comparable to the Indian polemical target of *ātman*.
* Similarities between aspects of vijñāna concepts in India and China are highlighted.
* The long history of these notions in Chinese Buddhist texts, possibly originating from jātaka/avadāna literature translations, suggests a deeper connection to Indian sources than previously recognized.

##  Amalavijñāna Doctrine: A Possible Precursor?


* This paper explores the possible background of *amalavijñāna* doctrine in both India and China.
* The ideas traced here resonate with *amalavijñāna*, concerning a type of vijñāna linked to rebirth through karmic efficacy but also possessing an aspect directed towards liberation through purification of the mind's substrate.

# The Process of Awakening in Early Texts on Buddha-Nature in India Michael Zimmermann
* This entry is a reference to the paper "The Process of Awakening in Early Texts on Buddha-Nature in India" written by Michael Zimmermann.

## Descriptions Of Buddha-Nature In Early Indian Texts

* The text explores two main concepts of buddha-nature found in early Buddhist texts: the theory of disclosure and the theory of development.
* **Theory of Disclosure:** This concept suggests that all living beings already possess perfect buddhahood within them, hidden like a precious gem. 
    * Awakening involves revealing this inherent buddha-nature through the guidance of a teacher.
    * The Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra (TGS) uses similes to illustrate this idea.

* **Theory of Development:** This concept proposes that buddha-nature is present as a potential or seed within beings, requiring nurturing and cultivation to reach full fruition. 
    * Awakening involves developing this potential through practice and effort.
    * The TGS also contains imagery supporting this theory.

## Awakening From The Perspective Of Sentient Beings

* The text contrasts the perspective on awakening presented in the TGS with that found in the Tathāgatotpattisambhava Nirdeśa (TUSN).
* **TGS:** Focuses on the individual sentient being and their inherent buddha-nature. 
    * Emphasizes the role of the individual in realizing their own buddhahood.

* **TUSN:** Presents a more cosmic view, highlighting the all-pervading nature of the Tathāgata's knowledge and compassion.
    * Sentient beings are seen as objects of the Tathāgata's grace, benefiting from his boundless wisdom.




## The Role Of The Buddha On The Path To Realization

* In the TGS, the exact role of the Buddha on the path to realization is not completely clear.
* Some passages portray the Buddha as an almighty father figure who takes care of and protects living beings.
* Other passages suggest a more limited role for the Buddha, functioning merely as someone who stimulates or encourages sentient beings to strive for awakening.

## The Path To Liberation

* No concrete descriptions of the path leading to liberation are found in early sūtras on buddha-nature.
* There are no particular recommendations for moral or spiritual practices provided.
* The main point seems to be to promulgate the new idea that all sentient beings have buddha-nature.

## Realization Of Awakening

* In the TUSN passage, realization of awakening is portrayed using the term *pratyabhijānīte*.
* This term suggests a kind of recollection of the vision of a buddha, rediscovering something which one has always been connected with inside oneself.
* The text stresses that sentient beings themselves remove their misconceptions and finally realize *tathāgatajñāna*.

## The Importance Of Religious Confidence And Motivation

* Religious confidence and motivation (*śraddhā*) is understood as a necessary means for approaching absolute reality.
* It is deemed necessary to break the doubts of those who do not find pleasure in the teachings of the Mahāyāna.
* Texts are largely silent about whether *śraddhā* can also function as the decisive (and maybe even exclusive) means for attaining awakening.

## Early Buddha-Nature Texts And Religious Emotionality

* The oldest layer of buddha-nature texts may belong to a branch of Mahāyāna Buddhism more oriented towards factors of religious emotionality.
* This branch emphasizes the non-rational recognition of the overwhelmingly positive and absolute character of buddhahood and buddha-nature.
* The RGV understands itself as an attempt to correct the failure to positively appreciate the factors that constitute buddhahood.



# The Efficacy Of Buddhahood

* Texts abound with descriptions of how buddhahood is imagined and how a buddha acts.
* RGV(V) dedicates the last two chapters to qualities of a buddha (*buddhaguṇa*) and the acts of a buddha (*jinakriyā*).
* TGS emphasizes that realizing one's buddha-nature leads to performing the tasks of a buddha.

* This automatic consequence demonstrates efficaciousness was key in early *tathāgatagarbha* thought.
* Buddha qualities are inseparably linked to absolute reality, which constitutes buddha-nature.
* Consequently, once living beings realize their true nature, their buddha qualities become active.
* This contrasts with other soteriological systems where buddha qualities are produced after realizing ultimate reality.

* *Tathāgatagarbha* texts promote the idea of a perfect uniformity of buddhahood in terms of all buddha qualities.
* All uncreated buddha-qualities unfold their efficacy, independent of individual practices before awakening.
* This aligns with the idea that all beings have buddha-nature and there cannot be an alternative level of liberation.
