# 1 Introduction

* The biggest problem in Buddhist Studies is determining the Buddha's actual teachings.
* Early texts contain doctrinal differences, making it difficult to identify authentic formulations.
* Historical claims of early Buddhist sects about their canons are unreliable and contradictory.
* Chronologically stratifying early Buddhist literature is crucial but challenging.
* There are no clear criteria to connect any text or idea directly to the historical Buddha.

* Some scholars believe that recovering the Buddha's teachings is impossible due to the lack of reliable historical information in the early literature.
* While acknowledging the challenges, the author argues that some passages in the early literature likely contain historically accurate information about the Buddha's life.
* The MahƗparinibbƗ*na Sutta* is cited as a potential source of reliable information about the Buddha's last months.

* Humorous statements attributed to the Buddha might also be authentic.
* However, historical facts alone do not necessarily reveal the Buddha's teachings.
* Establishing a connection between early Buddhist doctrine and historical fact is crucial for understanding the Buddha's teachings.

## The Study Of Buddhist Origins

* A basic presupposition is that early Buddhist literature is heterogeneous but historically valid despite modern scepticism.
* Scholars like Gregory Schopen argue against the antiquity and authenticity of early Buddhist texts, citing the lack of manuscripts dating back to the fifth century AD.
* However, the author argues that the existence of commentaries presupposes a textual tradition of some antiquity, suggesting that passages of genuine antiquity exist within the literature.

## Texts And Conventions

* All citations of PƗli texts refer to the volume, page and line numbers of PTS editions.
* NƗlandƗ and VRI editions were also consulted.
* Quotations from early Buddhist texts are taken from Limaye and Vadekar's edition.
* Quotations from the MahƗbhƗrata are taken from the Poona critical edition.
* All translations are by the author unless otherwise indicated. 




# A Note On Terminology

* The word 'meditation' has multiple meanings in early Indian texts and can refer to various religious practices.
* This text focuses on "enstatic" meditative practices where practitioners focus their awareness inward to detach from the external world.
* Various Sanskrit and Pali words describe these practices, with "absorption" and "inner-concentration" being suitable English translations.
* Buddhist practices are termed "formless meditation," focusing on non-physical "planes of reality."
* Brahminic practices are generally referred to as *yoga*, signifying "inner-concentration" or "discipline."

# 2 And Uddaka Rɩmaputta

* Some early Buddhist biographies claim the Bodhisatta (Buddha before enlightenment) learned "sphere of nothingness" and "sphere of neither perception nor non-perception" from Uddaka RƗmaputta.
* The historicity of these teachers is debated, but their appearance in various early Buddhist texts suggests they may have been real.

## Textual Sources And The Historical Problem

* The primary source for the Bodhisatta's training under these teachers is the Ariyapariyesana Sutta (APS), with similar accounts found in other suttas and Chinese translations.
* Both men are also mentioned in Vinayas and Snjtras, indicating they were considered potential recipients of the Buddha's teachings after his awakening.

* Scholarly opinion on the authenticity of these accounts is divided. Some scholars believe there is truth to them, while others consider them fabrications.
* The argument against their historicity often relies on the absence of information about the training in the MahƯĞƗ*saka Vinaya*, but this may be due to redactional activity rather than the account's fabrication.

## Arguments For The Historical Authenticity Of The Biographical Account In The Mahưğɨsaka Vinaya

* The MahƯĞƗ*saka Vinaya* omits details about the Bodhisatta's strivings before his awakening, possibly because its guardians removed this material.
* This omission does not necessarily indicate the account's antiquity or the fabrication of the teachers' existence.
* The argument that the MahƯĞƗ*saka Vinaya* lacks mention of the teachers in the account of the Buddha's decision to teach is also flawed.

* The APS already mentions their role as teachers earlier in the same text, making repetition unnecessary.
* Considering these arguments, there are few reasons to doubt the historicity of Uddaka RƗmaputta and their teaching of the Bodhisatta.

# Further Texts On The Two Teachers

* KƗlƗma was a clan or family name.
* The Buddha is said to have given a discourse to the KƗlƗmas in their town of Kesaputta in Kosala.
* There is evidence suggesting that Kapilavatthu had been annexed by the kingdom of Kosala during the Buddha's time.

# Uddaka Rɨ**Maputta And R**Ɨma

* The accounts of the Bodhisattva’s visits to both teachers are almost identical, but there is a subtle difference.
* It appears that it was not Uddaka RƗmaputta who attained the sphere of 'neither perception nor non-perception', but his father or spiritual teacher, RƗma.

# Other Peculiarities In The Ariyapariyesana Sutta

* The existence in fifth century BC northern India of two teachers of meditation called and Uddaka RƗmaputta can hardly be doubted.
*  The APS contains further peculiarities suggesting that it is the oldest account of the awakening.




## Philological Peculiarities

* The APS contains a linguistic anomaly in the form *huveyya*, which is probably a dialect form from an old Magadhan dialect.
* This suggests that the biographical tract contained in the APS is of considerable historical worth.
* Another philological peculiarity occurs in the account of training under two teachers, where the second-person pronoun has been preserved in a form only found elsewhere in verse.

## Narrative Peculiarities

* The APS is unique among Pali texts on the awakening of the Bodhisatta because it contains only the account of his visit to two teachers in its section on strivings.
* This suggests that the pre-sectarian version of the APS was closed to other accounts of the strivings.
* The omission of the Bodhisatta's austerities from the APS may be due to a narrative structure based around a peculiar formula describing the awakening.



# The Knowledge and Vision

* This section describes the Buddha's awakening as described in the Anguttara Nikaya Pali Suttas (APS).
* A unique pericope, describing unshakeable release and the end of rebirth, is found only in the APS when referring to the Buddha's awakening.
* The absence of descriptions of austerities and jhana states in the APS is unusual compared to other accounts.

# Polemic Peculiarities

* Bronkhorst suggests that the account of the Bodhisatta's visit to two teachers (Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta) is a polemic against non-Buddhist practices.
* However, the text doesn't explicitly condemn their meditative methods, instead portraying them as learned and wise individuals.
* The author argues that the account isn't clearly polemical or inclusivist (attempting to legitimize non-Buddhist practices).

# Conclusion

* The APS is considered the oldest account of the Bodhisatta's awakening due to its unique features, lack of clear polemic, and inclusion of historically verifiable details.
* The author believes that the APS likely records a historical event: the Bodhisatta being taught by Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. 




## The Aps As A Description Of The Buddha'S Awakening

* Simplicity suggests a description of liberating insight rather than a theory.
* APS account is simple and uses apophatic language, unlike the more complex MSS account.
* Simplicity implies older origin and greater historical worth.
* Other biographical episodes may not be comprehensive or include only relevant details.
* Difference between APS and MSS accounts requires explanation; possibly theoretical elaboration or independent development.

## The Terms 'Nothingness' And 'Neither And Perception Nor Nonperception' As Epithets Of Liberation

* Teachers' goals likely considered liberating by them, as implied by the Bodhisatta's pursuit of them.
* Narrative relies on the understanding that teachers aimed for liberation.
* Sarvāstivādin account of Uddaka Rāmaputta teaching a goal beyond 'nothingness' is unlikely and possibly reflects later Buddhist systematization.
* Dharmaguptaka Vinaya uses "meditative attainment" instead of "sphere," suggesting alternative terminology existed.

## Conclusion To Chapter 2

* APS likely contains the original or earliest extant account of the Bodhisatta's awakening.
* Evidence suggests historical existence of Uddaka Rāmaputta, Rāma, and their geographical locations.
* Teachers' goals were considered liberating but rejected by the Bodhisatta.
* This knowledge provides a basis for understanding the Buddha's intellectual development.

## 3 Formless Meditation And Early Brahminism

* Strong evidence suggests Brahminic origin of formless meditation due to parallels in early literature and connection to element meditation traditions.
* Element meditation schemes found in both Buddhist and Brahminic literature suggest borrowing from an early Brahminic source, possibly the teachers themselves.

## Verses On Meditation In The Mahɨbhɨ**Rata And Early Buddhist** Literature

* This section discusses similarities between meditative practices described in early Brahminic and Buddhist texts, suggesting an exchange of ideas between the two traditions.
* Examples are provided of verses from the *MahƗbhƗrata* and *Therag*ƗthƗ that share similar themes and language regarding meditation practices like self-discipline and controlling anger.
* The presence of a chariot metaphor in both traditions suggests a possible Brahminic origin, though this is not definitively established.

## The Elements And The Formless Spheres

* This section explores the connection between the material elements (earth, water, fire, wind) and the formless spheres in early Buddhist meditation.
* Lists of meditative objects found in the *SamƗ*dhi Sutta* and other Suttas include both elements and formless spheres.
* These lists are interpreted as apophatic definitions of a liberated state of consciousness, where the meditator transcends awareness of these objects.
* The final object in some lists is not a proper meditative object but rather a statement about liberation (e.g., "the cessation of becoming is *nibb*Ɨna").
* This suggests that the lists were adapted to emphasize the attainment of a specific state of consciousness rather than simply listing meditative objects.
* Despite this, the elements and formless spheres are recognized as proper objects of meditation in early Buddhism, likely leading to abstract states of consciousness and ultimately liberation.

## The

* The text discusses a list of meditative objects called "spheres of totality" found in Buddhist texts.
* This list connects formless spheres to the four elements (earth, water, fire, wind), colors (dark blue, yellow, red, white), space, and consciousness. 
* Each object is described as nondual, suggesting a connection to the Sanskrit adjective "all, whole, entire".

##  The word

* The meaning of the word in the context of meditative objects is debated.
* Dictionaries define it as an adjective ("all, whole, entire") or a noun ("meditative object").
* The text argues for understanding it as an abstract noun derived from the Sanskrit "kƗ*rtsna" (wholeness, totality).

##  The list of 'spheres of totality'

* This list includes the four elements, colors, space, and consciousness.
* The significance of the colors is unclear and may not be directly related to the elements.
* This list appears to be a variation on other schemes that also emphasize elements culminating in space and consciousness.




## Element Meditation And Early Brahminism

* The word  is used to describe something infinite (the cosmos) or nondual (the self).
* In the *Bhagavadg*ƯtƗ, is used adjectivally to indicate the 'total' sum of many parts or a nondual 'totality'.

* The list of colours in the also seems to reflect Brahminic notions.
* The sequence 'dark blue ĺ yellow ĺ red ĺ white' represents a transition from the gross to the subtle.

* The lists of elements studied correspond to early Brahminic element doctrines.
* Early Buddhists believed that everything could be broken up into five or six basic components.
* In a meditative context, the focus is not on breaking up the world into its elemental parts but rather on meditating on the elements themselves in their unmanifest and undivided state.

* The notion that the cosmos is structured according to an increasing level of refinement (earth ĺ water ĺ fire ĺ wind ĺ space ĺ consciousness) is reflected in both early Brahminic literature and Buddhist lists of element meditation.
* The Buddhist lists of element meditation seem to reflect a Brahminic cosmogony in which the elements were created by the Ɨ*tman/brahman*.

* It is more likely that the relationship between cosmology and meditation originated in early Brahminic circles, and from there was borrowed by the early Buddhists.
* Early Brahminic thinkers believed that cosmology provided the path to liberation.


## Element Meditation In The

* Evidence for element meditation in early Brahminism comes from the Mahabharata (Mbh XII).
* The practice involves meditating on the elements in a specific order: earth, wind, space, water, fire, intellect, and the unmanifest.
* This progression is believed to reverse the process of cosmic creation and lead to liberation.

## Element Meditation In Early Buddhism

*  Early Buddhist texts also mention element meditation.
* The elements are seen as suitable objects of meditation without a specific cosmological background.


## Cosmology And Meditation In Early Brahminism

* Cosmology plays a crucial role in shaping early Brahminic meditation practices.
* It provides the theoretical framework for understanding the meditative journey through the elements and beyond.
* Element meditation is considered one aspect of this broader cosmological approach to meditation. 


## Cosmology And Meditation In Early Brahminism

*  The relationship between cosmology and meditation is evident in detailed meditation schemes found in the Mbh XII.197 passage.
* This passage connects a teaching on meditation to cosmology, using analogies like water reflection to illustrate how calm senses lead to knowledge.
* It emphasizes the destruction of bad karma for attaining knowledge and seeing the self within.

## Cosmology And Meditation In Early Brahminism (continued)

* The text describes a path of reversing the cosmogony through meditation, starting from the mind and progressing towards higher consciousness and ultimately Brahman.
* Another example is found in Mbh XII.304, where meditation is based on a cosmology of twenty-five items, involving disciplining the self and focusing on progressively higher levels of consciousness.

## Cosmology And Meditation In Early Brahminism (continued)

* The text argues that element meditation likely originated in early Brahminic circles before being adopted by Buddhists.
* It suggests that Brahminic practices were borrowed and adapted by early Buddhists, with original Brahminic ideology discarded.
* This borrowing is supported by the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm in early Brahminic thought, where humans are seen as encompassing everything within themselves.

## Cosmology And Meditation In Early Brahminism (continued)


* The text concludes that element meditation and formless meditation likely have a Brahminic background due to their resemblance to Brahminic cosmologies and ideologies.
* It suggests that the two teachers of the Bodhisatta in early Buddhist texts might also have a Brahminic origin.

## The Goals Of The Two Teachers: Early **Parallels**

* Uddaka RƗmaputta's goal of 'neither perception nor non-perception' (*nevasaññƗnƗ*saññ*Ɨ) is similar to the Brahminic concept of *brahman*.
* Both concepts are described as 'nothingness' (Ɨ*kiñcañña*) or lacking characteristics.

## Further Evidence from Buddhist and Brahminic Sources 

* Non-Buddhist ascetics and Brahmins also believed in a self that was neither conscious nor unconscious after death, similar to Uddaka RƗmaputta's goal.
* YƗjñavalkya, a prominent Brahmin thinker, described the self as a state of intransitive consciousness after death, lacking an object but not devoid of awareness.

## The Goal as Intransitive Consciousness

* The Buddhist description of 'neither perception nor non-perception' suggests a state of awareness without an object, similar to YƗjñavalkya's concept.
* This state is attained through meditation and is characterized by transcending the sphere of nothingness.

## Uddaka RƗmaputta and Early Brahminic Tradition

* Uddaka RƗmaputta likely belonged to a pre-Buddhist Brahminic tradition where concepts like *brahman* and Ɨ*kiñcañña* were prevalent.
* Evidence from the *BrƗhma*ṇas suggests that the self was sometimes described as 'nothingness' or 'non-existence' in a figurative sense.

##  The Concept of Non-Existence in Early Brahminic Thought

* The *BrƗhma*ṇas contain passages suggesting that some early Brahminic thinkers believed the pre-creative state was a sort of non-existence (*asad*) or 'nothingness'.
* This notion aligns with Uddaka RƗmaputta's goal of Ɨ*kiñcañña*, which can be understood as a formulation of this early philosophical tradition.

## The Aphorism Passan Na Passati

* This section argues that the aphorism "seeing one does not see" (*passan na passati*) attributed to Uddaka RƗmaputta, an early Brahminic teacher, likely originated from a similar Sanskrit phrase found in the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad*.
* The aphorism is explained using the simile of seeing the blade of a razor but not its edge. However, this simile might have been inverted from its original form.

## A Possible Origin for Passan Na Passati

* The author suggests that the original simile likely described seeing the razor's edge and not its surface, representing a state of subtle awareness without a tangible object.
* This interpretation aligns with the concept of "neither perception nor non-perception" (*nevasaññƗnƗsaññƗ*), a meditative state characterized by awareness without an object.

## Buddhist Reinterpretation

* The Buddha might have inverted the simile to critique Uddaka RƗmaputta's teaching and highlight his own doctrine of clear revelation.
* This "twisting" of terminology is consistent with other instances in early Buddhist literature where the Buddha reinterprets opponents' views.

## Connection to Brahminic Thought

* The Sanskrit phrase *paĞyan vai tan na paĞ*yati* from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* describes a similar state of consciousness during deep sleep, where awareness persists without perceiving objects.
* This phrase is semantically and syntactically close to *passan na passati*, suggesting a possible connection between them.

## From Upanishadic Teaching to Yogic Practice

* The author proposes that the phrase *paĞyan vai tan na paĞ*yati* was abstracted from its original context in the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* and used independently to describe intransitive consciousness.
* This concept likely influenced early yogic practices, which aimed to achieve a state of consciousness resembling deep sleep.

## Conclusion

* The PƗli aphorism *passan na passati* likely originated from a Brahminic source, possibly the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad*.
* Uddaka RƗmaputta's association with this aphorism suggests his involvement in a yogic milieu influenced by nondualistic teachings.

## Conclusion To Chapter 3

* Element meditation is connected to formless meditation in early PƗli texts.
* Both meditations share a doctrinal background based on the list of six 'strata' (earth, water, fire, wind, space and consciousness) found in early Brahminic cosmologies.
* This suggests element meditation and formless meditation originated in early Brahminic circles.

# 4 The Philosophy Of Early Brahminic Yoga

* There are objections to the theory that formless meditation originated from Brahminism due to lack of pre-Buddhist evidence for meditation in Brahminic texts.
* However, the Buddhist evidence for element meditation reflects Brahminic ideology and supports a Brahminic origin.
* This chapter will explore the relationship between meditation and cosmology in early Brahminic texts.
* It will argue that this development is rooted in speculation from the late Vedic period.
* The chapter will investigate the cosmogonic background to the scheme of element meditation found at Mbh XII.228.
* It will also examine the NƗsadƯyasnjkta for evidence of a contemplative tradition in the late Vedic period.
* Finally, it will attempt to reconstruct a pre-Buddhist form of element meditation from early texts and explain its connection to Buddhist forms of meditation. 




## Cosmogony In The **(Mbh Xii.291)**

* A detailed cosmogony, found in one of the most important philosophical tracts of the Mahabharata (the Mbh XII.291–96), corresponds to the scheme of element meditation contained in Mbh XII.228.
* It begins with a verse on the world ages (291.14, *yugadharma*), after which there is a detailed account of world creation:

* The cosmogony outlines a vertical pattern of world creation, each item being created from the item created before it. 
* After this the pattern is both vertical (sequential) and horizontal (collective): the collective creation of the five elements is followed by two successive phases in which the five objects of sense and then eleven organs (the ten faculties plus mind) are created collectively.

* The most striking feature of this cosmogony is that the awakening of *brahman* initiates world creation.
* The first creation is called *buddhi,* among other things, indicating the close relationship between the awakening of *brahman* and the first stage of creation.
* The next creation is termed ('the utterance I') or prajƗ*pati*.

* The cosmogony appears to be a sophisticated development of the creation myth of BU I.4.1, which is itself a reformulation of even older mythological notions.
* Mbh XII.291 provides the philosophical background to the scheme of *yoga* found at Mbh XII.228.13–15. 

* The meditative scheme ĺ vƗyu ĺ kha ĺ payas ĺ jyotis ĺ ĺ buddhi ĺ *avyakta* (Mbh XII.228.13–15) is a reversal of the cosmogony outlined in Mbh XII.291.
* There is no question of any outside influence in the cosmogony of Mbh XII.291.



## Speculative Tradition and Early Brahminic Meditation

* The speculative tradition behind early Brahminic meditation likely predates Buddhism.
* While cosmogonic ideas from pre-Buddhist texts exist, no texts on meditation have been found from that era.
* This suggests the contemplative tradition may have developed later within Brahminism or originated elsewhere and was later elaborated upon by Brahmins.

## Cosmogony In The Nɨsadưyasnjkta

* The NƗsadƯyasnjkta is a seven-verse hymn describing the origin of the world in an obscure manner.
* It presents a series of paradoxical images, suggesting a process of creation from a primordial state of unity.
* The hymn emphasizes the ambiguity and unknowability of the creative process, leaving many questions unanswered.
* Brereton interprets "thought" as the driving force behind this creation, preceding "desire" and "heat."
* However, this interpretation is debated due to the poem's complex structure and lack of clear conclusions.

# Problems with Brereton's Interpretation

* Brereton's interpretation of *tád* as an adverb of time in verse 4a is problematic because it creates a redundant construction and contradicts the structure found elsewhere in the poem.
* Taking *tád* as a pronoun, as suggested by Macdonell, leads to a more coherent reading where desire arises from "That One" mentioned earlier.

# The Role of Desire

* According to Macdonell's interpretation, desire is the "first seed of mind," suggesting that it is the essence of thought and consciousness.
* This desire, arising in the One, is a form of cognitive essence that will develop into the mind.

# Confusion Over Relative Clauses

* The relative/correlative construction *yád…tán* in verse 3cd can be interpreted as either pronominal or adverbial, leading to different cosmogonies.
* The agreement of *tán* with *(e)kam:* in verse 3d suggests a connection between the subject of verse 3d and "That One" mentioned earlier, but this identification is disputed by alternative interpretations.

# Ambiguity and the Role of Thought

* The NƗsadƯyasnjkta's ambiguity may be intentional, inviting multiple interpretations and encouraging contemplation.
* The poem emphasizes the role of thought in creation, suggesting that the universe's riddle can be solved through human thinking.

# The Mystery Beyond Thought

* While thought is presented as a creative force, it cannot fully grasp the state before its emergence.
* The poem acknowledges the limitations of thought and leaves readers with unanswered questions about the origin of everything.




## Cosmogony In The **(Mbh Xii.224)**

* This section discusses an early cosmogony found in Mbh XII.224. 
* It argues that this cosmogony is philosophically related to the NƗsadƯyasnjkta but doesn't correspond to any known yogic scheme in early Brahminic literature.
* The sequence of elements in this cosmogony aligns with the six dhƗ*tu-s*, suggesting it may be the theoretical foundation for element meditation found in early Buddhist texts.

## 1 Introduction  The _Fractional State_ of the Universe is a fundamental problem in cosmology.

* This section introduces the concept of the "Fractional State" of the universe as a key problem in cosmology.
* It suggests that the theory presented in this chapter aims to address this problem.


## Conclusion To Chapter 4

* This section summarizes the arguments made in the previous chapters regarding the origin of element meditation in early Buddhism.
* It concludes that element meditation likely originated from Brahminic meditative circles and was adopted by early Buddhists, possibly through teachers like Uddaka RƗmaputta.
* The chapter emphasizes the connection between cosmology and meditation in early Brahminism, tracing it back to the NƗsadƯyasnjkta.

## Appendix To Chapter 4: The Early Yogic Doctrine Of Karman

* This section introduces a discussion on the early yogic doctrine of karman, drawing from passages in the SuttanipƗta.
* It argues that the Buddha's teachings in these dialogues align with the theory that he was taught in a Brahminic school of meditation.
* The appendix aims to demonstrate how understanding the Buddha's knowledge of early Brahminic meditation is crucial for interpreting these dialogues correctly.

## Mbh Xii.180.28–29:

* This section highlights verses from Mbh XII.180.28-29 that support the idea that realizing the self through meditation leads to the destruction of karman.
* It emphasizes the connection between self-realization, meditative practices, and liberation from karmic bondage in early Brahminic thought. 




## Mbh Xii.197.8

* Knowledge arises when bad karma is destroyed.
* One sees the self in the self like a mirror's surface.

## Mbh Xii.238.10

* Ascetics abandon good and bad karma through tranquil thought.
* They attain endless bliss by establishing themselves in the self.
* Liberation is truly attained at death.

## 5 Meditation In The Pɩrɩyanavagga

* The Buddha was taught a form of early Brahminic meditation.
* The *Ariyapariyesana Sutta* suggests the Buddha taught some meditative practice to his first disciples.
* Texts in the PƗrƗ*yanavagga* depict the Buddha in dialogue with Brahmins on meditation.
* The dialogue with UpasƯva is especially important as it shows the Buddha's familiarity with early Brahminic meditation presuppositions. 
* Dialogues with Udaya and PosƗla teach a form of meditative practice and liberating insight concordant with the teachings given to UpasƯva.





## The Antiquity Of The Pɨrɨyanavagga

* The PƗrƗ*yanavagga* is very old, likely predating the formation of the *Suttanip*Ɨta.
* Evidence includes its commentary by the Niddesa and mentions in ancient texts like the DivyƗvadƗna.
* Linguistic and metrical features also suggest antiquity.

## Dating The Pɨrɨyanavagga

* Some Suttas from the *Suttanip*Ɨta are mentioned in AĞoka's edict, suggesting a pre-AĞokan date for the PƗrƗ*yanavagga*.
* Other Suttas appear in the MahƗ*vastu*, potentially predating the first schism in Buddhism.

## The Composition Of The Pɨrɨyanavagga

* Some scholars argue that the PƗrƗ*yanavagga* is a compilation of different strata, not a homogeneous text.
* This view is based on the diversity of meditative ideas presented in the text.
* However, this argument relies on assumptions about the meaning of certain terms and practices.




## Sn 1069–76

* This text is a dialogue between the Buddha and UpasƯva about the nature of liberation from suffering.
* UpasƯva asks how to cross over the "flood" (suffering) through meditation.
* The Buddha instructs him to focus on "nothingness."
* UpasƯva then questions the state of someone who has attained this "nothingness."

## Sn 1071–72

* UpasƯva asks if someone who has reached a state of "highest release from perception" would remain in that state.
* The Buddha confirms they would.
* This section clarifies that the person is not yet liberated but concentrated in a meditative state.




# Sn 1071–72: Anɨnuyɨyư

* The text discusses the translation of the word *anɨnuyɨyư* in the Sutta Nipata (Sn) verses 1071-72.
* Rhys Davids and Stede's interpretation of *anɨnuyɨyư* as "subject to" is challenged, with a more plausible explanation being "not following."

# The Meaning of Anɨnuyɨyư

* The meaning "not following" is derived from the verb root *anu+*¥yƗ, which means "to follow."
* This interpretation aligns with the context of the verses, where the subject has attained a state of nothingness and does not "follow" other meditative states.

# Commentary on the Verses

* Nidd II and Pj II understand UpasƯva's question in v. 1071d as inquiring whether the person who has attained nothingness can sustain it without falling away from it.
* Both commentaries suggest that *anɨnuyɨyư* refers to remaining in a formless sphere after death, which is not supported by the text.

# The Importance of SatƯmƗ

* The adjective *satƯmƗ* in v. 1070a is usually understood as "possessing mindfulness" but may have a more dynamic cognitive meaning.
* It likely indicates awareness of sense objects while in the state of nothingness, highlighting a key difference between early Buddhist and Brahminic meditation practices.

# UpasƯva's Question

* UpasƯva's question in v. 1071d suggests that he was unsure if sustained mindfulness (satƯmƗ) was compatible with attaining and maintaining the state of nothingness (*anɨnuyɨyư*).
* The combined meaning of these terms implies a unique approach to meditation in early Buddhism, where awareness is maintained even during deep meditative states.

# Sn 1071–72:

* The reading in v. 1071c is preferable, suggesting that *vimutto* can be explained as a normal variant for *adhimutto*.
* UpasƯva's question about the sustained practice of 'nothingness' seems peculiar unless the Buddha said something unexpected about it.
* The Buddha's use of the adjective *satƯmƗ* suggests he was introducing a new teaching: meditative absorption should be combined with mindfulness.

# Sn 1073–74: Sưtisiyɨ

* The correct understanding of UpasƯva's third question depends on understanding his second question, as they are part of a temporal sequence.
* Norman's translation of v. 1073 is likely incorrect due to his different interpretation of v. 1071–72.
* Three possible explanations for the compound sƯ*tisiy*Ɨ: liberation, death, or both simultaneously (death and liberation in one go).
* The presence of *vimutto* in v. 1073c suggests that sƯ*tisiy*Ɨ is synonymous with liberation.
* UpasƯva wants to know if consciousness remains when the person has 'become cool' or liberated.

# Commentarial Tradition on Sn 1073:

* The commentarial tradition is confusing and unhelpful in understanding the original meaning of the verse.
* Nidd II interprets both 1073c and 1073d as two possible answers to an 'if' clause posed in 1073ab, suggesting alternative eventualities for the person who has attained 'nothingness'.
* Pj II understands that 1073cd presents at least three possibilities for the fate of the attainer of 'nothingness', with pƗda (d) presenting alternatives to the possibility stated in pƗda (c).



# To come to a more satisfactory answer to the problem of sƯ*ti-siy*Ɨ

* We should see what UpasƯva says in the remainder of the dialogue for clues about his meaning.
* We should look for occurrences of forms based on ĞƯtƯ-¥bhnj as a metaphor for liberation in early Brahminic literature.
* We can attempt to understand the term sƯ*tisiy*Ɨ based upon its occurrences in the Pāli Canon.

# UpasƯva's question in v. 1075

* For UpasƯva, sƯ*tisy*Ɨ refers to death and liberation at the same time.
* The Buddha uses the metaphor of 'going out' (paleti) to describe the person who has 'become cool'.
* UpasƯva asks if the liberated person exists after death or is eternally without disease.

#  The early Brahminic background

* In early Pāli literature, the question of the liberated person existing eternally is an eschatological question.
* The BrahmajƗ*la Sutta records various opinions about the existence of the self after death.
* UpasƯva's question suggests he believed liberation was attained at death.

# ĞƯtƯ-¥bhnj in the Mahābhārata

* No forms of ĞƯtƯ-¥bhnj are found in the early Pāli Canon, but the past passive participle ĞƯtƯbhnjto is found in one verse (Mbh XII.192.122).
* This verse describes the state of the liberated 'mumbler' (jƗ*paka:* a reciter of Vedic mantras) who attains *brahman*.

#  UpasƯva's understanding of liberation

* UpasƯva seems to have held the standard early yogic view that liberation is attained at death.
* He may have been knowledgeable about the sort of yoga described in the early verse and Brahmanas.
* The view that the self is an unchanging 'consciousness' is well attested in early Brahminic texts.

# Summary

* UpasƯva introduced the concept of sƯ*tisiy*Ɨ to ask a question about the death/liberation of the attainer of 'nothingness'.
* Mbh XII.192 suggests that ĞƯtƯ-¥bhnj was a metaphor for liberation at death.
* UpasƯva seems to have believed that the Buddha was talking about the meditative 'anticipation' of liberation in life.
* The interpretation offered here suggests that the Buddha was not talking along such lines.

# Sn 1073–76: The Metaphors 'Becoming Cool' (Sưti+¥Bhnj) **And 'Going** Out' ( +¥Gam)

* The Buddha uses the metaphor of "going out" in response to UpasƯva's question about "becoming cool."
* This metaphor is interpreted as referring to liberation in life, similar to a flame being extinguished and becoming unreckonable.
* The compound "nƗmakƗyƗ vimutto" (released from the category name) is analyzed, suggesting it refers to liberation from mental constructs rather than physical form.

#  The Metaphor of 'Going Out' in Other Texts

* The metaphor of "going out" appears in other Buddhist texts, describing a person liberated in life who has transcended passion, aversion, and ignorance.
* This reinforces the interpretation that "going out" signifies liberation achieved while alive.

# The Metaphor of 'Becoming Cool' (SƯti+¥Bhnj)

* The compound "sƯtibhnjto" is frequently used to describe a person who has attained liberation in this life, experiencing bliss and satiation.
* It appears in the Buddha's declaration of liberation and in verses by liberated bhikkhus. 
* While there are instances where "becoming cool" refers to the cessation of feelings at death, these are not relevant to the interpretation in Sn 1073.

#  The Dialogue Between the Buddha and UpasƯva

* The dialogue suggests a misunderstanding between the Buddha and UpasƯva regarding liberation.
* UpasƯva seems to associate liberation with death, while the Buddha emphasizes liberation in life.
* The Buddha consistently interprets "becoming cool" as referring to liberation attained while alive.


#  The Meaning of 'Dhamma'

* The word "dhamma" is analyzed in its various occurrences within the text. 
* It is argued that in the context of v. 1076, "dhamma" likely refers to mental phenomena rather than physical phenomena.
* This interpretation aligns with other instances where "dhamma" is used to describe mental states and liberation from mental constructs.

# The Indefinability Of The Sage

* The Buddha's point is that because the sage is freed from concepts or language, he is therefore indefinable, like an extinguished flame.
* This metaphor of the extinguished flame is also used in the *Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta*, where the Buddha declares that it is not possible to reckon the state of the TathƗgata, since he is like a flame gone out.

# The *Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta*

* In this Sutta, the TathƗgata is compared to an extinguished flame—both are indefinable because they have gone beyond the criteria necessary for them to be defined.
* The five aggregates are usually termed upƗdƗna-kkhandha*, which literally means 'bundles of fuel'. This metaphor suggests that the five aggregates are the fuel necessary for the continuation of phenomenal experience.

#  The Fire Metaphor


* The fire metaphor used in the *Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta* and the is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience.
* It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life.

#  The Metaphor of 'Becoming Cool'

* UpasƯva's use of the metaphor 'become cool' in Sn 1073 shows that the similes originally referred to the adept's attainment of union with *brahman* at death.
* The Buddha subverts this metaphor by suggesting that one becomes brahman, so to speak, in this very life ( *va dhamme),* not in death.

#  The Liberated Sage and Ontological Categories

* For the Buddha, the concepts of life and death, existence and non-existence, and even whether a person is conscious or not, do not apply to the liberated person.
* This perspective distinguishes the Buddha's teaching from that of the NƗsadƯyasnjkta by virtue of the fact that ontological categories are not taken at face value, but are seen merely as concepts that do not apply to the liberated sage during his life. 




## The Historical Significance Of The

* **The dialogue with UpasƯva can be summed up as follows:**
    * UpasƯva asks about meditative objects to escape suffering.
    * The Buddha suggests observing 'nothingness' mindfully, combining meditation and mindfulness.
    * UpasƯva questions the sustainability of this state.
    * The Buddha assures him it can be sustained.
    * UpasƯva inquires about consciousness after liberation.
    * The Buddha states that the living liberated person transcends conceptual frameworks.

* **The dialogue with UpasƯva depicts an interaction between a religious teacher with new ideas and an adherent of an existing religion.**
    * It exemplifies the Buddha's 'skill in means,' revolutionizing old religious ideas.
    * Initially, UpasƯva understands the concept but struggles with its implications.
    * Later, he fails to grasp the Buddha's words, remaining bound by Brahminic ideas.

* **The historical worth of this document cannot be underestimated.**
    * It records a remarkable interchange where two individuals speak at cross-purposes.
    * The Buddha adopts UpasƯva's perspective and gradually leads him towards Buddhist concepts.
    * This method demonstrates courtesy, dignity, dialectical skill, and mastery of ethical points.

* **The authors likely had a clear memory of the Buddha's conversational style.**
    * They may have even remembered specific occasions and individuals.
    * The intricate nature of the exchange suggests it was based on real events.
    * Committees rarely compose teachings with such nuanced cross-purpose dialogue, indicating its historical accuracy.





## The **(Sn 1105–11)**

* This dialogue depicts the Buddha as adapting Brahminic practices and metaphors.
* It outlines principles of Buddhist teachings like mindfulness, liberation in life, and the indefinability of a sage.
* It doesn't explicitly describe stages to liberation or liberation itself.

## Dialogue with Udaya (Sn 1105-1111)

* This dialogue elaborates on what the Buddhist path comprises.
* The Buddha defines "release through understanding" as overcoming hindrances, investigating mental phenomena, and attaining equanimity and mindfulness.
* This definition parallels the four stages of meditation (jhāna).
* The dialogue highlights the importance of abandoning craving and delight for liberation.
* It emphasizes the role of mindfulness in observing sensations without attachment.

##  Consciousness and Liberation


* Udaya asks how consciousness is "stopped" for someone who meditates mindfully.
* This question might be about attaining liberation, though the exact meaning of "stopping" consciousness is unclear.
* The Buddha's response could indicate a difference in understanding consciousness compared to his dialogue with UpasƯva.
* It's possible the Buddha adapts his language based on the questioner's perspective and uses "stopping" metaphorically.

## The **(Sn 1112–15)**

* This passage expands on teachings from previous dialogues, focusing on how liberation is achieved through understanding rather than just meditative states of nothingness.
* It contrasts the Buddha's teaching with standard Brahminic methods, highlighting the importance of cognition in attaining enlightenment.

## Conclusion To Chapter 5

* The dialogues with UpasƯva, Udaya and PosƗla offer valuable insights into meditation practices.
* The dialogue with UpasƯva is particularly significant due to its historical implications and detailed depiction of early Brahminic meditative thought.
* The Buddha's familiarity with these concepts suggests he was likely taught by ƖlƗra KƗlƗma and Uddaka RƗmaputta, as claimed in the *Ariyapariyesana Sutta*.

* Circumstantial evidence within these texts supports their historical authenticity, despite the lack of direct proof.
* The intricate nature of the dialogue with UpasƯva, for example, makes fabrication unlikely. 
* This strengthens the argument that the Buddha's knowledge of Brahminic meditation stemmed from his own experiences as a student under these teachers.

# 6 Conclusion The Origin Of Buddhist Meditation And Early Buddhism

* and Uddaka RƗmaputta were religious teachers in northern India who taught meditative practices aimed at achieving a nondual state of meditation identical to brahman.
* They termed this nondual goal 'nothingness' (Ɨ*kiñcañña)* and 'neither perception nor nonperception' (nevasaññƗnƗ*saññ*Ɨ) respectively.

* The Bodhisatta was taught by them but rejected their goals, seeking liberation through mindfulness and insight.
* The Buddha adapted old yogic techniques to the practice of mindfulness and attainment of insight. 

* He taught that liberation is achieved through a meditative state retained with mindful awareness, leading to an understanding of the nature of meditative experience.
* This insight was considered nondual in a radical sense, transcending conceptual dualities.

* The Buddha's dialogues with UpasƯva and PosƗla suggest that his advocated insight was non-intellectual.

* The *Ariyapariyesana Sutta* is presented as evidence for the Bodhisatta being taught by and Uddaka RƗmaputta.
*  The peculiarities of this Sutta, such as its simple description of liberating insight and unique philological forms, suggest its authenticity.

* The author argues that the Bodhisatta's training under these teachers is corroborated by the *MahƗ*-Saccaka Sutta*, which suggests a religious teacher knowledgeable about particular meditative practices.
* The author deduces that and Uddaka RƗmaputta's meditative goals had a Brahminic origin, based on correspondences between their teachings and early Brahminic concepts.

* The connection between formless meditation and element meditation in Buddhist texts is presented as evidence for their shared origin in early Brahminism.
* The author concludes that the practice of was known in Brahminic circles and likely influenced the Buddha's teachings.

# Different Interpretations of Early Brahminic Meditation

* Johannes Bronkhorst suggests formless meditation was borrowed from Jainism.
* He believes early Brahminic meditation emphasized stopping all bodily and mental activity, similar to Jaina practices.

# Problems with Bronkhorst's Theory

* The theory conflates texts with and without references to extreme asceticism.
* Early Brahminic texts on meditation don't mention ideals like fasting to death or painful breath restraint found in other Brahminic texts.
* A separate tradition of meditation focused on pleasurable practices existed within early Brahminism.

# Diversity in Ascetic Traditions

* Early Jaina, Brahminic, and Buddhist schools had distinct ascetic traditions despite some common features.
* Breath restraint, while present in various texts, doesn't indicate a unified meditative tradition due to significant differences in its practice across texts.

# The Meditative Mainstream

* Extreme physical asceticism played a minor role in the early Brahminic meditative mainstream.
* This tradition aimed for liberation from karma through self-realization.
* While some practiced emaciation, major Brahminic texts suggest these practices were marginal.




## The Relationship Between Early Buddhism And Brahminism

* Some early Buddhist texts contain Brahminic views, leading some scholars to propose a "precanonical Buddhism" distinct from canonical Buddhism.
* This "precanonical Buddhism" is thought to have been based on the belief in six dhƗtus and a permanent blissful state called Like at the peak of existence. 
* Canonical Buddhism, according to this theory, reacted against these ideas, emphasizing impermanence and rejecting absolutist tendencies.

*  Scholars like Lindtner, Schayer, and Keith cite passages in early Buddhist texts that seem to reflect Brahminic ideology, such as the concept of consciousness as ultimate reality or the description of Nirvana as a place one can go to.
* They argue that these passages represent an early phase of Buddhism before it became canonized.

* The author challenges this theory, arguing that the evidence does not necessarily point to a distinct "precanonical Buddhism." 
* The author suggests that some early Buddhists may have retained Brahminic beliefs even after converting to Buddhism, leading to heterogeneity in early Buddhist literature.
* This heterogeneity is also noted by scholar Louis de La Vallée Poussin.

* The author proposes that the Buddha himself rejected early Brahminic teachings and emphasized mindfulness and liberating insight over substantialist beliefs. 
*  The presence of Brahminic influences in some early Buddhist texts can be explained as the result of conversions from Brahminism, rather than a separate precanonical phase.

## An Early Buddhist Controversy: Meditation Or Intellectualism?

**La Vallée Poussin's Claim:**

* La Vallée Poussin argued that two paths to liberation existed in early Buddhism.
* One path emphasized intellectual understanding (dhamma).
* The other path focused on meditative concentration and suppressing mental activity.
* He based this claim on the MahƗ*-Cunda Sutta and Kosambi Sutta.

**The MahƗ*-Cunda Sutta:**

* This sutra describes a disagreement between "intellectual" bhikkhus (devoted to doctrine) and "meditating" bhikkhus.
* Intellectuals valued understanding the dhamma through deep thought.
* Meditators emphasized achieving liberation by directly experiencing the deathless realm ("touching it with the body").

**The Kosambi Sutta:**

* This sutra features MusƯla, who claims to understand dependent origination and nibbana intellectually.
* NƗrada also understands these concepts but doesn't consider himself liberated.
* He compares his knowledge to seeing water in a well but not being able to touch it, suggesting that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient for liberation.

**Interpreting "Touching the Deathless Realm":**

* The expression "touching the deathless realm with the body" likely refers to achieving liberation through meditation.
* This phrase appears frequently in contexts discussing formless meditations practiced by Uddaka RƗmaputta.
* Some scholars believe these formless meditations led to saññƗ*vedayitanirodha (cessation of perception and feeling), which might be another way of describing "touching the deathless realm."

**La Vallée Poussin's Conclusion:**

* La Vallée Poussin argued that some early Buddhists, influenced by yogic practices, believed liberation could be achieved through deep meditative states.
* This view, he suggested, was not unique to Buddhism and resembled the Vedantic concept of mystic union with brahman.


**A Later Development?**

* The author suggests that the emphasis on "touching the deathless realm" and saññƗ*vedayitanirodha might be a later development in Buddhist thought.
* This view contrasts with the Buddha's dialogues with UpasƯva and PosƗla, which emphasize liberating insight rather than deep meditative trance.

## The Intellectual Tendency In Early Buddhism

* Some early Buddhists believed liberating insight could be achieved without meditation, suggesting an intellectual approach to enlightenment. This view is evident in texts like the MahƗ*-Cunda Sutta* and SusƯ*ma Sutta*.

* While some believed liberation came from pondering doctrinal teachings, others emphasized the importance of mindfulness and applying concentrative states to achieve insight.

* The Buddha taught a "middle way" between pure meditation and cognitive practices, stressing the need for insight gained through mindful awareness rather than solely focusing on non-cognition.

* The IndriyabhƗ*vana Sutta* criticizes a Brahminic teacher named PƗrƗsariya who advocated for suppressing sensory experience through meditation. This critique highlights the Buddha's emphasis on mindfulness and the potential influence of Vedic beliefs in the power of knowledge, contributing to the rise of intellectualism within early Buddhism.




## The Four Jhɨna-S **And Their Development**

* The text argues that the scheme of four jhƗ*na-s* is poorly understood and mistranslated.
* It proposes that *sati* and *upekkh*Ɨ, often translated as 'mindfulness' and 'equanimity,' have different meanings in early Buddhist texts.
* The author suggests that the third and fourth jhƗ*na-s* describe a process of directing meditative absorption towards mindful awareness of objects.

## Liberating Insight

* The text discusses the development of liberating insight in early Buddhism, noting that it is often described as an intellectual understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
* It argues that this intellectual conception likely developed later and that earlier conceptions were simpler and non-conceptual.
* The author cites the Buddha's dialogue with PosƗla as an example of a less intellectual understanding of liberating insight.

## The Origin of Buddhist Meditation

* This section explores the origins of Buddhist meditation, suggesting it was borrowed from early Brahminic practices.
* It argues that the Buddha himself was trained in these practices and allowed them to be used by his followers.
* The author proposes criteria for identifying authentic teachings of the Buddha based on historical facts deduced from early Buddhist literature.



## The Identification Of Authentic Teachings Of The Buddha

* One weakness of using historical facts to identify authentic teachings is the lack of direct connection between them in early Buddhist literature due to its oral nature.
* To address this, the author proposes a method based on deducing historical facts about the Buddha's life and intellectual development from texts like the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.

* This involves:
    * Establishing historical facts about the Buddha's life, particularly those related to his intellectual development.
    * Elaborating on the intellectual content of these facts.
    * Identifying dialogues in early literature where ideas discussed were important in the Buddha's intellectual development.
    * Analyzing if the Buddha's responses in these dialogues align with his hypothesized intellectual background.

* The author argues that this method can be used to identify authentic teachings, as demonstrated by analyzing the dialogue between the Buddha and UpasƯva.

* This approach involves:
    * Establishing the Buddha's training under Uddaka RƗmaputta and 
Árára Kalama based on the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.
    * Hypothesizing that these teachers taught a form of meditation similar to early Vedântic practices.
    * Analyzing the Buddha's rejection of UpasƯva's ideas, which align with his rejection of his teachers' goals.

* The author concludes that the dialogue with UpasƯva demonstrates the Buddha's "skill-in-means" and contains evidence suggesting its historical authenticity.

# Notes 
* This section mentions T.W.Rhys Davids' argument for the authenticity of long dialogues in the DƯgha NikƗya, which shares similarities with the author's method.

## 1 Introduction

* Discussions of doctrinal positions can be found in various scholarly works.
* Determining the exact chronology and authorship of Buddhist texts is challenging due to limitations of methods like higher criticism.
* Some scholars suggest that early Buddhist literature might date back to the Buddha, while others emphasize the need for a cautious approach.

## 2 The Arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka

* Erich Frauwallner's hypothesis suggests that Buddhism arrived in Sri Lanka through missionaries connected to AĞoka's court envoys around 250 BC.
* This hypothesis is supported by evidence from Buddhist stories and the Pāli canon.


## 3 The Pāli Canon and Other Texts

* The Pāli tradition incorporated literature from other sects but excluded it from the canon, as evidenced by the presence of non-canonical verses attributed to the Buddha in commentaries and other texts.
* Correspondences between the Pāli canon and other Buddhist texts (Sanskrit, Chinese, GandhƗran manuscripts) likely arose from shared origins rather than diffusion during a sectarian period.

## 4 Orientalist Interpretations of Buddhism

* Orientalists constructed an idealized image of Buddhism based on textual sources, which influenced their perception of Buddhism in the East.
* This idealized view contributed to a negative evaluation of Eastern Buddhist practices compared to the textual representations.

## 5 Modern Philological Approaches

* Modern philologists aim to understand Buddhist thought and context through deep analysis of language, history, institutions, and authorial milieu.
* This approach, termed "philological positivism," seeks to reconstruct the original text and author's intention.
* An alternative approach, "interpretivism," acknowledges the subjectivity inherent in textual interpretation and rejects the notion of a single definitive reconstruction.

## 6 Samādhi and Enstasis

* The term samādhi, often translated as "concentration" or "absorption," is sometimes rendered as "enstasis" by scholars like Mircea Eliade.
* This translation emphasizes the state of complete mental focus associated with samādhi.




## 2 And Uddaka Rɩmaputta

* This Sutta is called the PƗsarƗ*si Sutta* in some editions and the Ariyapariyesana Sutta in others.
* There are different accounts of this episode in various Buddhist texts, including the MahƯĞƗsaka and *Dharmaguptaka Vinayas,* as well as the Chinese SarvƗstivƗdin Snjtra.

* Scholars debate the historicity of the Buddha's training under Uddaka RƗmaputta and KƗlƗma.
* Some scholars believe that these teachers were likely non-Buddhist figures whose meditative practices were later adopted by Buddhism.
* Others argue that the entire story is a later fabrication, possibly based on common mystical devices practiced in ancient India.

* The Sutta describes Uddaka RƗmaputta as a teacher who instructed the Buddha in formless meditation.
* The text suggests that Uddaka RƗmaputta was living in *Kesamutta*, but other sources place him in different locations.
* There is some evidence to suggest that Uddaka RƗmaputta may have been a real historical figure, as he is mentioned in various Buddhist texts and even in the legendary material of Hiuen Tsang's *Si-Yu-Ki*.

* The Sutta depicts a dialogue between the Buddha and Uddaka RƗmaputta about the nature of enlightenment.
* It highlights the importance of direct experience and insight in attaining liberation.
* The text also suggests that Uddaka RƗmaputta recognized the Buddha's potential for enlightenment and acknowledged him as an equal.

* Some scholars have pointed out linguistic anomalies in the Sutta, suggesting that it may have undergone some changes over time.
* Despite these uncertainties, the story of Uddaka RƗmaputta remains a significant part of Buddhist tradition, offering insights into the Buddha's spiritual journey and the nature of enlightenment.

## Text Summary

**# The Bodhisattva's Liberation in Early Buddhist Texts**

* This section examines how the Buddha's liberation is described in early Buddhist texts, focusing on similarities and differences between accounts of his awakening and that of his first five disciples.

* Evidence suggests that attempts were made to ensure a relatively verbatim oral transmission of early Buddhist literature.

* The description of the Buddha's attainment of liberation in the *Anguttara Nikaya* (AN) is similar to the description of the five disciples' liberation, indicating that these accounts may be as old as each other.

**# Similes and Descriptions of Liberation**

* Similes used by the Bodhisattva during his meditation are mentioned, including one comparing his state to a lotus flower emerging from muddy water.
* The text discusses various descriptions of liberation found in different suttas, highlighting variations in wording and context.

**# The Simple Liberation Pericope**

* A specific pericope describing liberation is analyzed, noting its occurrence in various suttas and its application to both the Buddha and his disciples.
* This pericope seems to have been initially applied to both the Buddha and his disciples but later became exclusively associated with the Buddha's enlightenment.

**# The Development of the Pericope's Exclusivity**

* Evidence suggests that the simple liberation pericope was originally a general description of liberation, not specific to the Buddha.
* Over time, it became increasingly associated solely with the Buddha's awakening, possibly as part of efforts to elevate his status.

**# The Role of Jainism in Shaping Buddhist Thought**

* Some scholars argue that descriptions of the Bodhisattva's training under Uddaka RƗmaputta were anti-Jain propaganda aimed at discrediting Jain ascetic practices.
* This suggests a complex interplay between Buddhism and other religious traditions in shaping early Buddhist thought.

**# The Concept of Inclusivism**

* The concept of "inclusivism" is introduced, referring to the idea that different paths can lead to enlightenment.
* Early Buddhist texts often present multiple perspectives on the path to liberation, suggesting a degree of inclusivity.

**# Formless Meditation and Early Brahmanism**

* This section explores the relationship between formless meditation practices in early Buddhism and similar practices found in Brahmanical traditions.
* Similarities and differences are highlighted, shedding light on the shared intellectual landscape of these traditions.





## Summary of Text

### From 'this is calm, this is supreme' to 'the cessation of becoming is *nibb*Ɨna'.

* This section discusses various meditative objects mentioned in Buddhist texts and their possible origins.
* It analyzes lists of meditative objects found in the Pali Canon (D III.135.9; S III.203.12ff., III.213.30ff., III.214.20, III.216.20, IV.73.4; A II.23.30, II.25.21; Ud 8.6; It 121.17) and compares them with similar lists found in other sources like the MahƗbhƗrata (Mbh XII).
* The author suggests that these lists might have originated from Brahminic circles and were later adopted by Buddhist tradition.

###  The Meaning of *Krtsna*.

* This section explores the meaning of the word *krtsna*, which appears in various contexts related to meditation.
* It examines different interpretations of the term found in dictionaries like DOP, PED, CPD, MMW, and BR.
* The author suggests that *krtsna* might be derived from *krtsna* and discusses its possible connection to other Sanskrit words.

###  The Significance of *Krtsna* in Meditation.

* This section analyzes the role of *krtsna* as a meditative object in Buddhist texts.
* It cites examples from various suttas (D II.110.5ff., D III.260.8ff., M II.14.1ff., A IV.305.1ff., A V.61.3ff.) and discusses the attainment of *bhƗ*veti* through meditation on *krtsna*.

###  The Concept of *Jagat* in Buddhist and Hindu Texts.

* This section compares the usage of the term *jagat* (world) in Buddhist and Hindu texts.
* It cites examples from the Bhagavad GItƗ (BhG VII.6: X.42: XI.7, 13), MahƗbhƗrata (Mbh XII.305.21), and other sources.
* The author analyzes different interpretations of *jagat* as something whole, unborn, auspicious, intransient, perpetual, and hard to attain by normal people.

###  The Concept of *Jagat* in the MahƗbhƗrata.

* This section focuses on the concept of *jagat* as described in the MahƗbhƗrata (Mbh XII).
* It analyzes passages from Mbh XII.195, 197, 224, and 228, which discuss the creation of the world and the role of *yoga* in understanding its nature.
* The author suggests that the MahƗbhƗrata presents a cyclical view of the universe where everything originates from a first principle and returns to it.

###  The Relationship between *Yoga* and the Concept of *Jagat*.

* This section explores the connection between *yoga* practices and the understanding of *jagat* in the MahƗbhƗrata.
* It analyzes passages that describe the stages of *yoga* and their relation to the spheres or entities involved in the creation process.
* The author suggests that *yoga* allows individuals to recapitulate the creation process in reverse order and attain a state of unity with the ultimate reality (BrahmƗ).

###  The Significance of Uddaka RƗmaputta's Teaching.


* This section discusses the teachings of Uddaka RƗmaputta, a pre-Buddhist ascetic who influenced the Buddha.
* It analyzes his famous saying "seeing and seeing not" and its possible meaning in the context of Buddhist meditation.
* The author suggests that Uddaka's teaching might have been a precursor to the later Buddhist concept of *sunyata* (emptiness).

## The Philosophy Of Early Brahminic Yoga

**# 4 The Philosophy Of Early Brahminic Yoga**

* Meditation seems to be suggested at BU IV.4.23, although Bronkhorst (1993:112) thinks that this passage is 'later than the beginnings of Buddhism'. In any case, it is not evidence for any sort of 'cosmological' meditation. 
* The reading prƗ*ptir* in pƗda d) is unclear. The verse describes how the formless absolute emits the first creation, but some of the adjectives in the nominative case have variants in the accusative (e.g. ), and some adjectives in the accusative case have variants in the nominative (e.g. ƯĞƗno, ). Moreover, the masculine accusative adjective agrees with whose gender is usually neuter. The variants probably indicate that opinion on the status of the creator and the first creation differed. Other variants such as and *jyotim* show that the verse was simply misunderstood. At least the process of creation is clear enough, even if the theological issues are not.

* See p. 42 n. 62.
* This is indicated when the Buddha tells the five disciples that his doctrine is to be practised just as he teaches it (M I.172.34: *desemi, tath*Ɨ). 
* It belongs to the *Khuddaka Nik*Ɨya. The introductory verses to the PƗrƗ*yanavagga* (Sn 976–1031: *Vatthug*ƗthƗ) are not commented on in the *Niddesa,* and were probably not originally part of the text (see Norman's note, 2001:395).

* Norman (2001:xxix). De Jong (2000:173): '[I]t would be hazardous to rely too much on metrical grounds for distinguishing older and newer verses.' 
* Norman (2001:xxxiii): 'Nevertheless, the fact that what we can, on other grounds, consider to be the original core of verses in the is in metre, which is generally a sign of an early composition in PƗli, supports the argument that the is old.' 
* Norman (2001:xxxiii–iv). Schmithausen (1992:113 n. 18) notes the differences of opinion on these identifications; see also Hultzsch (1991:174 n. 1).

## # Notes on Nibbana

* The term "nibbana" appears in various contexts, including the DutiyardƗ*a Sutta and other suttas.
* It is associated with the cessation of suffering (dukkha), craving (tanhƗ), and ignorance (avijjƗ).
* A living person can attain nibbana, as indicated by a verse found in the Itivuttaka.

## # The Meaning of Nibbana

* Nibbana is described as a state of being free from attachment, aversion, and delusion.
* It is characterized by peace, tranquility, and liberation.
* The term "brahmabhnjtena attanƗ viharati" suggests an analogy to the Brahminic concept of merging with Brahman, but in Buddhism, it signifies a metaphorical transcendence rather than literal absorption.

## #  Nibbana and Meditation

* Several suttas describe meditative states leading to nibbana, such as the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.
* The term "dhamma" can refer to both meditative objects and teachings.
* The Sutta Nipata contains verses that depict nibbana as a state of going out or being released from suffering.

## #  Nibbana and the Self

* Some scholars, like Pérez-Remón, argue that the use of "brahmabhnjtena attanƗ viharati" implies a belief in an Ɨ*tman*.
* However, others suggest that it is a metaphorical expression for attaining liberation without clinging to a permanent self.

## #  Nibbana and Insight

* The Sutta Nipata verses 1105-1115 describe a person who has attained a meditative state of nothingness (Ɨ*kiñcañña*) and the Buddha's ability to know their condition.
* These verses highlight the role of insight in understanding and attaining nibbana.

## #  Stations of Consciousness

* The concept of "stations of consciousness" encompasses both meditative states and ethical attitudes of mind, influencing destinies after death.
* Insight into the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and non-self nature of these stations is crucial for liberation.

## Conclusion

* The text discusses different interpretations of liberating insight in Buddhism.
* It examines the role of meditation and intellectual understanding in achieving liberation.
* The author analyzes various suttas and commentaries to support their arguments.
* They highlight discrepancies between early Buddhist teachings and later interpretations.
* The text concludes that the concept of liberating insight evolved over time, with different schools emphasizing different aspects.
