# Buddhism In The Shadow Of Brahmanism

By Johannes Bronkhorst

* This book examines the relationship between Buddhism and Brahmanism.
* It argues that Buddhism was not a direct reaction against Vedic Brahmanism, as is often claimed.
* Instead, it suggests that Brahmins did not hold a dominant position in the region where Buddhism originated.

# Preface

* The author acknowledges the contributions of various institutions and individuals who supported his research.
* He mentions that parts of this book have been previously published or are in press.
* He expresses gratitude to his wife, Joy Manné, for her support.

## 2 Chapter One

* **The dating of the Buddha's death:**
    * Scholars previously believed the Buddha died around 480 BCE.
    * Current scholarship favors a date closer to 400 BCE, give or take a few decades.
    * This date precedes Alexander the Great's invasion of India and the rise of the Nanda and Mauryan empires.

* **Brahmanization of the Ganges Valley:**
    * Patañjali (c. 150 BCE) defined "Aryavarta" as the Ganges plain, excluding the eastern region.
    * The *Manava Dharmasastra* (2nd-3rd century CE) expanded Aryavarta to include the entire subcontinent.
    * This suggests a eastward spread of Brahmanical influence between these periods.

* **Greater Magadha:**
    * A term used to describe the eastern Ganges valley, where Buddhism originated.
    * Not considered brahmanical territory until around 185 BCE with the rise of the Sungas dynasty.
    * Encompassed the region where the Buddha and Mahavira lived and taught.

## Introduction 3

* **Brahmanism vs. Buddhism:**
    * Brahmanism is characterized by the claim of Brahmin superiority, which must be accepted for a region to be considered brahmanical.
    * Greater Magadha was likely not brahmanical during the Buddha's time, suggesting a distinct cultural and religious landscape.

* **Political history of Greater Magadha:**
    * Early rulers (Bimbisara, Ajatasatru, Nandas) were not particularly aligned with Brahmanism.
    * Candragupta Maurya embraced Jainism, while his successors patronized non-brahmanical movements like Ajivikism.

* **Significance of Greater Magadha:**
    * Served as a crucible for various religious and spiritual movements, including Buddhism and Jainism.
    * Possessed a unique cultural identity distinct from the Brahmanical heartland.

## 4 Chapter One

* **Greater Magadha's culture:**
    * Experienced urbanization from around 500 BCE onward.
    * Developed distinctive funerary practices involving stūpas, precursors to Buddhist monuments.

* **Shared spiritual ideology:**
    * Belief in rebirth and karmic retribution was prevalent across various religious currents.
    * Different interpretations existed on how to escape karmic consequences.

## Introduction 5

* **Jainism's approach to liberation:**
    * Advocated for extreme asceticism, including complete cessation of all activity (bodily and mental).
    * Believed that abstaining from action would prevent new karma and negate the effects of past deeds.
    * This radical approach aimed to achieve liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

* **Knowledge of the self:**
    * A concept prevalent in Greater Magadha, suggesting that the true self is inactive and unaffected by actions.
    * Offered an alternative path to liberation by recognizing the distinction between the self and the body/mind.
    * This idea resonated with both Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical traditions.

## 1.2 Interactions

* **Understanding Buddhism:**
    * Knowledge of Greater Magadha's cultural and spiritual context sheds light on Buddhist teachings.
    * The concept of an inactive self, prevalent in the region, resonates with Buddhist philosophy.

## Introduction 7
* Sentient beings, according to some ideas prevalent in Greater Magadha, do not participate in actions and are therefore exempt from karmic retribution.
* Early Buddhist thought was acquainted with this notion but did not accept it.
* The Buddha taught that the five constituents of a person (body, feeling, perception, habitual tendencies, and consciousness) are impermanent, painful, and subject to change, making them unsuitable candidates for a permanent self.

## 8 Chapter One
* Early Buddhists were familiar with the concept of an unchanging, pleasurable self, but they did not consider it essential for liberation.
* The Buddha's path to enlightenment does not emphasize knowledge of the true self.
* Buddhism differed from other religious movements in Greater Magadha by rejecting both the notion of an inactive self and ascetic practices aimed at immobilising body and mind.

## Introduction 9
* The Buddhist canon contains a mix of authentic Buddhist teachings and ideas borrowed from other religious currents.
* Some converts to Buddhism brought with them beliefs and practices that did not align with the Buddha's vision.
* By comparing Buddhist teachings with those of other movements in Greater Magadha, we can identify borrowings and distinguish authentic Buddhist ideas.

## 10 Chapter One
* The method of identifying authentic Buddhist teachings involves considering both rejected and recommended ideas within the canon and their correspondence to cultural and religious features of Greater Magadha.
* This approach allows for the possibility that early Buddhism introduced innovative ideas while acknowledging shared beliefs with other movements, such as the belief in rebirth and karmic retribution.
* The question of the original teaching of the Buddha is complex and requires careful analysis and a willingness to consider serious hypotheses.

## Introduction 11

* This chapter explores the unique nature of Buddha's teachings compared to other prevalent beliefs at the time.
* Scholars have debated whether Buddhism was truly novel or a variation of existing practices like Yoga.
* Evidence suggests that classical Yoga, while sharing some similarities with Buddhism, developed centuries later and was influenced by it.

## 12 Chapter One 1.3 Imperial Help

* The political landscape during Buddha's time consisted of several small states in the region known as Greater Magadha.
* Magadha emerged as a dominant power, eventually becoming a vast empire under the Nanda and Maurya dynasties.
* Both dynasties were generally tolerant towards religions prevalent in Greater Magadha, primarily Jainism and Ājīvikism.

## Introduction 13

* Aśoka, the grandson of Candragupta Maurya, converted to Buddhism but did not impose it as a state religion.
* His inscriptions emphasize "Dharma," which encompasses moral principles like non-violence, respect for elders, and generosity.
* Aśoka's Dharma is distinct from Buddhist teachings, though sharing some similarities with Jainism.
* He actively promoted his concept of Dharma throughout his empire and beyond, advocating for harmony among different religious groups.

## 14 Chapter One

* Aśoka's policies impacted Brahmins by prohibiting animal sacrifices, a central practice in Vedic rituals.
* Despite respecting Brahmins, Aśoka did not involve them in the administration of his empire.

## 16 Chapter One

* The text discusses the spread of religions in India during the Mauryan empire.
* It suggests that Jainism and Ājīvikism may have initially benefited more from the empire's unity than Buddhism.
* Aśoka's patronage likely gave Buddhism a significant boost, although he also imposed restrictions on Brahmanism.

## Introduction 17

* The text explores how the Mauryan empire facilitated the spread of religions originating in Greater Magadha.
* It suggests that Aśoka's generosity towards Buddhists may have contributed to changes within the organization of Buddhism itself.
*  Aśoka's inscription at Lumbinī, donating the village to its inhabitants rather than a Buddhist monastery, is analyzed as possible evidence for the early stage of Buddhist monasticism.

## 18 Chapter One

* The text discusses the implications of Aśoka's donation at Lumbinī for the development of Buddhist monasticism.
* It suggests that this inscription may indicate that organized monasteries did not yet exist during Aśoka's reign.
* The text mentions later donations to Buddhist monasteries by Anāthapiṇḍika and King Bimbisāra, highlighting a shift in Buddhist practices.

## Introduction 19

* The text explores the historical context of land grants to Buddhist monasteries.
* It suggests that these donations played a significant role in Buddhism's development and involvement in political and social issues.

## 20 Chapter One

* The text discusses the spread of religions from Greater Magadha, particularly Jainism, within the Mauryan empire.
* It highlights the importance of regions like Sri Lanka and Gandhāra for the preservation and development of Buddhism.

## Introduction 21

* The text introduces the Achaemenid empire and its influence on northwestern India.
* It describes Alexander the Great's conquest and the subsequent presence of Greek colonists in the region.
* The text emphasizes the lasting cultural impact of the Greeks, even after their political power waned.

## Chapter One

* This chapter discusses the unique intellectual environment faced by Buddhists who settled in Greater Gandhāra, a region ruled by Indo-Greeks after the fall of the Maurya empire.
* The absence of Brahmins and Śramaṇas forced these Buddhists to develop their own distinct interpretations of Buddhist doctrine.
* They created an elaborate ontology based on *dharma*s, claiming that these are the only truly existing entities.

* This ontology posits a thoroughgoing atomism, with composite objects consisting of indivisible *dharma*s and time being a succession of momentary instants.
* The Buddhists argued that ordinary objects are merely collections of *dharma*s and that words create the illusion of their existence.

* While this new philosophy claimed to be rooted in traditional Buddhist concepts, it represented a radical departure from earlier interpretations.
* The chapter suggests that the confrontation with Greek philosophical traditions, particularly the emphasis on debate and logical coherence, may have influenced these developments.

## Chapter Two Brahmanism

* This chapter explores how Brahmanism adapted and thrived despite facing challenges during the Mauryan empire.
* Aśoka's policies, while respectful of Brahmins, undermined their traditional role in local governance and ritual practices.
* The centralized Maurya administration replaced local kings who had relied on Brahmin priests for support.

* Aśoka's ban on animal sacrifices further weakened traditional Brahmanism.
* Despite these setbacks, Brahmanism underwent a transformation, ultimately achieving widespread influence across South and Southeast Asia.
* This chapter emphasizes the need to understand these changes in Brahmanism to grasp its subsequent impact on Buddhism.

## 2.1 The New Brahmanism

* Vedic Brahmanism was not the background out of which Buddhism arose.
* It had its heartland west of Greater Magadha and did not provide the ideological and religious background against which the Buddha preached.
* Inevitably, Buddhism and Vedic Brahmanism came into contact with profound consequences for both.
* For Buddhism, it meant a long drawn-out confrontation that ended in its almost complete disappearance from the subcontinent.

## Primary and Secondary Religions

* The German Egyptologist Jan Assmann distinguishes between primary and secondary religions.
* Primary religions are linked to one single culture, society, and language, while secondary religions have universal claims.
* Primary religions do not have exclusive truth claims, unlike secondary religions.

## Universal Claims of Greater Magadha Religions

* The religions of Greater Magadha may be considered secondary religions in the sense that they have universal claims.
* These are not primarily truth claims like those found in monotheistic religions.
* Aśoka's universal claim was a moral one, wanting to spread Dharma to all people.
* Buddhism and Jainism claimed to present the only way to liberation from the cycle of rebirths.

## Vedic Brahmanism as a Primary Religion

* Vedic Brahmanism was at first a primary religion, closely linked to a single culture, society, and language.
* It had close association with rulers, providing ritual services.
* It did not have exclusive truth claims or try to make converts.

## Reinvention of Vedic Brahmanism

* Traditional vedic society declined, likely due to the rise of new empires like Nanda and Maurya.
* Without support from rulers, Vedic Brahmanism had to reinvent itself.
* Brahmins broadened their services beyond ritual sacrifices, offering counsel in statecraft and governing.
* They claimed a high position in society and possessed secret powers.

## The Spread and Acceptance of Brahmins

* Aśoka's inscription mentions Brahmins and Śramaṇas in all countries except among the Greeks.
* This does not necessarily mean they were present everywhere, but suggests some presence.
* Aśoka and others respected Brahmins but did not give them the privileged place they aspired to.
* The *Mahābhārata* and *Mānava Dharmaśāstra* suggest that some peoples became Śūdras because no Brahmins were seen among them.

# The Role of Brahmins in Regions Where Their Vision of Society Was Not Recognized

* The editors of the Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Sanskrit propose a special meaning for *adarśana*, "not seeing", to explain why the Greeks and others were said to have neglected Brahmins, leading to their downfall.
* This interpretation is likely inspired by the prior conviction that there were Brahmins among all peoples mentioned.

# Occupations of Brahmins in Non-Brahmanized Regions

* The early Buddhist canon provides valuable information about the role of Brahmins in regions where Brahmanical influence was weak or non-existent.
* The Buddhist canon describes society primarily as consisting of "householders" (*gahapati*), without internal distinctions, suggesting a social structure different from the four *varṇas*.

# Brahminical Vision of Society in the Buddhist Canon

* The Buddhist canon rarely refers to the Brahmanical vision of society, which divides people into four *varṇas*: Brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras.
* The *gahapati*, often associated with merchants or guild leaders, is not assimilated to the Vaiśya, indicating a distinction between the Buddhist understanding of social structure and the Brahmanical one.

# Brahminical Concepts in the Buddhist Canon

* Discourses that mention the Brahmanical *varṇas* often involve conversations between the Buddha and Brahmins, challenging their claims of superiority.
* The *Assalāyana Sutta*, for example, argues against the existence of the four *varṇas* among the Greeks, suggesting a later composition date after Alexander's invasion.

# Two Characteristic Brahminical Positions in Society

* Asita, the "Buddhist Simeon," exemplifies Brahmins as predictors of the future, a role likely developed after Aśoka's reign.
* Varsākāra, presented as King Ajātaśatru's minister, represents Brahmins occupying positions of political influence, possibly reflecting later Brahmanization trends.

# The Purohita in the Buddhist Canon

* The Purohita, or "royal chaplain," is a significant figure in the Brahmanical vision but appears infrequently in the Buddhist canon.
* Discourses featuring the Purohita often criticize his role in performing sacrifices and perpetuating disreputable activities, suggesting a reaction to Brahmanical influence after the Buddha's death.

# The Changing Role of Brahmins in Ancient India

* Some canonical texts dealing with brahmanical ideas and practices appear to be relatively late additions.
* Buddhist canon often mentions Brahmins, even those engaged in typically brahmanical activities, but presents them living in a fundamentally non-brahmanical world. 
* The creation of empire in northern India led to changed political circumstances for Brahmins.

# Adapting to New Circumstances

* Some Brahmins moved beyond areas where they might hope to be employed as priests and offered services adjusted to the new environment.
* They could not expect to perform major Vedic sacrifices, but adapted by emphasizing their skills in interpreting signs, predicting the future, and giving counsel to rulers.

# The Legend of Cāṇakya / Kautilya

* This legend illustrates Brahmins' insistence on their practical skills in matters politic.
* It portrays a Brahmin minister creating an empire for his king, highlighting the importance of finding a suitable brahmanical counsellor.

# Advice for Kings

* Brahmins created a literature offering advice to rulers, including descriptions of how kings should behave and examples of righteous kings.
* The *Mahābhārata*, *Rāmāyaṇa*, and *Bhagavadgītā* played a role in this legitimation of war and governance.
* Treatises like the *Arthaśāstra* and *Mānava Dharmaśāstra* provided direct advice on wealth, virtue, and the pursuit of pleasure.

# Imposing the Brahmanical Vision

* Brahmins aimed to impose their vision of a hierarchically ordered society with Brahmins at the top.
* Early non-brahmanical sources do not use this terminology, but Buddhist texts occasionally acknowledge it while rejecting the division.

# Subtle Adoption of Brahmanical Ideas

* The adoption of brahmanical terminology was a subtle way for others to begin accepting their ideas.
* Discussions shifted from total rejection of the fourfold division of society to questions about which group was highest.

#  Brahminical Influence without Conversion

* Brahmins did not seek conversion in the usual sense but reminded rulers of supposed facts about society and the role of Brahmins.
* Rulers could support Brahmins through donations or tax exemptions without fully embracing their ideology.
* King Rudradāman's inscription is an example of a ruler adopting the brahmanical vision of society without performing Vedic sacrifices.

## 2.2 The Spread Of Sanskrit

* Sanskrit spread throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia due to Brahmanism, not its linguistic nature.
* Nicholas Ostler's *Empires of the Word* argues that Sanskrit became a world language due to its role as a lingua franca for trade, international business, and cultural promotion. 
* The book compares Sanskrit's spread to the global embrace of American culture in the late 20th century.

* The spread of Sanskrit is distinct from the spread of other Indo-Aryan languages.
* Sanskrit inscriptions appear centuries after inscriptions in other Indo-Aryan languages.
* Sheldon Pollock argues that Sanskrit became the primary language of political expression in South and Southeast Asia, forming a "Sanskrit cosmopolis" between 300 and 1300 CE.

* Pollock rejects Ostler's theory, stating that Sanskrit was not a lingua franca for everyday communication or trade.
* Sanskrit spread through intellectuals and religious professionals who carried diverse texts of various religious orders.

# The Spread of Sanskrit

* Pollock argues that Sanskrit functioned as a medium of "aesthetic power" rather than material power in politics.
* He suggests a "Sanskrit cosmopolis" existed around 1000 CE, characterized by elites across Southeast Asia and India sharing a common cultural and political outlook through their mastery of Sanskrit poetry.

# Pollock's Rejection of the Brahmanism-Sanskrit Link

* Pollock criticizes the notion that Brahmins were solely responsible for spreading Sanskrit as a means of "legitimation."
* He points to examples like the Sātavāhanas, a dynasty with strong brahmanical ties but who didn't use Sanskrit in non-ritual contexts.
* He argues that the spread of Sanskrit was driven by its aesthetic qualities and ability to make "translocal claims," rather than being solely linked to Brahmins.

# Questions about the Connection between Sanskrit and Brahmanism

* The author questions Pollock's dismissal of the connection between Sanskrit and Brahmins, noting ample evidence of Brahmins' presence in regions where Sanskrit spread.
* They argue that while "legitimation" might not be the sole reason for Brahmins' presence, their role cannot be ignored.
* The author suggests that the spread of Brahmanism (as the acceptance of Brahmins as eminent members of society) and the spread of Sanskrit were likely interconnected phenomena.




# The Role of Brahmins in Southeast Asia

* Brahmins did not convert populations to Vedic religion but rather established a social order where they held the highest position due to their knowledge of the supernatural.
* This knowledge was often kept secret, giving them power over kingdoms and rulers.
* Over time, Brahmins convinced rulers to provide them with resources to carry out their rites and benefit the kingdom.

# Evidence from Inscriptions

* The oldest known inscriptions in Indonesia mention Brahmins performing sacrifices for kings.
* A Sanskrit inscription in West Java records a king gifting 1000 cows to Brahmins.
* In Cambodia, Brahmins held a powerful hierarchy and enjoyed a privileged position similar to that in India.
* They were involved in royal ceremonies and even had alliances with the royal family through marriage.

# Brahmins as Advisors and Priests

* Brahmins served as priests, teachers, ministers, and counselors to Southeast Asian rulers.
* The *purohita*, a chief priest, held significant influence and often advised multiple generations of kings.
* They conducted important ceremonies, including royal consecrations, even in Buddhist courts.

# Origins and Nature of Brahmanism

* While some Brahmins may have come from India, the majority were likely Southeast Asians who learned Sanskrit texts and rituals in Indian ashrams.
* Brahmanism should be understood as a social order rather than a religion.
* It provided a sense of unity and place for communities through its rituals and social structure.

# The Spread of Sanskrit and Brahmins

* The spread of Sanskrit was closely linked to the spread of Brahmanical institutions.
* Brahmins, with their knowledge of Sanskrit and ritualistic practices, played a key role in legitimizing rulers and organizing societies in South and Southeast Asia.
* The example of Sri Lanka shows that even in a predominantly Buddhist country, Brahmins and Sanskrit influenced governance due to the lack of alternative models.

#  Brahminical Influence Beyond Religion

* While Buddhism coexisted with Brahmanism in Southeast Asia, the influence of Brahmins extended beyond religious practices.
* The brahmanical vision of society, with its hierarchical caste system, was adopted by rulers like Rudradāman, even those not strictly aligned with Brahmanism.

#  The Role of Sanskrit

* While Sanskrit's initial political use may predate strong Brahmanical influence, the language became closely associated with Brahmanical institutions and practices.
* The inscription of Rudradāman demonstrates that even rulers who were not explicitly "brahmanical" adopted the brahmanical vision of society and used Sanskrit to legitimize their actions.

#  Conclusion

* It is difficult to separate the spread of Sanskrit from the spread of Brahmins, as both were integral to the dissemination of Brahmanical ideas and practices.
* While Buddhism coexisted with Brahmanism in some regions, the influence of Brahmins and their vision of society was pervasive.

# 2.2 The Brahmanical Colonization Of The Present

* Promoting Sanskrit was a way for rulers to legitimize themselves and gain favor with Brahmins.
* This practice was adopted by foreign rulers like Scythians and Kushans who wanted to align themselves with the priestly class.
* Respect for Brahmins in South and Southeast Asia should not be mistaken for conversion to Brahmanism.

# 2.3 The Brahmanical Colonization Of The Past

* Brahmanism reinvented itself, becoming a socio-political ideology focused on establishing Brahmin superiority.
* This included securing privileged positions in areas related to the supernatural, such as divination, protection rituals, and healing.
* Brahmins also advised rulers on societal and political matters.
* To achieve these goals, they adopted new lifestyles and composed literary works aimed at both Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical audiences.

# The Maurya Empire and the Legend of Cāṇakya

* The Maurya empire posed a challenge to traditional Brahmanism but was later reinterpreted as being created by a Brahmin minister, Cāṇakya.
* This tradition is likely propagandistic, aiming to emphasize the importance of Brahmin advisors for rulers.
* The *Arthaśāstra*, attributed to Kautilya (possibly another name for Cāṇakya), provides insights into statecraft but its authorship and composition are debated.



# Multiple Authorship and Dating

* The *Arthaśāstra* likely has multiple authors.
* Statistical analysis supports this theory.
* The text's current form is much younger than Candragupta Maurya's time.
* Some scholars date it between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE.
* Michael Willis argues for a 4th-century CE dating based on Kāmandaki's *Nītisāra*.

# Brahminical Authorship

* Attributing authorship to Candragupta Maurya's minister is improbable.
* No writing existed in India during his reign.
* The *Arthaśāstra* assumes a kingdom surrounded by rivals, unlike Candragupta's empire.
* Brahmins may have claimed credit to enhance their status.

# The Prakaraṇa-Text

* Mark McClish suggests an older core of the *Arthaśāstra* existed without Brahmanical ideology.
* This "prakaraṇa-text" was later infused with religious elements.
* McClish believes this text is not anti-Brahmanical but assumes a privileged position for Brahmins.

# The Arthaśāstra and the Maurya Empire

* The *prakaran*̣a-text doesn't reflect the organization of the Maurya empire.
* It represents an early attempt by Brahmins to develop a statecraft treatise.
* Brahmanism likely reinvented itself in response to the political changes brought by the Maurya empire.

# Alternative Sources

* Megasthenes, a Greek visitor, provides valuable insights into Candragupta's reign.
* His account of seven social classes suggests Magadha was not yet brahmanized.

# Brahmanical Reconstruction of History

* The traditional narrative surrounding Candragupta and Cāṇakya is heavily influenced by Brahmins.
* This narrative projects a desired image of Brahmins in governance.
* Even Buddhists accepted this narrative, demonstrating the pervasiveness of Brahmanical influence.




## 2.4 The Brahmanization Of Borrowed Features

* Brahmanism sought to establish a distinct identity through codes of behavior that set Brahmins apart as exemplary figures worthy of imitation or respect.
* Literature from the period around the beginning of the Common Era, such as Dharma and Gṛhya-sūtras, focused on outlining appropriate behavior for Brahmins.

##  Brahmanical Hermitages: An Adaptation

* Brahmanism adopted the concept of hermitages (*āśrama*s) as a response to the shelters created for ascetic members of religions like Jainism, Ājīvikas, and Buddhism.
* Initially, these shelters provided refuge during the rainy seasons and later received land or village revenue for upkeep and sustenance.

##  Brahmanical Hermitages vs. Monasteries

* Brahmanical hermitages are depicted as idyllic retreats in literature, contrasting with monasteries which were often associated with spiritual pursuits and attracted donations from the wealthy.
* The play *Abhijñānaśākuntala* by Kālidāsa portrays a typical brahmanical hermitage where deer roam freely, indicating a peaceful and secluded environment.

##  Origins and Evolution of Brahmanical Hermitages

* Brahmanical hermitages are not mentioned in Vedic texts but appear frequently in later epics like the *Mahābhārata* and the *Rāmāyan*̣a.
* Romila Thapar suggests that hermitages may have evolved into *agrahāra*s, tax-free land grants for Brahmins, during the post-Gupta period.

##  Brahmanical Hermitages and Agrahāras: Two Sides of the Same Coin?

* The *Arthaśāstra* mentions two types of land grants: *brahmadeya*s (for past services) and grants to ascetics (*tapasvin*) for religious practices.
* Both types of grants could benefit Brahmins, who were expected to continue their Vedic studies and rituals regardless of the grant type.

##  Buddhist Perspective on Brahmanical Hermitages

* Buddhist texts distinguish between wealthy Brahmins who received *brahmadeya*s and ascetic Brahmins living in *āśrama*s.
* However, this distinction may be blurred as both types were involved in Vedic rituals and knowledge transmission.




# The Five Mahāyajñas

* The five *mahāyajñas* are specified in the *Mānava Dharmaśāstra*.
* They are: teaching, quenching libation, burnt offering, Bali offering, and honouring guests.
* Providing for these sacrifices is a common purpose of donations.

# Donations to Brahmins

* Donations of land to Brahmins were common in ancient India.
* Inscriptions often specify the purposes for which the land was granted.
* These purposes included supporting Vedic study, performing sacrifices, teaching, and providing for priests.
* The link between sacrifices and the well-being of political power is clear from many inscriptions.

# Agrahāras as Spiritual Investments

* Gifts of land to Brahmins were seen as spiritual investments.
* Brahmins depicted life in their settlements (*āśrama*) as profoundly religious.
* This helped to entice rulers to create more such settlements.

# The Relationship Between *Agrahāras* and *Āśramas*

* It is possible that *agrahāra*s and *āśramas* were two different institutions with considerable overlap.
* *Agrahāra*s were donated to Brahmins because their donors expected them to live in accordance with the ideals of *āśrama* life.
* Brahmins depicted *āśramas* in a particular manner to attract donations from rulers.

# Evidence for Agrahāras in Early Texts

* The term *agrahāra* appears in the *Mahābhārata*, suggesting that the institution existed at an early date.
* The *Mahābhārata* also mentions land donations and their benefits, which were closely associated with *agrahāra*s.

# Land Grants in Ancient India

* The Rāmāyaṇa states that giving land leads to the highest destiny.
* Several passages in Vedic and auxiliary literature refer to land grants.
* Some texts express disapproval of land grants, while others are more accepting.
* The term "grāmakāma" (one who desires a village) appears frequently in Vedic literature.

# Brahmins and Land Grants

* Dharmasūtras stipulate that giving land to Brahmins is meritorious.
* The Śāṅkhāyana, Kausītaka, and Pāraskara Gṛhyasūtra state that a village is the optional gift for a Rājanya (ruler).
* Inscriptions from the first century BCE onwards mention gifts of villages to Brahmins.

# Villages as Part of Land Grants

* The Nānāghāt inscriptions mention the donation of a village alongside other gifts to Brahmins.
* King Nahapāna gave sixteen villages to gods and Brahmins.
* An inscription from Nāsik shows that land grants often implied the involvement of villagers who worked the land.
* A fourth-century CE inscription specifies the names of family members who ploughed the granted land.

# Brahmins and Agriculture

* The Mānava Dharmaśāstra advises avoiding those who live from agriculture, suggesting Brahmins should not till the land themselves.
* However, there are exceptions, such as the Ghugrāhāti copper-plate inscription which mentions a Brahmin requesting land to settle on and cultivate.

# Brahmanical Settlements and Land Grants

* There are reasons to believe that the *āśrama*s described in brahmanical literature were idealized depictions of brahmanical settlements.
* These idealized depictions likely served political purposes, encouraging rulers to grant land to Brahmins.
* The idea was that by creating such settlements, kings could harness brahmanical power for their own benefit.

# The Power of Brahmins

* The *Rāmāyaṇa* and *Mahābhārata* depict Brahmins as possessing great spiritual power.
* These epics suggest that kings should be wary of angering Brahmins, as they could bring misfortune upon them.
* The *Mānava Dharmaśāstra* emphasizes the destructive potential of angered Brahmins.

# Origins of Brahmanical *Āśrama*s

* The practice of land grants likely predates the Vedic period and was not exclusive to Brahmins.
* Buddhists, Jainas, and Ājīvikas also received land donations for their monasteries and ascetics.
* Brahmins may have adopted the concept of *āśrama*s to compete for land grants and establish themselves as powerful religious figures.

# Competition for Land Grants

* The competition for land grants among different religious groups likely spurred the development of *āśrama*s.
* By creating communities of ascetics, Brahmins could present themselves as deserving recipients of land donations.
* Cave inscriptions from Karle and Nasik provide evidence of villages being donated to support ascetics living in caves.

# Chapter Three Buddhism Confronted With Brahmanism

* Brahmins had several advantages over Buddhists in competing for royal support. They were already involved in affairs of state and had clear ideas about society and governance.
* Buddhists, to be heard at court, needed to develop their own ideas about society, governance, war, and peace. This was a daunting challenge as Buddhism initially focused on escaping rebirth rather than societal structures.

# 3.1 A Courtly Challenge

* The Buddhist *Aggañña Sutta* criticizes the Brahminical vision of society, rejecting the notion of inherent differences between castes. It presents an alternative creation story emphasizing common ancestry but accepts the existing caste division and kingly authority.
* Buddhism's emphasis on liberation through non-violence clashed with the use of violence by rulers. While Brahmins could justify violence as a duty for warriors, Buddhists struggled to reconcile this with their core teachings.
* The story of an outcast refusing to execute a criminal highlights the Buddhist rejection of killing, implying that even kings should not order executions.

* This conundrum led Buddhist thinkers to explore the possibility of righteous rule without violence, inspired by the legend of Emperor Aśoka and his "victory of Dharma."
* The *Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta* describes a righteous king conquering the world through non-violence, guided by a Wheel-Treasure.

* Buddhist advisors to kings faced difficulties in providing practical advice on ruling without violence. Mātṛceta's letter to King Kaniska emphasizes saving animal lives but says nothing about human killing.
* Nāgārjuna's *Precious Garland* suggests that merit, not conquest, leads to becoming a Universal Monarch, implying the possibility of non-violent rule.

# The Buddhist Perspective on Kingship

* Buddhism offered little practical advice on statecraft and governance.
* Some Buddhist texts suggest that kingship is inherently problematic and leads to suffering.
* They argue that the duties and responsibilities of a king often conflict with Buddhist principles.
*  Buddhist authors like Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Candrakīrti, and Aśvaghosa expressed reservations about the nature of kingship.

# The Role of Brahmins in Governance

* Buddhists generally avoided occupations related to divination, astrology, and statecraft, leaving these domains to Brahmins.
* This division of labor allowed Brahmins to maintain their influence in royal courts even in Buddhist kingdoms.
* Examples from Southeast Asia demonstrate that Brahmins continued to play significant roles as advisors and ritual specialists under Buddhist rulers.

# Buddhism's Limited Engagement with Political Power

*  Buddhism focused on individual spiritual development rather than actively shaping political systems.
* While Buddhists might have advised kings on ethical matters, they did not seek to provide comprehensive guidance on governance.
* This approach contrasted with Brahmanical traditions that were deeply intertwined with statecraft and royal authority.

# The Influence of Brahmanism on Buddhism

* Brahmins influenced Southeast Asian societies regardless of the dominant religion.
* Buddhism adapted to existing social orders shaped by Brahmanism.
* This relationship was not competitive but one of accommodation.

#  Brahmanical Influence in Buddhist Sri Lanka

* Despite being a predominantly Buddhist kingdom, Sri Lankan rulers sought advice from brahmanical Sanskrit literature like the *Arthaśāstra* and the *Laws of Manu*.
* This demonstrates the influence of Brahmanical political ideas even in a Buddhist context.

# Complex Relationship Between Brahmanism and Buddhism in South Asia

* King Harsavardhana's example illustrates the complex relationship, as he supported both Brahmanism and Buddhism.
* Similarly, King Vikramendravarman I of Āndhra supported both Buddhism and Shaivism.

# Buddhism and the Delegation of Activities to Brahmins

* Buddhism seemingly delegated certain activities to Brahmins, such as rituals marking significant life events.
* Philosopher Udayana's statement suggests that even Buddhists might have participated in Vedic rites.




## 3.2 Science And Religion In Classical India

* This chapter analyzes the attitude towards sciences in classical India by comparing Brahmanism and Buddhism.
* It draws inspiration from David S. Landes' work on the "Wealth and Poverty of Nations" which explores why Europe was different, partly due to its religious roots of technology as highlighted by David F. Noble.
* Noble argues that Western technological development stemmed from a connection with redemption established in the 9th century, contrasting with earlier disdain for mechanical arts like medicine and architecture.

* The chapter examines whether religious attitudes played a role in the development of science in India, comparing it to the European context.
* It explores the perception of medicine in Vedic literature, noting that physicians were considered impure and unfit for certain rituals.
* Several Dharmasūtras and Purānas exclude physicians from privileges and social acceptance.

* The chapter investigates the attitude towards mathematics/astrology/astronomy in classical India, citing Puranic lists of sinners that include astrologers and mathematicians.
* It suggests that this opposition might be due to astrology contradicting Brahmanical philosophy's emphasis on karma, although other explanations are possible.
* The Mānava Dharmaśāstra forbids Brahmins who have renounced possessions from practicing astrology for alms.

* The chapter contrasts the Brahmanical perspective with Buddhism's five sciences: self-knowledge, logic, words, medicine, and arts/crafts.
* It notes that Buddhism emphasizes these sciences for personal development and helping others.
* Notably absent from this list are astrology, astronomy, and mathematics, areas where Buddhists made no significant contributions unlike their involvement in logic, medicine, grammar, and philosophy.

* The Śārdūlakarṇāvadāna is mentioned as a potential exception, featuring extensive astronomical and astrological knowledge attributed to a king trying to impress a Brahmin.
* However, this example reinforces the observation that Buddhists did not actively participate in these fields, leaving them to Brahmanical and Jain thinkers.

# Why Did Buddhists Not Participate in the Development of Jyotih*śāstra*?

* Buddhists did not participate in the development of jyotish*śāstra*, which combines astronomy, astrology, and mathematics.
* This was likely because they viewed these practices as "base arts" and "wrong means of livelihood."
* Early Buddhist sermons condemned activities like predicting eclipses, reading omens, and making predictions about people's lives.

# The Influence of Buddhism on Brahmanism

* Buddhists and Brahmins had a complex relationship marked by both rivalry and influence.
* While Buddhists rejected astrology and related practices, these activities were embraced by some Brahmins.
* Buddhist disapproval may have influenced certain Brahmins to frown upon these practices as well.

# The Legacy of Buddhist Abstention

* Buddhist abstention from jyotish*śāstra* did not halt its development within Brahmanism.
* Brahmanical mathematics achieved significant advancements.
* Some normative Brahmin texts criticized astrology and related sciences, potentially influenced by Buddhist views.
* However, not all Brahmins adhered to these prohibitions, allowing the field to continue flourishing. 




## 3.3 A New Language

* Some Buddhists in northwestern India adopted Sanskrit sometime during the early centuries CE.
* This shift coincided with a period of sanskritization of other languages like Gāndhārī, likely influenced by the Kusāṇ ̣as empire.
* Before this period, Buddhists used regional languages and had no reason to adopt Sanskrit, the language of Brahmins.

* The adoption of Sanskrit remains a mystery as Buddhism had thrived without it for centuries.

*  A similar shift occurred in the political realm, with political inscriptions transitioning from Middle Indic languages to Sanskrit around the mid-2nd century CE.
* This change suggests an alignment with the brahmanical elite and their vision of society.
* The Ksatrapa king Rudradāman's inscription exemplifies this trend, using Sanskrit to express support for Brahmins and a hierarchical social order.

* Buddhists relied on royal patronage for monasteries and stūpas, necessitating interaction with the court.
* To effectively advocate for their interests, Buddhists needed to communicate in Sanskrit, the language of the court.
* They could challenge Brahmins not on political matters but on spiritual well-being, leveraging their developed philosophical system.



# Arriving in the Assemblee Hall

* The king should allow unrestricted access to those wishing to see him in connection with their affairs.
* He should look into the affairs of temple deities, hermitages, heretics, Brahmins learned in the Vedas, cattle and holy places, minors, the aged, the sick, the distressed and helpless and women.
* This order should be followed or matters should be addressed according to their importance or urgency.

# The Primary Aim Of Legal Courts

* The primary aim of these legal courts may have been to provide justice to those in need.
* More recent sources suggest that these same legal courts were the ideal platform for disagreements of a philosophical and ideological nature.
* Serious disagreements between Brahmins, Buddhists and other heretics were often linked to the proprietorship of monasteries, hermitages and temples.

# The Buddhist Adoption Of Sanskrit

* Buddhists might be called upon to defend their interests at the royal court through legal or philosophical debates in Sanskrit.
* This left them little choice but to make their textual material available in Sanskrit and express themselves competently in that language.
* Buddhists shifted wholesale to Sanskrit sometime during the second century ce.


# The Skills Which Made Brahmins Indispensable

* Brahmins provided supernatural protection and political and societal advice.
* They also had skills in astrology and related matters, including mastery of complex and precise calendrical systems.
* It seems likely that the pressure exerted on the Buddhists, which was strong enough to actually make them change language, reached them primarily through the intermediary of the royal court.

# Jainism, Mathurā And Sanskrit

* Like Buddhism, Jainism was born in Greater Magadha.
* Both Jainism and Buddhism spread over the Indian subcontinent in the centuries following their beginning.
* Buddhist thought went through important developments in Greater Gandhāra, in the north-western parts of the subcontinent.

# Sarvāstivāda Philosophy

* Sarvāstivāda philosophy began in Greater Gandhāra, presumably during the second century bce.
* It appears to have remained confined to the Northwest for some centuries, with a strong branch in Kaśmīra.
* The awareness of the main features of this philosophy already in the *Sūyagad*̣a suggests that this influence took place at a relatively early date, presumably in north-western India.

# Mathurā And Gandhāra

* Mathurā and Gandhāra became the two main centres of the Indian empire of the Kusāṇ ̣as during the first centuries of the Common Era.
* Given that there were also many Buddhists in Mathurā, there can be no doubt that the new Sarvāstivāda philosophy was known there.

# Jainism And Stūpa Worship

* Mathurā is famous for the big jaina stūpa that has been discovered there.
* There are various historical sources that mention stūpas in connection with Jainism.
* Certain texts of the Śvetāmbara canon explain why the bodily remains of tīrthaṅ*kara*s are not worshipped.

## The History of Jainism in Mathurā: A Textual Analysis

* **The Disappearance of Relic Worship:**

    * Jain relic worship may have been abandoned due to competition with Buddhism in Mathurā.

    * This abandonment is supported by the lack of stūpa worship in Jainism compared to Buddhism.
* **Āyāgapata Stones and Stūpas:**

    * Some *āyāgapata*̣s from Mathurā depict stūpas, suggesting they were part of Jain religious life at one point.

    * This supports the idea that Jainism may have abandoned relic worship later in its history.
* **Vegetarianism and Canonical Texts:**

    * The strict vegetarianism of Jain monks is difficult to reconcile with certain canonical passages mentioning meat consumption.

    * This discrepancy could be explained by a break in Jain history, possibly after the mass exodus from Mathurā.

* **The Nandīcūrnī and a Crisis in Mathurā:**

    * The *Nandīcūrn*̣i describes a famine in Mathurā that led to a loss of scriptures and traditions.
    * This event suggests a significant break in Jainism's history in Mathurā, potentially affecting all aspects of the religion.

* **The Adoption of Sanskrit:**

    * Buddhists adopted Sanskrit under the Kusāṇ ̣as due to their dependence on the royal court.

    * Jainas in Mathurā resisted adopting Sanskrit despite being influenced by Sanskrit texts.
* **Jain Patronage and Independence:**

    * Jainism in Mathurā was supported by merchants, artisans, and other members of the middle class.

    * This independence from royal patronage may explain why Jainas did not adopt Sanskrit like Buddhists.




# Jaina Monks and Royal Courts

* Jaina monks were generally wanderers who avoided close ties with kings.
* Ancient texts forbid monks from accepting alms from kings.
* Jainism during its early centuries received limited royal sponsorship, making it a "non-imperial religion."

# The Tattvārtha Sūtra and Its Origins

* The *Tattvārtha Sūtra* is likely the oldest surviving Jaina text in Sanskrit.
* It shows closer resemblance to Digambara practices than Śvetāmbara ones.
* Analysis suggests its author was a Yāpanīya, potentially composed in South India between 150-350 CE.

# The Role of Mathurā and Sanskrit in Jainism

* Mathurā played no significant role in introducing Sanskrit into Jainism.
* The *Tattvārtha Sūtra*'s use of Sanskrit suggests a connection to royal courts, unlike the Śvetāmbaras.
* Southern Jainas, particularly Digambaras, may have been more reliant on royal patronage due to their possession of caves and monasteries.

# Influences on Śvetāmbara Jainism

* Śvetāmbara Jainism was heavily influenced by Sarvāstivāda Buddhism during its formative period.
* This influence is evident in doctrines like the atomic nature of reality.
* Śvetāmbaras likely distanced themselves from Buddhism by abandoning a stūpa cult.

# Differences Between Southern and Northern Jainas

* Southern Jainas, due to their reliance on royal support, adopted Sanskrit for religious texts.
* Śvetāmbara Jainas, with their mendicant lifestyle, had less interaction with royal courts and did not feel the need to use Sanskrit.





## 3.4 Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, The Original Language

* Buddhists adopted Sanskrit for practical reasons but soon began treating it as a sacred language like Brahmanism.
* Languages of religious texts are often seen as more than ordinary languages, as exemplified by Hebrew in Christianity and Judaism, Arabic in Islam, and Sanskrit in Hinduism.
* In India, Sanskrit was considered the only correct language, with other languages being incorrect.

* Patañjali's *Mahābhāsya* distinguishes between correct and incorrect words, arguing that using correct words produces virtue and benefit.
* He also believes Sanskrit is universal and eternal, citing examples of its use in different regions and worlds.
* Later authors like Bhartṛhari and Kumārila Bhatṭa further emphasize the divine nature and eternality of Sanskrit.

* Theravāda Buddhists considered Pāli (Māgadhī) as the original language of all beings, claiming it was natural and unchanging.
* Jainas believed Ardha-Māgadhī was the original language, even surpassing Sanskrit in its purity and universality.
* Namisādhu, a later Jaina author writing in Sanskrit, argued that Ardha-Māgadhī predated Sanskrit and served as its basis.

* Both Theravāda Buddhists and Jainas claimed their respective sacred languages were the origin of all languages, including Sanskrit.
* This presented a challenge for Jainas who shifted to using Sanskrit, potentially contradicting their own beliefs.

* Vedic Brahmins faced a similar problem with the differences between Vedic and classical Sanskrit.
* They addressed this by denying any discrepancy, arguing that Vedic was simply an older form of Sanskrit requiring specialized knowledge.




# The Continuity between Vedic and Classical Sanskrit

* Brahmanism emphasized the continuity or essential identity between Vedic and classical Sanskrit.
* Both were considered original and eternal, constituting one and the same language.
* This allowed for deriving Vedic primary nouns from classical verbal roots and vice versa.

# Buddhist Views on Hybrid Sanskrit

* Some Buddhists treated Hybrid Sanskrit as essentially identical to classical Sanskrit, similar to the Brahmanical view of Vedic and classical Sanskrit.
* Kumāralāta's grammar used the term *ārsa* (belonging to the ṛsị-s) for peculiar forms in Buddhist scriptures, suggesting a parallel with how Brahmins treated Vedic.

# Jain Views on Ardha-Māgadhī

* Jainas also used the term *ārsa* to refer to their sacred language, Ardha-Māgadhī.
* Unlike Buddhists, they considered Ardha-Māgadhī as the source of Sanskrit.

# Candrakīrti's Use of Vedic Rules

* Candrakīrti, a Buddhist commentator, explained Hybrid Sanskrit forms using Vedic rules from Pāṇini's *Astādhyāyī*.
* This suggests that at least some Buddhists considered Hybrid Sanskrit and classical Sanskrit to be essentially the same language.

# Bhartṛhari's *Vākyapadīya*

* A verse in Bhartṛhari's *Vākyapadīya* mentions "upholders of impermanence" who believed that the source language was Prakrit, from which Sanskrit derived.
* This view might refer to Jainas rather than Buddhists due to similarities with Namisādhu's defense of Prakrit and the use of the term *prākṛta*.

# Conclusion

* Different religious groups in classical India believed their sacred texts were composed in the earliest language, the source of all others.
* Theravāda Buddhism and Jainism saw their sacred languages (Māgadhī/Pāli and Ardha-Māgadhī) as the source of Sanskrit.
* Vedic Brahmins considered Vedic and classical Sanskrit as one single, eternal language.
* Some Buddhists likely held a similar view to Brahmins, while others might have believed Hybrid Sanskrit was the source of Sanskrit.

## 3.5 Buddhism Sanskritized, Buddhism Brahmanized

* The adoption of Sanskrit by Buddhists was accompanied by the acceptance of certain brahmanical ideas and customs.
* While Buddhists did not necessarily agree with all aspects of brahmanical thought, they adopted a watered-down version of it as normative.
* Buddhist texts began to depict people, including Buddhists themselves, living in a brahmanical world.

## Aśvaghosa's Works

* Aśvaghosa's *Buddhacarita* and *Saundarananda* depict the Buddha's father, Śuddhodana, as an ideal brahmanical king who performs sacrifices, follows Vedic rituals, and has a Purohita.
* This contrasts with other contemporary biographies of the Buddha, such as the *Mahāvastu* and the *Lalitavistara*, which either ignore or downplay Śuddhodana's kingly virtues.

## The Role of Brahmins

* Aśvaghosa's familiarity with brahmanical learning suggests he may have been born a Brahmin.
* Brahmin converts to Buddhism like Aśvaghosa likely played a prominent role in literary production during the shift from Middle Indic to Sanskrit.
* This prominence may have contributed to the brahmanization of Buddhism, either consciously or unconsciously.

## Other Examples

* Kumāralāta's *Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā* also depicts the Buddha in a brahmanical context, with characters referencing Vaiśesika philosophy and the Buddha's knowledge of the Veda and sacrifices.
* Āryaśūra's *Jātakamālā*, while critical of certain aspects of brahmanical statecraft (*nīti*), still portrays the Buddha within a world influenced by Brahmanism.





# Brahmanical Influence on Buddhism

* The ideal king in the *Jātakamālā* behaves according to brahmanical principles, even though the text criticizes these principles.
* This king upholds the three brahmanical aims of life (*trivarga*) and relies on Brahmin advisors.
*  The author suggests that this reflects a belief that Brahmanism was older than Buddhism and that Indian society had been entirely brahmanical before the Buddha's time.

# The Absence of Brahmanical Influence in Pali Jātakas

* Unlike Sanskrit Jātakas, Pali Jātakas do not prominently feature brahmanical ideology.
* Brahmins are present but their ideas about kingship and society are not presented as normative.
* The *Gaṇḍ*atindu Jātaka* exemplifies this lack of dominant brahmanical influence.

# Brahmanical Influence in Other Buddhist Texts

* Sanskrit versions of Jātakas often depict characters with higher social standing than their Pali counterparts, suggesting a preference for brahmanical norms.
* The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang observed that Buddhists in India adhered to the caste system.
* Mātṛceta's *Varṇārhavarṇ*astotra* incorporates brahmanical concepts and even identifies the Buddha with the god Brahmā.

# Brahmanical Framing of Discourse

* The author compares the situation to a political debate in the United States where one side successfully framed the discussion in terms favorable to its worldview.
* Similarly, Brahmins controlled the language used to discuss society in ancient India, making it difficult for others to express alternative viewpoints without adopting their terminology.

# The Adoption of "Yoga" by Buddhists

* Early Buddhist texts do not use "yoga" in a religious sense.
* Later Buddhist texts demonstrate awareness of Yoga practitioners and eventually begin referring to themselves as practitioners of Yoga.

# Yoga and Sāṃkhya

* The *Mahābhārata* distinguishes between two paths to liberation: Yoga (effort) and Sāṃkhya (knowledge).
* In brahmanical texts, *yoga* refers to ascetic practices emphasizing bodily control, similar to early Jainism.

# Buddhism and Yoga

* The *Mahābhārata*'s *Śāntiparvan* contains a reference to Buddhist meditation (*dhyānayoga*), suggesting an early association of Yoga with Buddhism.
* Aśvaghosa's *Buddhacarita* also uses *dhyānayoga* to describe the Bodhisattva's path.

# Buddhists as Yogis

* Post-canonical Buddhists adopted terms like *yogācāra* and *yogāvacara* to refer to themselves or their practices.
* This borrowing suggests that Brahmanical influence on Buddhism extended beyond those who adopted Sanskrit.

# Brahmanism's Influence on Buddhism

* There was a tendency among Buddhists to view Buddhism as secondary to Brahmanism, arising from it and deriving its ideas from it.
* This perception may have weakened Buddhism from within.

# Jainism and Brahmanism

* Jainism faced more severe persecution than Buddhism and had to adopt brahmanical practices and beliefs to survive.
* Newar Buddhism in Nepal is an example of Buddhism adapting to Brahmanical structures and values.

# Brahmanical Victory

* Brahmanism ultimately triumphed over Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent, either leading to its disappearance or its assimilation into Brahmanical forms.
* Buddhism came to see itself as a deviation from Brahmanism, which was perceived as the default condition of Indian religion and society.

## 3.6 Philosophical Encounters

* Buddhists were skilled debaters and used this skill to demonstrate their intellectual superiority over Brahmins.
* This led Brahmins to develop coherent philosophies like Vaiśesika and Sām ̣ ̣khya.
* A story illustrates how a Brahmin, Kauśika, became convinced of the truth of Buddhist doctrine after reading a text on dependent origination.

##  Buddhist vs. Brahmanical Philosophy

* Buddhists believed the common-sense world was not ultimately real, while Brahmins believed it was. 
* This difference may be linked to their roles: Brahmins advised kings on practical matters and couldn't deny reality, while Buddhists aimed to draw attention to spiritual realities.

## Conversion and Social Roles

*  Brahmins could convert to Buddhism but not vice versa.
* Examples suggest that Brahmins who converted to Buddhism could retain their social position.
* Jainism also had Brahmins, suggesting a compatibility between religious choice and social status.


## Philosophical Debates at Royal Courts

* Evidence suggests that philosophical debates often took place at royal courts.
* An inscription commemorates a Jain preceptor and mentions several earlier Digambaras who engaged in public debates at royal courts.

# Debates at the Royal Court

* Debaters hoped to impress not only their rivals but also the king.
* Kings could provide protection, favors, honors, and support in the form of gifts of money or land.
* The ultimate goal for a debater was often to convert the king to their cause.

# Rewards for Skillful Debaters

* While debates are rarely mentioned in inscriptions, some evidence suggests that kings rewarded skillful debaters.
* A Brahmin named Gaṅgādhara received a village from a king due to his debating skills.
* Other skills, such as astronomy and poetry, were also valued by kings.
* The inscription from Dharwar shows that Jainas faced unfair competition when challenged by a devotee of Śiva.

# The Entertainment Value of Debates

* Philosophical debates might not have been as entertaining for kings as other forms of competition.
* Kings may have preferred something more exciting than unintelligible discussions about philosophical topics.

# Debaters and Material Gain

* Some debaters profited materially from their skills.
* A Buddhist Śīlabhadra received the revenue of an entire city after defeating a Brahmin in debate.
* The Sāṃkhya philosopher Vindhyavāsa received three lacs of gold after defeating a Buddhist priest.

# The Perspective of the Losing Side

* Information about debates usually comes from the winning side.
* Occasionally, we find accounts from the losing side acknowledging the superior debating skills of their opponents.
* Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅgiṇī admits the Buddhists' skill in debate and highlights the Brahmins' other strengths.

# The Role of Courts in Indian Debates

* Kings were more interested in the powers of Brahmins than the debating skills of Buddhists.
* Debates between representatives of different philosophical schools were not primarily organized to entertain kings.
* Solomon suggests a connection between legal courts and intellectual disputes, citing similarities in procedure and terminology. 
* A drum was used to summon people to court or challenge a dispute.

# The Importance of Winning Debates

* Incorrect philosophical opinions were rejected by the court.
* Vindhyavāsa, a Sāṃkhya teacher, challenged Buddhists to a debate with his life at stake.
* The king allowed the debate and summoned Buddhist teachers to participate.
* Buddhamitra, an elderly Buddhist teacher, accepted the challenge.

# Debate Strategies and Tactics

* Debates were serious affairs with high stakes.
* Debaters had to carefully consider their opponents' strengths and weaknesses, as well as the jury's knowledge and attitude.
* The Caraka-saṃ*hitā* offers advice on choosing opponents and juries for debates.
* Brahmins might use magical means to influence the outcome of a debate.

# Distrust of Reasoning

* Some brahmanical authors expressed distrust in reasoning.
* The *Laws of Manu* condemned those who relied on logic to disparage scripture and tradition.
* Bhartṛhari, a philosopher himself, believed that logic should not contradict the Vedas.
* Apocalyptic accounts depicted Buddhism as a threat, possibly due to its reliance on reasoning.



# Question: One should not engage in debate. Why?

* All those who engage in debate promote hatred, arrogance and pride.
* Their thoughts are confused and their minds are rarely gentle or peaceful.
* They point out what is bad in others and proclaim what is good in themselves.

# Answer: This is not so.

* The author did not undertake this treatise for the sake of victory or to increase profit or fame.
* Rather, they wish to reveal all features (good and bad) in debate.

# If the world had no debate

* The confused would be many.
* The author wishes to spread the true teaching of the Buddha all over the world.

# Just as, in order to cultivate the fruits of mango trees

* One plants widely around them thickets of brambles so as to protect their fruits.
* In writing this treatise, the author acts in the same way.
* They wish to protect the true teaching of the Buddha (*dharma*) and do not seek fame.

# It is possible that the pious feelings expressed by the author are no more than rhetoric

* But even if it is mere rhetoric, it must be noted that this rhetoric is different from the one we came across in the brahmanical texts.
* At the brahmanical side we seem to find more distrust, even cynicism, with regard to logic, than at the buddhist side.

# A fuller investigation would be required to find out whether this observation has general validity.

* We have seen that the Buddhists from the northwest entered the scene with an well thought out ontology.
* It is capable of explaining the constitution of the world, and the role of language in it.
* One aspect of their ontology entailed that the objects of our ordinary experience are not real: we assume their existence on the basis of the words of language.

# Other aspects included the atomic nature of reality

* Both on a material and on a temporal level.
* An exhaustive enumeration of all there is.

# Of the two brahmanical ontologies mentioned above—Vaiśesika and 
Sāṃkhya

* The first one is of particular interest in the present context because it betrays in its most fundamental structure the influence of buddhist thought.

# This is not surprising if the historical picture here presented is correct.

* The newly developed buddhist ontology constituted a challenge to the Brahmins.
* Since initially they had nothing equivalent, the buddhist challenge set the tune.

# Brahmins called upon to respond had to think out a coherent ontology of their own which could face this challenge on all major points.

* They did so, and the result is known as Vaiśesika.

# Vaiśesika ontology disagrees in many respects with buddhist 
ontology

* But is yet clearly structured around issues which the northwestern Buddhists had raised.

# Consider the following:

* The Buddhists claimed to have an exhaustive enumeration of all there is.
* Vaiśesika created one, too.
* The Buddhists insisted on the atomistic nature of reality.
* Vaiśesika did so, too.
* The Buddhists maintained that composite objects do not exist.
* Vaiśesika took the opposite position, claiming that composite objects are as real as their constituents.

# The Buddhists held that ordinary reality (which is not "real") corresponds to the words of language.

* Vaiśesika adopted the same claim with this difference that it maintained that all that exists corresponds to the words of language, and is real in the highest sense.
* It will hardly be necessary to point out that Vaiśesika ontology, in order to incorporate these positions, had to consider numerous detailed questions and issues, just as buddhist ontology had done earlier.

# The resulting doctrinal edifice is as impressive as the one erected by the Buddhists.

* One can easily imagine debates in which Buddhist and Brahmin protagonists would have ample opportunity to prove their philosophical sophistication and acuity, not to speak of their skills in debate.
* Note however that the Vaiśesika belief in the reality of the objects of our ordinary experience is part of the fundamental axioms of this ontology, just as the buddhist disbelief in their reality is part of its ontology.

# This is not the occasion for a discussion of Sāṃkhya ontology.

* Let it be enough to point out that this ontology, too, never questions the reliability of our ordinary experience.
* As said earlier, the Brahmins were not ready to doubt the reality of the objects of normal experience.

# The Buddhists were, and the ontology they created in the northwest was but a first notification of more to come.


* Once Brahmins had created ontologies on a par with the ontology designed by the Buddhists, the intellectual competition for precedence between the two groups arrived at a stalemate.
* The latter maintained that the world of our experience is real, the former that it isn't.

# Neither group could *prove* that they were right.

* All they could do was show that their respective positions in this matter fitted into sophisticated ontologies.

# But which of these two ontologies was correct?
* Or rather, independently of questions of ontology, is there a way to show that the world of our experience is or is not real?

# Both Buddhists and Brahmins needed a breakthrough that would show that their opponents were wrong.

* This breakthrough came from the side of the Buddhists, who succeeded in *proving* that the world of our experience cannot be real.
* It cannot be real, because the world of our experience is self-contradictory.

# We do not know for sure who discovered the proof of the self-contradictory nature of the world of our experience.

* The person who used it to launch an all-out attack against those who thought otherwise is Nāgārjuna.
* I will give an illustration of his way of arguing below.


# Here it must be emphasized that his opponents, including most notably his brahmanical opponents, took notice.

* Nāgārjuna's attacks forced them to rethink their positions, and to reformulate their philosophies in manners that made them immune to these attacks.
* This led to major changes in the philosophies concerned.

# Nāgārjuna's brahmanical opponents had to defend themselves, for they were committed to the view that the world of our experience is real.

# One example must suffice to show how Nāgārjuna proved the unreality, or rather the impossibility, of the phenomenal world.

* In order to understand his argument, we must recall that both buddhist and brahmanical thinkers agreed that the objects of the phenomenal world correspond to the words of language.
* Nāgārjuna extended this idea slightly, so that it came to mean that the words of a sentence correspond to the things described by that sentence; this is what I call his *correspondence principle*.

# No one in Nāgārjuna's time and after it objected, which allows us to conclude that both Buddhists and Brahmins considered the idea in this expanded form unexceptionable.

* It covers statements such as "Mary reads a book".
* Everyone agrees that this statement describes a situation in which Mary, her book, and the act of reading have their place.

# But Nāgārjuna applies the same idea to statements such as "Mary makes a pot".

* The situation described by this statement does not contain a pot, and is therefore in conflict with the correspondence principle.
* Nāgārjuna does not conclude from this that there is something wrong with this principle.

# No, he concludes from it that it is impossible to make a pot.

* He expresses this, for example, in the following verse: "If any unproduced entity is found anywhere it could be produced.
* Since that entity does not exist, what is produced?"

# I am not going to discuss Nāgārjuna's arguments in further detail.

* In the present context it is especially interesting to note that his brahmanical opponents had to invent a number of tricks to "save" phenomenal reality.
* According to them, Mary can make a pot.

# At the same time they did not see what was wrong with the correspondence principle.

* The various ways in which they struggled to accept bothphenomenal reality and the correspondence principle—have been studied elsewhere.


# This brief sketch provides the necessary background for a discussion of an observation made by Vincent Eltschinger in a recent paper (forthcoming a).

* Eltschinger points out that there are nearly no textually or otherwise documentable hints at *philosophical* confrontation between Buddhists and Brahmins before the end of the 5th century ce.
* What is more, "with few exceptions (Āryadeva's Catuḥ*śataka*, the pseudo-Nāgārjuna's *Vaidalyaprakaran*̣a, discussions scattered throughout Vasubandhu's *Abhidharmakośa Bhāsya*̣ ), the Buddhists start systematically criticising brahmanical (and sporadically jaina) philosophies during the first half of the 6th century, or slightly earlier in the case of Dignāga (Dignāga, Dharmapāla, Dharmakīrti, Bhāviveka, Guṇamati, *Sagāthaka* of the [Laṅ*kāvatāra Sūtra*], etc.).

# The same seems to hold true of the brahmanical philosophers' critique of buddhist doctrines (Nyāyavārttika, Vṛ*ttikāragrantha*288 and especially 
[Ślokavārttika], *Yuktidīpikā*).

* Or, to put it otherwise, philosophical confrontation between Buddhists and Brahmins starts being reflected in extant philosophical literature from the beginning of the 6th century onwards."

# Should we conclude from this that no debates between Buddhists and Brahmins took place before that date?

* Eltschinger does not make this claim, yet points out that there is no conclusive evidence to prove the opposite.
* What is more, he argues that the period which sees the beginning of philosophical confrontation between Buddhists and Brahmins reflected in extant literature, roughly the end of the Gupta empire, is also the period in which brahmanical apocalyptic eschatology begins to see in the Buddhists a major threat to the wellbeing of the world; this had not been the case so far.

# Eltschinger's arguments leave little doubt that the opposition between Buddhists and Brahmins became much more intense from, say, the beginning of the 6th century onward.

* However, our brief sketch of some crucial philosophical developments before this period, given above, shows that there had been interaction between buddhist and brahmanical philosophers from the very beginning.
* Somehow buddhist and brahmanical thinkers knew each other's ideas well enough to be profoundly influenced by them, and to take on shared problems more or less simultaneously.

# It can hardly be doubted that these earlier buddhist and brahmanical philosophers, too, were in competition with each other, even if this competition may not have reached the intensity and thirst for blood which it attained in the second half of the first millennium.

* There is therefore no need to abandon the hypothesis that buddhist and brahmanical thinkers confronted each other in debate, at least from time to time.
* If we combine this hypothesis with our earlier observation that systematic philosophy in India arose in surroundings where public debates may have been common—i.e., in the hellenized northwestern parts of the subcontinent—it seems safe to maintain that a certain amount of public debate did not only contribute to the beginnings of systematic philosophy in India, but continued to play a role and was responsible for its survival over the centuries as well.

# Eltschinger is certainly correct in drawing attention to the important changes that took place in the middle of the first millennium.


* One further way—apart from the intensified confrontation between Buddhists and Brahmins—in which it finds expression is the new form of brahmanical philosophy that joins the public debate roughly from that date onward.
* This is the Vedānta philosophy, thus called because it claims to be based on the texts called Upanisads, which constitute the ̣

## 3.7 The Relics Of The Buddha Relic Worship

* Brahmanism spread its ideas to other layers of society through stories highlighting the power and excellence of Brahmins.
* Brahmanical values found their way into the lives of people belonging to other layers of society.
* Brahmanical ideas of purity were hard to reconcile with certain Buddhist practices, particularly the worship of bodily remains of the Buddha and other saints.

##  Relic Worship in Greater Magadha

* Evidence suggests that the worship of bodily relics was part of the culture of Greater Magadha.
* The *Śatapatha Brāhman*̣a mentions round sepulchral mounds used by "demonic people from the east," which are contrasted with the four-cornered mounds used by followers of the *Śatapatha Brāhman*̣a.
* Scholars believe these round mounds were predecessors to Buddhist stūpas.

##  Buddhist and Jain Stūpas

* Both Buddhism and Jainism had stūpas, which contained the remains of prominent persons.
* Literary references and archaeological evidence confirm this practice.
* A passage in the *Mahābhārata* associates stūpa-like constructions with godlessness and social disorder.


## Brahmanical Views on Death

* Brahmanism looked down upon anything to do with dead bodies, considering them impure.
* The clash between Brahmanism and religions from the east (primarily Buddhism) was partly a clash between two different ways of dealing with dead bodies.

## Buddhist Relic Worship and Purity

* Gregory Schopen studied passages from the *Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya* which show the concern of its authors for ritual purity.
* He points out that Buddhist monks shared brahmanical aversion to corpses, leading them to frame rules to conform to brahmanical notions of purity.


## The Shift in Relic Veneration

* Alfred Foucher observed a shift in veneration from relics to stūpas over time.
* André Bareau notes that the stūpa participates in the sacred character of the relics and the Buddha, becoming personified.
* Monasteries were built next to stūpas, indicating monks' interest in them.

## Justifying Stūpa Veneration

* The Buddhist tradition provided elements for justifying veneration of objects related to but different from bodily relics.
* The Buddha emphasized the importance of his teaching over his person.
* The term *dhammakāya* ("he whose body is the dharma") qualifies the Buddha, suggesting that his real body is his teaching.



# The Teaching of the Buddha

* The teaching of the Buddha is preserved in canonical texts, which are venerated.
* Some passages emphasize the superiority of these texts over physical relics.
* Archaeological evidence shows stūpas containing canonical texts instead of or alongside relics.
* Manuscripts were sometimes called "relics in the form of the teaching".

# The Stūpa as Representation

* Some Buddhists considered the stūpa itself a representation of the Buddha's teaching.
* They believed each of the thirty-seven "dharmas helpful to enlightenment" corresponded to an identifiable part of the stūpa.

# The 84,000 Dharmas

* The teaching of the Buddha is sometimes divided into 84,000 *dharmaskandha*s.
* This division is less common than the previous one.
* The number 84,000 also refers to relics collected by Emperor Aśoka, each placed in a separate stūpa.

# Dharmakāya

*  The term *dharmakāya* originally meant "he whose body is the teaching".
* It later came to refer to the teaching itself as the Buddha's body.
* Some interpretations suggest that the *dharmakāya* is more real than the physical body of the Buddha.

# Relics and the Physical Body

* Certain Buddhist thinkers argue that the physical body of a Buddha cannot be his essential body.
* They cite examples like the Bodhisattva learning writing and seeking instruction from heretical masters despite knowing Buddhist doctrine.

# The Rise of Images

* From around the 2nd century CE, stūpas faced competition from Buddha images.
* Initially, these images likely represented the Buddha's physical body.
* This allowed for veneration without being associated with relics.

# Reinterpreting Relic Worship

* There was a tendency to reinterpret or modify relic worship so that relics played a reduced role.
* Stūpas replaced bones; bones were replaced by texts considered the real body of the Buddha.

# Brahmanical Influence

* This shift away from physical remains may have been influenced by brahmanical ideas about purity.

# Relics in Non-Brahmanical Regions

* In regions where Buddhism did not encounter Brahmanism, relics were not hidden or replaced.
* Examples include the tooth relic of the Buddha in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and public displays of relics in China.




# The Absence of Brahmanism in Gandhāra

*  Brahmanism was virtually absent from the extreme northwest of the Indian subcontinent.
* This region had a strong Buddhist presence.
* The lack of Brahmanism helps explain the accessibility and prevalence of Buddhist relics in this area.

# What Happened To The Body Of The Buddha?

* Hendrik Kern, a 19th-century scholar, controversially argued that the Buddha had no physical body and was a sun myth.
* This view has been largely rejected by modern scholarship.
* Most scholars agree that the Buddha existed, had a physical body that was cremated after his death, and that his remains were placed in stūpas.

# Relic Worship and Stūpas

* The cult of relics is central to most forms of Buddhism.
* Stūpas, often containing relics of the Buddha, have spread wherever Buddhism has gone.
* The distribution of the Buddha's relics after his cremation is a crucial aspect of Buddhist tradition.

# Parallels with Hindu and Jain Traditions

* Relic and stūpa worship predates Buddhism and can be found in Jainism and possibly Ājīvikism.
* A similar tradition exists in Hinduism, where the bodies of certain renouncers are buried instead of cremated.
* These burial sites, called *samādhi*, are often associated with yogic absorption and become pilgrimage centers.

## Parry (1994: 260) Writes The Following About Aghori Ascetics:

*  Aghori ascetics, through their *sadhana*, achieve a state of perpetual cataleptic condition known as *samadhi*.
* Their bodies are arranged in a meditative posture (*padmasan*) and placed in a box buried in the grounds of an *ashram*.
* Unlike other ascetics, their skulls are not smashed. A phallic emblem of Shiva is erected over the grave, transmitting power from the ascetic's meditation.

## By entering *samadhi*:

* The ascetic escapes death's consequences: severance of soul and body, corruption, and transmigration.
* If achieved while alive (*jivit-samadhi*), their body remains undecayed for thousands of years.
* While *samādhi*s appear in records from the 12th century ce onwards, they likely continue an earlier tradition of renouncer burials without tombs.

##  Abbé Dubois' Account of Sannyasi Funerals:

* Sannyasis are buried, unlike Vanaprasthas who are cremated.
* The deceased is wrapped in yellow cloths, rubbed with ashes, and adorned with *rudrakshas*.
* The body is placed in a bamboo basket and buried near a river or tank in a salt-filled grave.
* The head is left exposed, and coconuts are broken on it until the skull is fractured.
* A lingam is erected over the grave, and offerings are made to it.

##  Origins of Burial Customs:

* This custom is mentioned in para-vedic texts, indicating its antiquity.
* It was not associated with impurity, suggesting a pre-brahmanical origin.
* The author suggests these customs originated in Greater Magadha, where there was no fear of dead bodies or ritual purity obsession.
* This hypothesis is supported by the similarity of burial practices among Buddhists, Jainas, and some Hindu renouncers.

##  Funerary Customs in Vedic Literature:

* The *Chāndogya Upanisad* mentions followers of demons adorning corpses with offerings.
* This practice resembles the treatment of the Buddha's body before cremation.
* The author suggests these practices may have been common among those considered "demonic" by brahmanical texts.

##  Preserving Corpses in Ancient India:

* Texts mention immersing bodies in oil-filled tubs (*tailadron*̣ī) for preservation.
* The *Rāmāyaṇa* and *Visṇ ̣u Purāṇa* describe this practice for specific cases.
* The Pāli Aṅ*guttara Nikāya* recounts a king's desire to preserve his wife's body using this method.

##  The Buddha's Funeral:

* The Buddha instructed his body be treated like a world-ruler's, wrapped in cloths and placed in an oil-filled iron tub (*teladon*̣ī).
* This suggests the practice of immersion in oil for preservation may have been known and accepted in Buddhist circles as well.

## The Preservation of the Buddha's Body

* Ernst Waldschmidt suggested that the Buddha's body was preserved in oil to allow time for cremation, but this is contradicted by the text which states the body was placed in the tub after seven days.
* André Bareau initially agreed with Waldschmidt but later proposed that the oil bath was a rare practice reserved for high-ranking individuals, misunderstanding the source material he relied on.

##  The Problem of Incompatible Elements

* The traditional accounts of the Buddha's funeral contain incompatible elements, suggesting they may have been modified over time.
* It is possible an earlier account described the entombment of the Buddha without cremation, with the body preserved in oil while a stūpa was built.

##  The Shift to Cremation

* The hypothesis suggests that cremation was later introduced, but the episode with the oil bath remained, becoming an anomaly.
* This change may have been motivated by the desire to create multiple stūpas containing relics, as opposed to a single stūpa with an uncremated body.


##  Evidence for the Original Account

* The passage in which the Buddha instructs Ānanda on his funeral arrangements mentions only one stūpa, supporting the idea of an initial account without cremation.
* A recently discovered Gāndhārī text describes King Mahāsudarśana's body being immersed in oil twice, suggesting a practice of preservation before cremation.

##  The Case of Mahākāśyapa

* The story of Mahākāśyapa entering a state of yogic concentration and remaining preserved within a mountain until the arrival of Maitreya Buddha provides another example of a body being preserved without cremation.


# What is not clear in this tradition is just when Mahākāśyapa is thought to attain parinirvāṇa.

* Some texts suggest Mahākāśyapa attains parinirvāṇa before the mountain closes in on him, his body remaining preserved until Maitreya's arrival.
* Other texts indicate that Mahākāśyapa remains alive inside the mountain in a meditative state until Maitreya arrives.

# I am not at all sure what can be concluded from this story.

* The parallelism with the entombment of Hindu saints seems evident.
* It is unclear whether the story preserves an ancient Buddhist memory or reflects external influence on Buddhism.
* The stories about Mahākāśyapa and Kāśyapa do not conflict with the hypothesis that the Buddha was not cremated.

# In this context it is also interesting to mention a passage from a Vinaya text preserved in Chinese translation (TI 1463).

* A rule stipulates clothes should not be taken from a corpse placed in a stūpa.
* This proves that inhumation was current in ancient India and non-incinerated corpses were put in stūpas or stūpa-like structures.

# I cannot leave this topic without referring to a recent article by Peter Skilling (2005).

* He draws attention to two types of relics: fragmentary and solid *ekaghana* relics.
* He questions the function of solid relics and whether they might be a trace of an earlier belief in non-fragmented remains.

# Having said this, it is yet important to point out that the story of the cremation of the Buddha's body plays a crucial role in justifying the cult of relics.

* It is understandable that pious Buddhists invented this story if it wasn't part of the oldest tradition.
* The earliest account may not reflect what really happened.

# Let us at this point recall what exactly we are discussing.

* We are discussing the earliest accessible account of what happened to the Buddha's body after death.
* This account may be the outcome of much editorial activity and its historical reliability is not guaranteed.
* What really happened to the Buddha's body after his death is likely to remain unknown.




## Buddhism Confronted With Brahmanism

* Jainism has stūpas, but their role is mysterious. 
* It's unclear if they contained relics of Mahāvīra or other saints.
* Some texts suggest the remains of Jinas were taken to heaven by gods.
* Early Jain literature mentions stūpas, and archaeology has revealed an ancient one in Mathurā.

## What Happened To Mahāvīra'S Body?

* The *Jambuddīvapannatti* describes the cremation of a tīrthaṅ*kara*, but later texts mention bone relics being taken to heaven by gods.
* This suggests that the original account may have been modified to explain the absence of relic worship in Jainism.
* The story of the Buddha's body being divided into relics and distributed likely served a similar purpose for Buddhism, justifying widespread stūpa worship.

##  The Role of Stūpas in Jainism

* Recent research has revealed that relic stūpas are not unique to aniconic Jain traditions but also exist in Mūrtipūjaka and Digambara traditions.
* The *Jambuddīvapannatti* describes the cremation of a tīrthaṅ*kara* and the construction of stūpas for them, their gaṇ*adhara*s, and other houseless monks.
* However, later episodes describe the gods taking the bodily relics of the Jina to heaven.

## Possible Scenarios

* The original account may have described the Jina's body being placed in a stūpa without cremation.
* Jainism may have adopted the practice of cremating ascetics and preserving relics later than Buddhism.
* It is possible that the Jina's body was abandoned in nature, as was the custom for other Jain ascetics in early tradition.



# 3.8 Adjustment To Political Reality

* Buddhism faced unequal competition from Brahmanism in India.
* Buddhists lacked influence in political power compared to Brahmins.
* Buddhism struggled to present a vision of society that included kings and realistic policies.
* The focus on monastic life and lay followers excluded many occupations, particularly those involved in governance.

#  

* Jatakas are stories about the Buddha's past lives.
* Buddhists believed in multiple Buddhas throughout history.
* The goal of becoming a Buddha (Bodhisattva) became popular.
* Bodhisattvas imitated the deeds recounted in the Jatakas.

* This allowed serious Buddhists to remain in society and contribute, mirroring the Buddha's own experiences.
* The text *The Inquiry of Ugra* provides advice to householder Bodhisattvas on ethical conduct and societal engagement.

## Furthermore:405

* The householder Bodhisattva should be free from attachment and aversion, attaining equanimity with respect to worldly things.
* Success or failure in obtaining wealth, wife, children, valuables, or produce should not lead to pride, joy, downcastness, or distress.
* This development emphasizes Buddhism's shift towards accepting participation in economic and social life for lay Buddhists.

## Non-Monastic Buddhists

*  Buddhism initially presented a path leading to the end of suffering through renunciation of the world.
*  Non-monastics found their place by focusing on accumulating merit, crucial for achieving rebirth as a Universal Monarch or even Buddhahood.
* The Jataka stories provided examples of ideal behavior for accumulating merit, demonstrating that one could be a committed Buddhist while living in society.

## Bodhisattvas and Killing

* The question arose whether a Bodhisattva could kill, leading to discussions about the state of mind of both the killer and victim.
* Texts like the *Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* justified killing certain individuals who opposed Buddhism, arguing it was less harmful than killing animals.

## Buddhists as Political Counselors

* Once Buddhism accepted society as legitimate, Buddhists could aspire to be political counselors, competing with Brahmins.
* Examples include the *Bodhisattvabhūmi* which emphasizes a king's duty to impose virtuous behavior on subjects, even by force.
* The VatSithor inscription from Ankor portrays both the king and his minister as Bodhisattvas guiding their subjects towards liberation.

## Magical Protection

* Brahmins held an advantage by offering magical protection through Vedic lore.
* Buddhists initially lacked this aspect, leading to a growing tendency to incorporate rites and spells into Buddhism.
* The *Suvarṇabhāsottama Sūtra* promises state protection from the Four Great Kings for kings who support monks and hold Buddhist scriptures.



# Strictly speaking this Sūtra does not offer the protection of mantras.

* Philosophically inclined Buddhists held various views about the nature and value of mantras.
* There was an upsurge of rites and spells from the seventh century ce onward.
* This is customary to speak in this connection of tantric Buddhism.

# Evidence for this is provided by certain ancillary tracts included in the Atharvavedapariśisṭ ạ .

* Tantric Buddhism borrowed extensively from non-buddhist religious currents, most notably Śaivism.
* One factor contributing to the success of Śaivism was its accommodation of brahmanical religion.

# Another factor, the most vital one according to Sanderson, "is that the religion succeeded in forging close links with the institution of kingship and thereby with the principal source of patronage." 

* Śaiva officiants occupied the office of Royal Preceptor (*rājaguru*) and gave Śaiva initiation (*dīksā*̣ ) to the monarch.
* They provided a repertoire of protective, therapeutic and aggressive rites for the benefit of the monarch and his kingdom.

# The Śaivas were not however the only ones to attempt to forge links with royalty in this manner. Buddhists tried to do so, too.

*  The *Rgya gar chos 'byun*, the Tibetan history of Indian Buddhism reports that Pāla king Dharmapāla had a fire-sacrifice performed regularly for many years by Tantric officiants.
* An inscription of the reign of Jayavarman V reveals a similar arrangement in the Khmer court of Angkor.

# There is not much direct evidence from South and Southeast Asia to show that the new emphasis on incantations and rites had as one of its aims to secure a place for Buddhists at the royal court, apart from the cases just considered.

* Mention can here be made of the description of a war machine in an Indian buddhist tantric text, the *Kālacakra Tantra*.
* This unexpected description may find a partial explanation in the fact that this text foresees a final and definitive battle between Buddhism and Islam.

# Tantric Buddhism, too, came to have its powerful ascetics, often called *siddha*s "accomplished ones".

* One story from Abhayadatta's Caturaśītisiddhapravṛ*tti* may be presented by way of illustration: In the city of Kansati, Virūpa bought wine from a tavern girl; she gave him a glass of wine and a plate of rice which he greatly enjoyed.
* He continued eating and drinking. For the space of two days and a night, he prevented the sun from moving and the king, amazed, exclaimed: "Who is it who performs such a miracle?"

# If the evidence from South Asia concerning the political role that buddhist rites and spells were meant to play is limited, it is known that Buddhism owed much of its attraction in China, Japan and elsewhere to its supposed capacity to defend the state against danger.

* It may be true that Indian esoteric Buddhism did not arise for the express purpose of converting the courts and appealing to the intelligentsia of Tibet, China, Japan, Burma, or elsewhere, it is equally true that its success was dramatic in these areas.
* The tantric master Amoghavajra, helped to defeat the invasion of China in 742 ce by a combined force of Tibetans, Arabs, Sogdians and others.

# Buddhist monks in China were exempted from military service, but were expected to execute tantric buddhist rites that would provide protection against natural and other disasters, most in particular war and enemies.

* In Japan, in 940 ce, the state was threatened by a rebellion. The Shingon priest Kanjo was directed by the Emperor to bring an image of Fūdō, a tantric deity, to Narita in order to defeat the rebellion.
* After three weeks of continual fire offerings, the leader of the rebellion, Taira no Masakado, was killed by the Emperor's forces and peace was restored.

# There is another feature of tantric Buddhism that might be taken as evidence for the political role that its rites and spells were meant to play.

* Tantric buddhist ritual, as Ronald Davidson points out, is full of political metaphors.
* This imperial metaphor finds expression in the explicit relationship between the initiatory ritual of the *abhiseka* ̣ and the coronation ritual of kingship.
* The maṇḍalas which serve as objects of meditation, moreover, "are implicitly and explicitly articulations of a political horizon in which the central Buddha acts as the Rājādhirāja [Supreme Overlord] in relationship to the other figures of the maṇḍala".





# Buddhism and Society

* Buddhists initially abstained from justifying society or sanctifying it.
* Davidson suggests a radical change in the Buddhist attitude towards society.
* This change doesn't necessarily mean Buddhism freed itself from Brahmanism's influence.

# The Limits of Emancipation

* For centuries, South Asian Buddhism coexisted with Brahmanism, leaving matters of state and society to Brahmins.
* Buddhists gradually emancipated themselves from this tutelage.
* Admitting Buddhists could play societal roles, including rulers or counselors, marked a shift.
* Buddhists could now offer supernatural protection traditionally provided by Brahmins.

# Lingering Dependence on Brahmanism

* Despite these changes, Buddhists remained indebted to Brahmanism in various ways.
* South Asian Buddhists lacked realistic ideas about statecraft and relied on Brahmanical concepts.
* While Buddhism developed unique ideas like the ruler as a Bodhisattva, practical applications remained influenced by Brahmanism.

# Supernatural Protection and Tantric Buddhism

* In the realm of supernatural protection, Buddhism was more distant from Brahmanism but still influenced by Śaivism.
* Tantric Buddhism incorporated features directly from orthodox Brahmanical tradition.
* Vedic concepts, practices, and even mantras found a place in tantric Buddhism.

# The Unsuccessful Struggle for Independence

* Buddhists ultimately failed to assert themselves against Brahmins.
* Their attempts led them away from early Buddhist practices and closer to their rivals.
* This suggests that Buddhism's survival in South Asia required significant adjustments.
