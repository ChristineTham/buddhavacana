## 1 Seeing The Footprint

### 1.1 Introduction

* This chapter examines textual descriptions of a Buddha footprint, offering insight into its development as one of the thirty-two physical marks of a "great person," *mahāpuruṣ*a.
* The episode involves a brahmin named Droṇa encountering the Buddha's footprint, leading him to seek out the Buddha and engage in conversation. 
* Five versions of this discourse are studied: Dharmaguptaka, Theravāda, and three Mūlasarvāstivāda traditions.

### 1.3 The Nature Of An Awakened One

* The main message across the different versions is that the Buddha transcends categorization by the brahmin's limited understanding.
* The episode highlights the limitations of relying solely on physical marks to assess someone's true nature.
* The Buddha emphasizes the importance of understanding his awakened mind, aligning with the definition of a "great person" as one who has attained liberation.
* Passages from other discourses reinforce this connection between awakening and being a *mahāpuruṣ*a.

* The Cūḷ*ahatthipadopama-sutta* uses an elephant footprint simile to illustrate that seeing a footprint alone is insufficient for complete understanding; one must encounter the elephant itself (full awakening) for true knowledge.




## 1.4 The Different Footprints

* The Ekottarika-*āgama* version describes the Buddha's footprints as "sublime" and "very special".
* It lacks any reference to a wheelmark found in other versions.

* One Saṃyukta-*āgama* discourse depicts a wheel with a thousand spokes within the footprints, described as "extraordinary and never seen before."
* The other Saṃyukta-*āgama* discourse describes the appearance of a refined impression of a wheel with a thousand spokes, with straight spokes and round rim.

* The Aṅguttara-*nikāya* version reports that there were wheel-marks with a thousand spokes in the Buddha's footprints, complete with rim and hub.
* The Gāndhārī fragment version mentions a "wheel with thousand spokes in the footprints" and describes them as being "with all parts complete, brilliant and resplendent."

*  The descriptions of the footprint evolve across different versions: 
    * Ekottarika-*āgama*: Only the footprint itself.
    * Saṃyukta-*āgama* (SĀ²): Adds a wheel with a thousand spokes.
    * Saṃyukta-*āgama* (SĀ): Adds the rim to the wheel.
    * Aṅguttara-*nikāya*: Adds the hub to the wheel.
    * Gāndhārī fragment: Adds brilliance to the wheel.

* Early depictions of Buddha's footprints in art are simple, often featuring only a wheelmark.
* Later representations become more complex, with additional symbols added.
* This trend towards complexity is also seen in Pāli literature, where descriptions of Buddha's footprints evolve from simple marks to elaborate lists.

* The Ekottarika-*āgama* version might represent an earlier stage in the conception of the Buddha's footprints.
* The Gāndhārī fragment likely reflects a more evolved version.
* The development of the wheel imagery occurred early in Indian Buddhism, as evidenced by sculptures from Bhārhut and Sāñcī.

* Textual transmission is like a river, constantly evolving with contributions from various sources.
* The dating of the Gāndhārī fragment suggests that by that time, the footprint description had reached a specific stage of development within that tradition.

## 1.5 Problems With Marks On The Footprint

* The Pāli commentary struggles to reconcile the description of the footprints with the canonical description of the Buddha's soft feet.
* It proposes that the Buddha's feet are so soft they don't leave imprints unless he wills it for a specific purpose, like converting someone.
* A footprint without a wheel-mark could still be remarkable due to its form and how it reflects the walker's sublime nature.

##  Bare Footprints and Mental Defilements

* In another story, a brahmin's wife interprets bare footprints to reveal mental defilements like lust, anger, or delusion based on the way the person walks.
* This suggests that bare footprints were once seen as revealing inner qualities before the focus shifted to the wheel-mark.


## The Evolution of the Footprint Description

* The Gāndhārī version adds brilliance to the footprint, which Allon suggests might have originated from descriptions of a *cakravartin*'s wheel-treasure.
* This further embellishment highlights the potential evolution of the footprint description from a simple imprint to a more elaborate and symbolic representation. 


## 1.6 The Thousand Spokes

* The concept of a Buddha and a cakravartin are closely related.
* Descriptions of the cakra-*vartin*'s wheel-treasure often mention it as heralding the manifestation of other treasures.
* The wheel is central to the conception of the treasures of the wheel-turning king in various Indian traditions.

* A passage from the *Dīrgha-āgama* describes a golden wheel with a thousand spokes appearing before a king, signifying his status as a wheel-turning king.
* This description likely contains symbolism and humor, highlighting the peaceful conquest associated with the wheel-turning king.
* Other treasures mentioned include a flying elephant and horse, a magical gem, a beautiful woman, a wealthy steward, and a capable general or counsellor.

* The thousand spokes of the wheel are likened to the thousands of rays of sunshine.
* The term *sahasrāra*, meaning "thousand," is used to describe both the spokes of the wheel-treasure and the rays of a Buddha in Buddhist texts.
* The *Mahāvastu* directly compares the thousand-spoked wheel-treasure to the rising sun.

* It's unlikely that the idea of a thousand spokes originated from depictions of Buddha footprints, as it would be difficult to portray such a large number of spokes on a foot.
* The *Pratimālakṣaṇ*, a Buddhist work on iconometry, mentions the wheel on the soles of the feet but doesn't specify the number of spokes.

* Doctrinally, there are no clear connections between the thousand spokes and Buddhist teachings like the four noble truths or the noble eightfold path.
* The concept of a thousand spokes likely stems from sun imagery, where the thousand rays are a prominent feature.

* The brilliance associated with the sun is also linked to the wheel-mark on the Buddha's foot or in his footprints.
* The idea of a wheel with a thousand spokes likely originated from descriptions of the cakravartin's wheel-treasure and its association with the sun's rays.




## 1.7 The Wheel

* In early Buddhist art, depictions of the Buddha were often aniconic, meaning they didn't directly portray him.
* Footprints marked with a wheel became a common way to represent the Buddha's presence and invite devotion.
* This practice likely arose from a need to convey a sense of the Buddha's physical presence in his absence.
* The wheel symbol was added to make it clear that the footprints belonged to the Buddha, who set in motion the wheel of Dharma.
* Textual descriptions of the Buddha's footprints may have been influenced by artistic depictions.




## 2 A Vision Of The Thirty-Two Marks

* This chapter examines descriptions of the Buddha's feet within the context of listings of the thirty-two physical marks (*lakṣaṇa*) of a *mahāpuruṣa*.
* The author uses the discourse on Brahmāyus, found in Pāli and Chinese versions, to study these marks.

## 2.1 Introduction

* This section introduces the context for studying the thirty-two marks of a *mahāpuruṣa*, focusing on the Buddha's feet.
* It mentions different versions of the Brahmāyus discourse used in the analysis.
* The repetitive nature of the descriptions and their emphasis on the Buddha being a great man are highlighted.

## A Vision Of The Thirty-Two Marks (Continued)

* This section presents the dialogue between brahmin Uttara and his teacher, Brahmāyus, regarding the thirty-two marks of a *mahāpuruṣa*.
* It describes how Uttara examines the Buddha's body for these marks.
* The Buddha performs a psychic feat to reveal two marks Uttara was unsure about: the concealed part resembling a horse and his long wide tongue.

## A Vision Of The Thirty-Two Marks (Continued)

* This section details Uttara's observations of the Buddha's bearing, decorum, and behavior over four months.
* Uttara confirms to Brahmāyus that the Buddha possesses all thirty-two marks.
* He then lists each mark and explains how it manifests in the Buddha.

## 2.3 The Webbed Feet And The Protuberance

* The idea of webbed feet and hands on Buddha statues might be influenced by the way sculptors connected fingers and toes to prevent breakage. 
* This artistic practice could have led to textual descriptions reflecting this physical characteristic, even though it was not originally intended as a literal depiction.
* The description of a fleshy topknot on Buddha's head in texts might also be influenced by artistic depictions of gods and spiritual teachers with long hair styled in a topknot.

## 2.4 The Buddha'S Footprints On The Stairs From Heaven

* The motif of stairs in the story of Buddha's descent from heaven likely originated from aniconic art, where stairs were used to visually represent descent.
* This artistic representation then influenced textual accounts, leading to explanations for why Buddha needed stairs despite his supernormal abilities.
* The literal interpretation of the stair motif highlights how art can influence textual descriptions and lead to a more concrete understanding of symbolic representations.

## 2.5 The Buddha'S General Appearance

* Textual sources do not depict the Buddha as having long hair.
* Several Vinayas report instances where monks mistook Nanda for the Buddha, suggesting a similar appearance.
* Passages describe people failing to recognize the Buddha among other monks, indicating a lack of distinctive physical features.
* The depiction of thirty-two marks should not be taken literally as easily recognizable physical abnormalities.

## 2.6 The Significance Of The Thirty-Two Marks

* Recognizing the thirty-two marks requires training and close scrutiny, implying they are subtle nuances rather than obvious physical traits.
* The Brahmāyu*-sutta suggests that Uttara needed to learn how to recognize these marks, further supporting the idea of their subtlety.
* Early depictions of the Buddha's footprint likely emphasized its sublime nature without specific visible markings.
* Over time, the extraordinary nature of the Buddha's foot may have been expressed through visible markings on his soles and footprints, as seen in art examples like those from Kanaganahalli. 




## 2.7 The Thirty-Two Marks As Brahminical Lore

* The discourse to Droṇa and the Brahmāyu*-sutta*, along with their parallels, present the science of the footprint or else of the thirty-two marks as brahminical lore.
* This attribution does not carry any negative evaluation.
* Recognition of the thirty-two characteristics inspires Brahmayus with sufficient confidence in the Buddha to bring about his successful conversion.

* The same basic procedure can be seen in other discourses, such as the *Selasutta*.

* In these cases, brahmins ascertain that the Buddha possesses the thirty-two marks, leading to their conversion.
* The Buddha cooperates with brahmins' investigation of his physical form by displaying on purpose the two marks that require such cooperation, his tongue and his genitals.

* The *Mahāvastu* reports that, when the bodhisattva was about to be born, the *deva*s of the Pure Abodes taught the thirty-two marks to brahmins in order to enable them to recognize the bodhisattva.
* In the prologue to the Pārāyana*-vagga*, a brahmin sends his students to meet the Buddha and instructs them to ask telepathically about the brahmin's own marks.

* The Buddha correctly answers these questions, demonstrating his superior knowledge of brahminical lore.

* The function of the thirty-two marks as a means to inspire brahmins with faith recurs in other discourses, such as the Soṇadaṇḍ*a-sutta* and the Kūṭ*adanta-sutta*.

* In these cases, an eminent brahmin wishes to visit the Buddha but is stopped by other brahmins who argue that it is beneath his dignity.
* The eminent brahmin then replies with a list of the qualities of the recluse Gautama, which explicitly mentions the Buddha's possession of the thirty-two marks.

## 3 The Great Lineage Of Buddhas




## 3.1 Introduction

* This section discusses how early Buddhist discourses used the thirty-two marks of a great man to encourage brahmins to listen to the Buddha's teachings.

* The *Mahāvadāna-sūtra* and its parallels present a genealogy of Buddhas, highlighting the shared qualities and actions of all Buddhas, including Gautama.
* This genealogy serves to establish Gautama within a broader historical context and assures followers that there will be future Buddhas.

##  The Thirty-Two Marks in the *Mahāvadāna-sūtra*

* The *Mahāvadāna-sūtra* and its parallels describe the thirty-two marks of the Buddha Vipaśyin, the first Buddha in this genealogy.
* This description is part of a larger narrative about Vipaśyin's life, from his conception to his enlightenment.
* The text alternates between prose and verse, possibly reflecting an oral tradition where repetition aided memorization.

* The passage describes Vipaśyin's descent into his mother's womb, accompanied by miraculous events like earthquakes and brilliant lights.




# On Passing Away

* Upon death, she was reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# The Birth of the Buddha

* When the bodhisattva Vipaśyin was born, he emerged from the right side of his mother. 
* There was an earthquake and a light illuminated everything.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# The Mother's Purity

* The bodhisattva's mother held onto a tree branch when giving birth.
* Four *deva*s offered her scented water and reassured her.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# The Bodhisattva's Purity

* The bodhisattva emerged from the womb clean, without pollution.
* His purity was compared to a white pearl on white silk.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# The Seven Steps

* The bodhisattva took seven steps upon being born, without support.
* He surveyed the four directions and declared his intention to deliver sentient beings from suffering.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# Two Springs

* Two springs, one warm and one cool, welled up to enable the bodhisattva to bathe.
* This is an unchanging law for all Buddhas.

# The Fortune-Tellers' Predictions

* The fortune-tellers predicted two destinies for the prince: becoming a wheel-turning king or achieving enlightenment.
* They described the seven treasures that would come to him if he remained in the household.


# The Thirty-Two Marks

* The fortune-tellers examined the thirty-two marks of the crown prince, including level feet and wheelmarks on his soles.

## 3.3 Visual Elements In The Description Of Vipaśyin

* A special feature of the feet of Buddha Vipaśyin is their radiant and shiny nature.
* This echoes a qualification of the wheel-mark in the footprint of Buddha Gautama.
* The *Dīrghaāgama* version is detailed in its visual imagery, including the bodhisattva's emergence from his mother's right side.

## 3.4 The Marks And Dharmatā

* In the *Dīrghaāgama* description, the foot of the Buddha, like other marks, is not explicitly introduced as an invariable feature of all Buddhas.
* This differs from other qualities described earlier, which are invariably qualified as examples of "an unchanging law for all Buddhas".
* The Sanskrit fragment version uses *dharmatā* when introducing the description of the thirty-two marks, but this leads to inconsistencies.
* Applying *dharmatā* to the four outings of the prince results in making it a rule for all Buddhas to have a father named Bandhumat. 
* This contradicts an earlier part of the *Mahāvadāna-sūtra*, which lists different fathers for each Buddha.
* The application of *dharmatā* to the thirty-two marks likely came into being later, as part of the same textual development that led to the inconsistency regarding Bandhumat.
* At the stage reflected in the *Mahāpadāna-sutta* and its *Dīrghaāgama* parallel, the thirty-two marks were not yet presented as an indispensable requirement for Buddhahood.

## 3.5 The Birth Of A Buddha

* This section compares descriptions of Vipaśyin's birth with those of Gautama Buddha, highlighting divergences that suggest a late development in the narrative of both figures.
* It notes that claims made by Vipaśyin at birth, such as being his "last birth," are similar to later depictions of Gautama but contrast with early discourses depicting his struggle for awakening.
* The inclusion of compassion as a motivation for Vipaśyin's actions is seen as a later addition reflecting the evolving concept of the bodhisattva path.

##  Further Observations on the Narrative

* Inconsistencies in the accounts of Vipaśyin and Gautama's four outings suggest that these narratives developed over time, possibly influenced by artistic representations.
* The application of the thirty-two marks to both figures appears to be a later development, as evidenced by inconsistencies in their portrayal across different texts.




## 3.6 Seeing The Marks As A Means Of Conversion

* Once the thirty-two marks become integral to Buddhahood, their visual impact gains significance.
* This is evident in accounts like Rāṣṭrapāla's conversion where seeing the Buddha with these marks inspires him deeply.
* Different versions of Rāṣṭrapāla's story highlight the evolving role of visual impact.

* In some versions, hearing the Dharma is primary, while others emphasize the visual impact of the Buddha's marks leading to immediate conversion.
* This shift reflects a trend where the thirty-two marks become more prominent and accessible for all, not just those familiar with brahminical lore.

* The tale of Siṃha's stream-entry in the Ekottarika-*āgama* illustrates this gradual change. 
* Initially, reflection on oral instruction is emphasized, but later, surveying the Buddha's body from head to foot becomes significant.

* This increasing emphasis on visual impact aligns with the Buddha's apotheosis and the need for artistic representation to make his beauty visible.
* The cranial protuberance exemplifies how artistic conventions influenced the depiction of the marks.




## 3.7 Seeing The Marks As A Means Of Healing

* A vision of the Buddha's thirty-two marks can have a healing effect.
* The tale of nun Śubhā illustrates this: she plucks out her eye to shock a man infatuated with her beauty, and it is miraculously restored by seeing the Buddha.

## 4 The Karma Of The Wheel-Mark

### 4.1 Introduction
* Two versions of the Discourse on the Marks exist: a Pāli discourse (*Lakkhaṇa-sutta*) and a Chinese parallel (Discourse on the Thirty-two Marks).
* Both discourses list the thirty-two marks and state that one who possesses them will become either a wheel-turning king or a Buddha.
* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* adds that outside seers also recognize these marks but do not understand their karmic origins.
* It then describes the deeds performed by Gautama in past lives that led to his endowment with these marks.

* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* provides a detailed description of how the Buddha's feet, each adorned with a wheel having a thousand spokes, came to be. 
* This is explained through a story about the Buddha's past life as a bringer of happiness and protector who accumulated good karma.




## 4.3 Assessing The Lakkhaṇa-Sutta

* The verse portions summarizing the prose in the Lakkhaṇa-sutta are likely late additions, as indicated by Pāli metre and comparison with the Madhyama-*āgama* parallel.
* While the idea of karmic background for physical features is present in both Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda traditions, it's expressed differently.
* The detailed exposition in the *Dīgha-nikāya* likely originated as a commentary that became integrated into the discourse.

## 4.4 Introducing The Karmic Perspective

* The Lakkhaṇa-sutta acknowledges outside seers' knowledge of the thirty-two marks, suggesting brahminical lore was still relevant at the time.
* The Buddhist contribution lies in providing a karmic perspective on these marks, integrating them into Buddhist doctrine.
* This aligns with the central theme of karma in early Buddhism, evident in discourses like the Brahmāyu*-sutta* and the *Lakkhaṇa-saṃyutta*.
* The Cūḷ*akammavibhaṅga-sutta*, with its numerous parallels, demonstrates widespread interest in karmic relationships.
* The Lakkhaṇa-sutta's explanation of the wheel-mark connects past deeds of providing protection and abundant gifts to future attainment of a great following.
* This type of karmic connection is also found in other texts like the Art*haviniścaya-sūtra*, Lalita-*vistara*, Pañcavim*śatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā*, and Bodhi-*sattvabhūmi*.

## 4.5 The Marks In Their Karmic Setting

* This section discusses the karmic relationships established by the *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* for various physical marks.

* The text combines several of the thirty-two marks in a single karmic explanation, focusing on both the deeds from the past that led to the mark and what the mark signifies in relation to being a Buddha or a wheel-turning king.

* An example is the nature of the private parts, which according to the *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* is the karmic result of reuniting family members; it brings about having more than a thousand sons for a wheel-turning king and metaphorical "sons" (disciples) for a Buddha.

* The same mark can stand for quite different functions in the case of a wheel-turning king and a Buddha, even though it is expressed in the same terms.

* Comparisons with plants and animals are also relevant:
    * A body similar to a Banyan tree signifies balanced judgment from the past, leading to qualities conducive to mental balance.
    * Legs like an antelope represent quickness in learning, resulting in being quick in acquiring requisites as a Buddha.
    * A torso like a lion symbolizes bodily perfection and possessing qualities encouraged in others.

* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* also connects specific physical features to speech patterns:
    * A jaw like a lion signifies refraining from idle speech, resulting in not being defeated in debate.
    * High-raised ankles and body-hair that turns upwards are the result of speaking beneficial words, leading to becoming foremost among beings.

* Other marks and their karmic roots include:
    * Single hairs growing from single pores and white hair between the eyebrows signify sincerity, resulting in being obeyed by disciples.
    * A long tongue and a voice like a cuckoo represent abstention from harsh speech, leading to a persuasive voice.
    * Forty evenly spaced teeth signify abstaining from divisive speech, resulting in followers not becoming divided.

* Soft hands and feet are associated with the four bases of popularity (generosity, beneficial conduct, impartiality, soft speech), leading to well-disposed followers.

* Eyes of dark blue color and eyelashes like those of a cow result from looking at others openly and friendly, leading to being looked at with affection.
* A head shaped like a turban signifies assuming leadership in wholesome activities, resulting in the loyalty of disciples.

* Even teeth signify right livelihood, leading to purity among followers.

* Feet with a level tread are the result of steady and unwavering wholesome conduct, leading to not being obstructed externally or internally.





# The Karmic Roots of the Buddha's Marks

* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* connects specific physical marks of a Buddha with karmic deeds from past lives.
* These connections build on patterns found in other discourses like the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga-sutta, which outlines relationships between actions and results.
* Examples include: absence of anger leading to beauty, abstaining from killing resulting in long life, refraining from harming others leading to health, giving gifts bringing wealth, and inquiring about what is beneficial leading to wisdom.

# The Iconic Function of the Marks

* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta*'s unique contribution is integrating these marks into the karmic framework.
* The commentary, Sumaṅgalavilāsinī, emphasizes that the marks make the Buddha's qualities known to both deities and humans.
* The marks act as a visual embodiment of past merits and present qualities, functioning like a convex lens that focuses rays of light.

# Compassion in Early Buddhist Thought

* While the *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* lists numerous acts and qualities cultivated by the Buddha in past lives, compassion (*karuṇā*) is notably absent.
* This observation aligns with the finding that compassion, though central to later Buddhism, wasn't a prominent feature in early discourses related to the bodhisattva path.

## 4.6 Aspiring To Be Endowed With The Marks

* The karmic reading of the thirty-two marks, when considered alongside developments in texts like the Mahāvadāna-sūtra, reveals a trajectory where these marks become a script for the bodhisattva path.

* This connection arises because the identification of karmic deeds and the marks naturally leads to practical injunctions on how to acquire them.
* The Ekottarika-*āgama* explicitly connects giving (*dāna*) with Buddhahood and the thirty-two marks, highlighting the importance of perfections (*pāramitā*) in achieving these goals.

* This collection also depicts Maitreya's birth endowed with these marks, suggesting a link between past lives and future Buddhahood.
* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta*'s retrospective presentation of the marks can be read as a chart for future Buddhahood, leading to the concept of a bodhisattva career spanning multiple lifetimes.

* This idea, not present in early discourses except for the Ekottarika-*āgama*, likely arose from the connection between deeds and the marks outlined in the *Lakkhaṇa-sutta*.
* The prediction of future Buddhahood by fortune tellers based on the infant bodhisattva's physical marks further reinforces this concept.

* As the idea of a prolonged preparation for Buddhahood developed, the prediction shifted to a past life, with a former Buddha often giving it instead of a seer.
* This shift weakens the connection between the prediction and the thirty-two marks because these are only fully acquired in the last life.

* However, the marks remain important markers of progress on the bodhisattva path, as seen in accounts of Gautama's past life meeting Buddha Kāśyapa where he already possessed thirty of the marks.
* Texts like the Ugraparip*ṛcchā* and the Pratyutpannabuddhasaṃ-*mukhāvasthitasamādhi-sūtra* encourage aspiring to a Buddha body with these marks through meditation and virtuous deeds.

* The Mahāvibhāṣā explains that the marks serve as a design for the bodhisattva's future Buddha body, necessary to accommodate the mental qualities required for enlightenment.
* Humorous accounts like Devadatta branding wheel-marks on his feet in the Saṅ*ghabhedavastu* highlight the folly of seeking Buddhahood through superficial means.

## # 4.7 The Marks And Masculinity

* A male body is required for becoming a Buddha according to Buddhist thought.
* This idea emerged from the listing of five impossibilities for women found in the Bahudhātuka*-sutta*.
* Although initially about leadership conceptions, this doctrine gained significance with the emergence of the bodhisattva path.
*  Advanced bodhisattvas were also considered to require a male body.

* The type of *jātaka* tales involving past lives of the Buddha as a male likely influenced this belief. 
* These tales served as blueprints for the path to Buddhahood, inspiring a desire for a male body in future lives.
* This led to the conclusion that advanced bodhisattvas must leave behind womanhood and be reborn as males.

* The Buddha's male organ being "concealed in a sheath" likely refers to its retractable nature, similar to a horse's.
* This mark signifies chastity and purity for a Buddha.
* It allows for fathering children as a wheel-turning king while representing aloofness from sexuality as a Buddha.



# Conclusion

* The Buddha's footprint was originally depicted without marks.
* The wheel-marked footprint emerged as a convenient marker of the Buddha's presence and an object for devotion.
* This depiction influenced textual accounts, leading to descriptions of the wheel treasure with a thousand spokes.

#  The Thirty-Two Marks: From Subtle Nuances to Visible Embodiment

* The original conception of the thirty-two marks focused on subtle physical nuances detectable only by trained brahmins.
* Early discourses present these marks as a tool for converting brahmins.
* Visualization and depiction in art led to the evolution of some mark descriptions, making them more visible and evident.
* This visibility expanded the salvific function of the marks beyond brahmins to serve as a means of conversion and inspiration for all.

# The Marks as a Script for the Bodhisattva Path

* In the *Mahāvadāna-sūtra*, the thirty-two marks become a necessary requirement for Buddhahood.
* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* presents a karmic perspective on the marks, linking them to specific wholesome deeds and past karma.
* This karmic view, combined with the genealogy of Buddhas, opens the door to conceiving of the bodhisattva path over multiple lifetimes.

#  Predictions and Vows: Embryonic Stages of the Bodhisattva Ideal

* The idea that past Buddhas predict the future success of a bodhisattva emerges from narratives like the prediction of Maitreya's Buddhahood by Gautama.
* Gautama's vow to become a Buddha under Kāśyapa in the *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* further illustrates this development.

#  Early Discourses as Windows into Buddhist Thought


* Early discourses offer valuable insights into the evolution of the bodhisattva ideal.
* Comparing versions from different reciter traditions helps to understand early stages in Buddhist doctrine and practice.
