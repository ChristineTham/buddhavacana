# The Revival Of The Bhikkhunī Order And The Decline Of The Sāsana

* This article explores the revival of the *bhikkhun*ī order in Theravāda traditions and its supposed relationship to a decline of the Buddha's dispensation.

* Early Buddhist discourse positively evaluates the existence of an order of *bhikkhun*īs, contrasting with a "prediction of decline" suggesting that establishing this order would lead to a decline of the Buddha's dispensation (*sāsana*).

# The Prediction Of Decline

* This section analyzes a Saṃyukta-ā*gama discourse highlighting the importance of all four assemblies (bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers) in the Buddhist community.
* It emphasizes that learned and virtuous *bhikkhun*īs were considered valuable assets to the community.

* The passage from the *Mahāparinibbāna-sutta* states that the Buddha would not pass away until he had disciples from all four assemblies who were competent, disciplined, self-confident, and learned.
* A discordant note emerges in a discourse in the Aṅguttara-nikāya, which predicts that establishing an order of *bhikkhun*īs will shorten the lifespan of the Dharma by half.

* This prediction has not come true, leading to reinterpretations. However, the *bhikkhun*ī order itself outlasted the prediction.
* Evidence suggests that *bhikkhun*īs existed in India until at least the 8th century and were brought to Sri Lanka during Asoka's reign.



# The Problem with Associating Bhikkhunīs with Decline

* There's no conclusive inscriptional evidence for the existence of bhikkhunī orders in Southeast Asia. 
* While some inscriptions mention female renunciants, they don't definitively prove the continuation of bhikkhunī ordination.
* Attributing the decline of Dharma to the existence of bhikkhunīs contradicts canonical teachings that see them as integral to the Buddha's dispensation.

# The Buddha's Teachings on the Longevity of Dharma

* According to a discourse in the Saṃyutta-nikāya, the longevity of Dharma depends on respect for the teacher, Dharma, community, training, and concentration by all four assemblies: bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, and female lay followers.
* This passage suggests that the behavior of each assembly member, rather than their mere existence, determines the fate of Dharma.

# A Different Reading of the Prediction

* The prediction associating bhikkhunī existence with Dharma's decline might not be authentic. 
* It could be understood as a reflection of societal challenges faced by women in ancient India, illustrated by similes about vulnerable households and diseased fields.

# Impact on Attitudes Towards Bhikkhunīs

* The prediction has influenced attitudes towards bhikkhunīs in Theravāda traditions, fueling fears of decline associated with their revival.
* The involvement of Mahāyāna bhikkhunīs in revival efforts further intensifies these fears due to perceived violations of Theravāda monastic jurisprudence.

## The Mahāyāna Threat

* Chinese sources report that Sri Lankan *bhikkhun*īs established the ordination lineage in China in the early fifth century. 
* Details about the specific monastery, Vinaya used, and subsequent adherence to this lineage are unknown.
* A Theravāda *Vinaya* was translated into Chinese but later lost. The Dharmaguptaka *Vinaya* became mandatory for both *bhikkhu*s and *bhikkhun*īs in China from the eighth century onwards.

## Apprehensions Towards the Mahāyāna

* The re-establishment of the *bhikkhun*ī order in Sri Lanka with the help of Chinese *bhikkhun*īs at the 1998 Bodhgayā ordination has raised concerns due to the Chinese *bhikkhun*īs' affiliation with the Mahāyāna.
* These apprehensions stem from the Theravāda tradition's historical perception of the Mahāyāna as a threat, having defended itself against perceived intrusions throughout its early history.

## Historical Context: The Nikāyasaṅgraha

* The *Nikāyasaṅgraha*, compiled by the head of the Sri Lankan monastic community in the 14th century, presents a historical account of Buddhism's development, emphasizing the defense of Theravāda against Mahāyāna influences.
* The text recounts instances where "Vaitulya doctrines [i.e., Mahāyāna teachings]" were brought to Sri Lanka and suppressed by Buddhist kings.

## A Story of Degeneration

* The *Nikāyasaṅgraha* narrates a story about a Sammittiya Nikāya *bhikkhu* who promoted indulgence in liquor, associating it with the three gems (Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha), and wearing blue robes as a symbol of his unorthodox beliefs.
* This narrative portrays the Mahāyāna in a negative light, contrasting it with traditional Theravāda values.

## The Bodhgayā Ordination

* Despite concerns about Mahāyāna influence, the Bodhgayā *bhikkhun*ī ordination was conducted in a way that emphasized Theravāda practices:
    * Candidates received Theravāda robes and bowls.
    * They did not take bodhisattva vows typically associated with Mahāyāna ordination.

## Understanding the Mahāyāna

* The Mahāyāna is a religious vocation, not a monastic lineage or a result of a schism.
* It is open to both monastics and laity, and does not require ordination.

## Bodhisattva Path in Theravāda

* The path of the bodhisattva is recognized within Theravāda traditions.
* Some prominent Sri Lankan *bhikkhu*s have been known practitioners of this path.

## Conclusion

* The Chinese *bhikkhun*īs' involvement in the Bodhgayā ordination transmitted an ordination lineage, not a vocation. Their Mahāyāna affiliation does not invalidate their transmission.
* Apprehensions about Mahāyāna influence stem from historical perceptions and a sense of threat associated with the existence of *bhikkhun*īs.

## The Theravāda Sense Of Identity

*  The term Theravāda translates as "Sayings of the Elders."
*  Central aspects of Theravāda identity are the Pāli canon and Pāli as its liturgical language.
*  Rules in the *Vinaya* part of the Pāli canon are of central importance for monastic members.

## The Degree To Which Adherence To Vinaya Rules Is Perceived As Crucial

*  Theravādins adhere strictly to the *Vinaya* rules, even if it means finding creative solutions within the parameters of the rules.
* An example is the "requisite cloth" solution for having more than three robes.

## Ramifications For Reviving The Bhikkhunī Order

*  Proposing amendments to the *Vinaya* rules to allow for reviving the *bhikkhun*ī ordination is unacceptable from a traditional viewpoint.
* Such a suggestion misses out on a central aspect of Theravāda identity, namely strict adherence to the Pāli canon and its regulations.
* The *Vinaya* is seen as giving life force to the Buddha's dispensation.

##  The Theravāda Attitude Towards Legal Matters

*   The community of *bhikkhu*s does not have the right to change the *Vinaya*, but must confine itself to practicing according to it.
* Bhikkhu Buddhadāsa stated that Theravādins are against revoking, changing or altering the original *Vinaya*.


## The Case Of Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda Tradition

*  Women have received higher ordination from Chinese *bhikkhun*īs, but acceptance from tradition has remained controversial.
* The Dalai Lama gave permission for these *bhikkhun*īs to perform rituals based on the Dharmaguptaka code of rules, translated into Tibetan.
* This permission sets them apart from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition and hasn't been put into practice.

##  The Theravāda Perspective

* Traditionalists would not object to a woman taking Chinese Dharmaguptaka ordination but wouldn't recognize her as a Theravāda *bhikkhun*ī.
* The question is whether such a *bhikkhun*ī will be recognized as a member of the Theravāda community.


## Legal Aspects

* If the rules in the Theravāda *Vinaya* render a revival of the *bhikkhun*ī order legally impossible, it stands little chance of approval by traditionalists.
* If a revival can be done without direct infringement of the rules, there is no real basis for refusing to accept that the *bhikkhun*ī order has been resurrected.

## Dual Ordination

* The chief question regarding the validity of the dual ordination at Bodhgayā is whether officiating female preceptors can be recognized as *bhikkhunīs* from a Theravāda viewpoint.
* One objection concerns the uncertainty of the unbroken transmission of the *bhikkhunī* lineage in China, which applies equally to *bhikkhu* lineages in South and Southeast Asia due to the impossibility of proving continuous transmission.

##  Ritual Boundary for Ordination (Sīmā)

* The Dharmaguptaka *Vinaya* lists more markers for establishing a sīmā than the Theravāda *Vinaya*, potentially rendering ordinations carried out using these markers invalid from a Theravāda perspective.
* It is uncertain whether such markers were used in past Chinese ordinations, and differences exist even within Theravāda countries regarding sīmā markers.

##  Formulations for Establishing Sīmā

* Differences exist between Dharmaguptaka and Theravāda formulations for establishing the sīmā, with the former's difference likely affecting the validity of Chinese ordinations.
* Minor differences also exist within Theravāda traditions themselves.

## Language and Pronunciation in Legal Acts

* The Pāli formulas used in Theravāda traditions are the outcome of development, as the Buddha and his disciples did not speak Pāli.
* While commentaries emphasize correct pronunciation, this can become self-defeating, as seen in the practice of replacing candidates' and preceptors' names with Nāga and Tissa to avoid mispronunciation.

##  Nānasaṃvāsa (Different Community)

* The legal problems regarding sīmā, language, and pronunciation converge on the issue of whether officiating female preceptors are *nānasaṃvāsa*, or "different community," vis-à-vis Theravāda monastics.
* Being *nānasaṃvāsa* would make their ordinations invalid from a traditional Theravāda perspective.

##  Differences in Bhikkhunī Rules

* The Dharmaguptaka *Vinaya* has more rules for *bhikkhunīs* than the Theravāda *Vinaya*, making them de facto *nānasaṃvāsa*.
* This contrasts with *bhikkhu*s in South and Southeast Asia, who share essentially the same *Vinaya* text.

##  Potential Resolution

* The difference in rules could be overcome if *bhikkhunīs* adopt the Theravāda *Vinaya*, becoming *samānasaṃvāsa*.
* The ordination by Theravāda *bhikkhu*s after the dual ordination could then be seen as a formal act of acceptance, similar to daḷhī*kamma*.

## Conclusion

* While arguments can be made for accepting the *bhikkhunī* lineage from Sri Lanka via China, they are not compelling.
* Traditional circles rely on both the *Vinaya* and its commentaries, making acceptance difficult due to concerns about longstanding continuity and adherence to legal principles.

# Taking Refuge

* Incorrect pronunciation of the refuge formula jeopardizes the legal validity of going forth.
* Establishing proper ritual space and language is important for traditionalists.
* Different robes and Vinaya texts create an alien impression, making it difficult for traditionalists to accept ordinations from lineages with different practices.

# Validity of Higher Ordination

* The issue of ordination validity is contentious even within Theravada traditions that share the same Vinaya.
* In Thailand, Dhammayuttikanikāya members do not recognize the validity of Mahānikāya ordinations.
* This separation allows each nikāya to conduct ordinations independently without needing recognition from the other.

# Bhikkhuni Ordination in Theravada Traditions

* For bhikkhuni ordination to thrive, cooperation from bhikkhus is crucial.
* Without bhikkhu acceptance and participation, sustaining bhikkhuni ordinations becomes difficult.
* Currently, Sri Lanka is the only country where a section of the bhikkhu community openly supports bhikkhuni ordinations.

# Single Ordination

* The Cullavagga describes Mahāpajāpati Gotamī's ordination based on eight principles (garudhammas).
* The Buddha proclaimed these garudhammas to Ānanda, who conveyed them to Mahāpajāpatī.
* One garudhamma stipulates that bhikkhuni ordination requires a two-year training period and subsequent request for ordination from both bhikkhu and bhikkhuni communities.

# Significance of Garudhammas

* The term "garudhamma" carries different meanings in the Vinaya.
* In the context of the eight principles, it refers to recommendations rather than rules.
* Unlike other Vinaya rules, garudhammas are not laid down in response to specific events but are pronounced in advance.
* They are presented as principles to be respected, not punishable offenses.



# The Sixth Garudhamma

- This principle stipulates that a woman wishing to receive bhikkhuni ordination must have first undergone a two-year training period as a sikkhamana.
- She should then request higher ordination from both communities, the bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis.
- Failing to fulfill this requirement does not invalidate the higher ordination.

# The Role of Bhikkhus in Bhikkhuni Ordination

- The sixth garudhamma is concerned with the behavior that should be adopted by sikkhamanas and bhikkhunis, not bhikkhus.
- It aims to prevent bhikkhunis from giving higher ordination on their own or sikkhamanas from taking ordination from bhikkhunis without any involvement of the bhikkhus.

# The Buddha's Prescription for Bhikkhu Ordination

- After the promulgation of the sixth garudhamma, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī asked the Buddha how she should proceed in relation to her followers.
- The Buddha explicitly prescribed that the bhikkhus can ordain bhikkhunis: "Bhikkhus, I prescribe the giving of the higher ordination of bhikkhunis by bhikkhus."

# Two Prescriptions for Bhikkhu Ordination

- The first prescription given to bhikkhus on the matter of bhikkhuni ordination was given after the promulgation of the sixth garudhamma and the Buddha's preference for dual ordination.
- This makes it clear that even though dual ordination is preferable, if this is not possible because a bhikkhuni community able to carry out the legal act of conferring higher ordination is not in existence, single ordination of bhikkhunis by bhikkhus is the proper way to proceed.

# The Second Prescription and Cooperation with Bhikkhunis

- When the problem of interviewing female candidates arose, the Buddha gave another prescription that the bhikkhus can carry out bhikkhuni ordination even if the candidate has not cleared herself in front of the bhikkhus but rather has done so already in the community of bhikkhunis.
- This regulation refers to a candidate who has "cleared herself in the community of bhikkhunis."

# Legal Validity of Bhikkhu Ordination

- The canonical Vinaya seems clear that bhikkhus are permitted to ordain bhikkhunis in a situation where no bhikkhuni order able to confer higher ordination is in existence.
- This implies that the higher ordination carried out at Bodhgayā fulfills the legal requirements of the Theravāda Vinaya.

# Conclusion

- The combination of higher ordinations adopted for the 1998 Bodhgayā procedure cannot be faulted.
- The order of bhikkhunis has been revived in Sri Lanka and stands on firm legal foundations.

## Actual Decline

* The current situation of nuns in Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand is compared to the historical position of *bhikkhunīs* described in Pali texts.
*  Sri Lankan women could become nuns as *dasasil mātās*, a tradition originating from Burmese *thila shin*.
* These traditions occupy an ambiguous space between laity and monasticism, lacking full recognition and facing limitations compared to monks (*bhikkhus*).

## The Situation of Nuns in Different Countries

* *Dasasil mātās* in Sri Lanka wear ochre robes similar to monks but with differences, and their precepts differ from both lay people and monks.
* Burmese *thila shin*, the origin of the *dasasil mātā* tradition, face even greater challenges, often lacking resources and struggling to maintain all ten precepts.
* Thai *mae chi*s wear white robes, resembling laity, take only eight precepts, and are not considered fully ordained.

## Challenges Faced by Nuns

* *Mae chi*s lack important monastic structures, government benefits given to monks, and the right to vote.
* Despite a long history, they lack formal religious legitimacy and support from the Thai government and Sangha.
* While some individual *mae chi*s achieve prominence, their overall situation remains disadvantaged compared to monks.

## The Impact of Bhikkhunī Ordination 

*  The revival of *bhikkhunī* ordination in Sri Lanka shows improvements for nuns, with greater acceptance and participation in rituals.
* However, some nuns hesitate to take higher ordination due to concerns about disrupting existing social structures and relationships with monks.
* There are fears that *bhikkhunī* ordination could lead to conflict with monks who oppose it, potentially jeopardizing the support systems nuns rely on.

## The Importance of Bhikkhunīs

* From a canonical perspective, the absence of *bhikkhunīs* contributes to the decline of Buddhism, as all four assemblies (monks, nuns, male and female laity) are essential for a flourishing community.
* Burma currently lacks a *bhikkhunī* assembly, while Thailand faces challenges due to opposition from monks.
* Sri Lanka has overcome this "border country" condition with the revival of *bhikkhunī* ordination, though official recognition is still pending.

## Learnedness as a Contribution

* According to the stanza, learnedness is how *bhikkhunīs* illuminate the community.
* This is significant considering the traditional role of women in ancient India as wives and mothers.
* Being learned means combining theoretical knowledge with practical realization.
* Far from bringing decline, the presence of *bhikkhunīs* is required to prevent it according to this and other canonical passages.

## Four Illuminations

* The discourse states that four types of individuals illuminate the community: a competent, disciplined, self-confident, learned, upholder of the Dharma, practitioner of the Dharma who follows the Dharma.
* These four are: a *bhikkhu*, a *bhikkhunī*, a male lay follower, and a female lay follower.

## Illumination Defined

* One who is competent and self-confident, learned, an upholder of the Dharma, and lives according to the Dharma is considered an illumination of the community.
* A virtuous *bhikkhu*, a learned *bhikkhunī*, a male lay follower with faith, and a female lay follower with faith are all illuminations of the community.
