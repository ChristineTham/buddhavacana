# Foreword: The Vipassananāvādā

* This book analyzes textual sources of 20th-century Theravāda meditation theory, focusing on the *vipassanāvāda*, a specific interpretation of meditation concepts that has become dominant in Theravāda Buddhism.
* The key points of the vipassanāvāda are:
    * The Buddha taught two systems of meditation, samatha and vipassanā.
    * Samatha is pre-Buddhist, dangerous due to attachment to bliss, and unnecessary because vipassanā alone can develop access concentration.
    * Vipassanā is the true key to liberation taught by the Buddha.

* This method is primarily taught in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, emphasizing moment-to-moment awareness of mind-body phenomena.
* The author argues that a historical approach to understanding these teachings is crucial and often overlooked by practitioners.
* He proposes starting with simpler, shorter passages on satipaṭṭhāna as they are likely more authentic and represent earlier stages of development.

* This involves examining pre-Buddhist meditation practices and comparing the Nikāyas (Theravāda) with Āgamas (other early Buddhist schools) to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of these teachings.

## The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

*  The author discovered a potential earlier perspective on satipaṭṭhāna in shorter texts within the Saṁyutta Nikāya.
* This led to an exploration of early Abhidhamma texts and their relationship to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, considering sectarian influences.
* The study expanded to include later commentarial periods to understand how traditions adapted satipaṭṭhāna.

## Chapter 1 The Meaning Of 'Buddha'

* To study satipaṭṭhāna in Chinese translations, the author needed a deeper understanding of Āgamas and other early Buddhist sources.
* Comparing these collections revealed strong connections but also differences that required resolution.

##  The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

* The author developed "the gist," a theory about the relationship and hierarchy of texts in early Buddhist canons, reflecting doctrinal importance and historical provenance.
* This methodology was applied to the study of satipaṭṭhāna, providing evidence for the gist's principles and demonstrating its usefulness.
* Although interconnected, the two studies can be considered independently.

## The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

* Historical criticism is presented as a process of moving towards clarity and away from dogmatism.
* Multiple criteria are used synergistically to increase confidence in conclusions.

## The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

* The author acknowledges the contributions of Bhikkhu Fa Qing, Roderick Bucknell, and Venerable Anālayo.
* Consistency in rendering technical terms is maintained, with Pali preferred due to familiarity.


## The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

* Texts with similar titles are distinguished by spelling out names and affiliations.
* Referring to texts by language can be misleading; classification by school is preferable whenever possible.

## The Gist: The Hidden Structure Of The Dhamma

* References are given to known versions of texts, usually Pali and Chinese, but this doesn't imply the presence of specific terms or ideas in all versions.
* Historical criticism is presented as a process that can deepen faith rather than undermine it.




## Buddha.

* The word 'Buddha' is precious and evokes a powerful spiritual charisma. 
* It represents an enlightened being who walked the earth nearly 2500 years ago.

## 1.1 The Ambiguity Of Tradition

* Buddhists believe that the Dhamma descends from the Buddha through tradition.
* This implies a responsibility to uphold the Buddha's teachings and avoid practices contrary to them.
* Cultural variations in Buddhism are acceptable, but perversions of the teachings, such as justifying war with Buddhist concepts, are unacceptable.
* It is crucial to critically examine traditions and not blindly accept them.

* Existing schools of Buddhism share common teachings while also having divergent ones.
* These differences are acknowledged by the schools themselves through polemical texts.
* A neutral methodology is needed to approach these teachings, considering the textual tradition and lived experience of Buddhists.

## 1.2 The Death Of Myth

* All Buddhist schools justify their doctrines with myths, despite Buddhism's constant evolution over 2500 years.
* These myths should be seen as expressions of religious conviction rather than historical facts. They offer a complementary perspective to history by revealing the devotees' feelings about the teachings.

## Reason Displaces Myth

* History demonstrates that reason eventually replaces myth as humans seek understanding through rational explanations.
* While myths fulfill a need for meaning and communal identity, reason empowers individuals to approach truth.
* As rational explanations emerge, maintaining incompatible belief structures becomes increasingly difficult, leading to the decline of myths.

## The Historical Study of Buddhism

* Early historical studies of Buddhism faced confusion due to competing myths from different schools and Hinduism.
* Scholars questioned the factual basis of these myths and sought to establish a clear historical picture of Buddhism's origins and development.
* Archaeological findings and comparisons between Buddhist traditions across different regions helped piece together a more accurate understanding of Buddhism's history.

## The Common Heritage of Early Buddhism

* Samuel Beal's work in 1882 highlighted the similarities between Pali Suttas and Chinese Āgamas, suggesting they are essentially the same set of texts.
* Later scholars like M. Anesaki and Chizen Akanuma further confirmed this finding through comparative studies of early Buddhist discourses.
* These early Suttas, predating sectarian divisions, represent presectarian Buddhism and form a common heritage for all schools.

## Sectarian Buddhism and the Role of Hermeneutics

* Later texts like Jātakas, Abhidhammas, and Mahāyāna sūtras are considered sectarian Buddhism as they contain doctrines not found in the early Suttas.
* These later teachings reflect responses to changing cultural, social, and religious contexts, demonstrating the ongoing process of interpreting and adapting Buddhism.
* Each generation faces the challenge of hermeneutics, finding meaning and relevance in the Dhamma within their own time and place.

## The Value of Understanding Buddhist History

* Recognizing the historical basis of Buddhism helps appreciate the common ground between different schools.
* Traditional myths about the origin of Buddhist texts primarily serve to authenticate specific doctrinal positions within each school.
* While acknowledging the religious significance of myths, it's important to distinguish essential teachings from later additions and interpretations.

# Chapter 2 The Gist 1—Three Strata Of Early Texts

* The gist is a hypothesis on the origin and development of Buddhist texts aiming to identify the teachings of the Buddha within vast collections.

* It encompasses Suttas, Vinayas, and Abhidhammas from various schools and languages, offering a synoptic presentation of their relationships.
*  It proposes a revaluation of the term 'sutta' based on its earliest usage.

* The gist is a theory because it is not definitive but addresses a genuine problem, explains facts plausibly, and suggests further inquiry.

* It aims to systematically investigate similarities and differences between Pali and Chinese collections using structural principles from within the texts themselves.
*  It emphasizes the influence of the Dhamma's structure on the canon's structure, contrasting the balanced architecture of teachings with sprawling collections.

* The gist offers a clear method for studying fundamental Buddhist teachings by establishing a hierarchy of significance within early scriptures.


# 2.1 Before The Buddha

* Pre-Buddhist literary models likely influenced the organization of early Buddhist scriptures.
* The Brahmanical tradition, particularly the three Vedas (Ṛg, Sāman, Yajur), potentially provided a model for Buddhist textual structure.

* The Vedic *vagga*, a group of ten verses, might have influenced the Buddhist *vagga* as a basic organizational unit.
* The triune form of the Vedas (one central work and two supplements) reflects religious Trinities common in antiquity.

*  Terms like *aṅga* ('section') and *sutta* (short doctrinal statement) are found in both Vedic and Jain traditions, suggesting shared influences.
* Jain scriptures also use the term *aṅga* for texts organized in groups of multiples of three, further supporting potential influence on Buddhist textual structure.

## 2.2 The First Discourses

*  The earliest Buddhist texts can be identified through concordance studies, focusing on textual lineages rather than schisms.
* A fundamental division in Buddhist teachings is between Dhamma (doctrine) and Vinaya (monastic discipline), with specialized groups of monks studying each area.
* Doctrinal teachings found in the Vinaya are significant as they were likely known to all monks and nuns from the earliest days, before specialization became necessary.

##  

* Several versions of early Vinayas exist across different Buddhist traditions, providing valuable material for comparative study.
* The Theravāda Vinaya contains important doctrinal teachings, particularly in the first chapter of the Mahāvagga, including the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta, and Ādittapariyāya Sutta.

## 

* These discourses are also found in other collections like Nikāyas and Āgamas, suggesting their widespread recognition as fundamental teachings.
* The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is particularly prevalent, existing in numerous versions across different Buddhist languages.
* The presence of these discourses in both Vinaya and Sutta collections suggests they were central to the earliest Buddhist narrative.

## 

* The Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra, found in the Sarvāstivādin tradition, presents a challenge to the theory that these doctrinal passages originated in the Vinaya.
* This discourse, closely related to the Pali version but lacking Vinaya elements, could have been originally part of the Vinaya or vice versa.

## 

* In the early years of Buddhism, there would have been a limited number of teachings known by all monks and nuns.
* Over time, specialization in Dhamma and Vinaya emerged, but both areas remained interconnected.
* The presence of doctrinal passages within Vinayas suggests they are remnants of this shared early doctrinal body.



## 2.3 The Gāthā Theory

* Some scholars believe that the earliest Buddhist teachings are found in verse collections like the Aṭṭhaka and Pārāyana of the Sutta Nipāta.
* This theory argues that the language of these verses is archaic, they are referenced in prose Nikāyas, have their own commentary (Niddesa), use less technical terms, and depict monks living as hermits rather than in monasteries.

* The author disagrees with this theory, arguing that verse tends to be archaic regardless of its age, references in prose Nikāyas only confirm a chronological relationship in specific cases, the Niddesa is similar to Abhidhamma texts and likely stems from the same period, less technical terms are characteristic of poetry, and the shift from forest life to monasteries is depicted in the texts themselves.

* The author concludes that the traditional belief that the prose discourses represent the earliest teachings is more plausible, supported by the prominence of these teachings and their focus on core Buddhist doctrines like the four noble truths.




## 2.4 The Earliest Collection

* This section explores which collection of Buddhist discourses is the earliest.
* It uses concordance of texts and traditions as criteria for determining the earliest collection.
* Major collections include Theravāda Nikāyas, Sarvāstivāda Āgamas, and other Āgamas (in Chinese).

## 2.4.1 Early Chronology of Buddhism

* The early chronology of Buddhism is unclear.
* Dates for the Buddha's passing vary between traditions.
* Schisms within Buddhism are difficult to date precisely.

## 2.4.2 Emergence of Schools

* Buddhist schools arose due to geographical spread and doctrinal differences.
* The first schism was between Theravāda and Mahāsaṅghika, differing on the status of arahants.
* The Sarvāstivāda schism focused on the conception of time.

## 2.4.3 Comparing Collections

*  The traditions claim all four collections were created simultaneously, but this is unlikely.
* Structural analysis offers insights into the relative ages of the collections.

## 2.4.4 Structural Analysis

* The Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha allows for comparison with Theravāda and other Āgamas.
* The Saṁyuttas show the closest structural relationship, suggesting they were largely settled before sectarian divisions.
* Majjhimas and Dīghas have less structural congruence, indicating later formation.

## 2.4.5 Conclusion

* Based on structural analysis, the Saṁyutta is likely the earliest collection.
* This conclusion is supported by the high degree of overlap in content within its structural groupings.

## 2.5 The First Abhidhamma

* Three early Abhidhamma texts (Vibhaṅga, Dharmaskandha, Śāriputrābhidharma) share much content and likely derived from a common ancestor (*Vibhaṅga Mūla*).
* These texts are considered fundamental to the Abhidhamma by both Pali and Sanskrit traditions.

## 2.6 Some Problems

* **Objection:** Traditions might have invented myths about earliest teachings to reinforce their claims.
* **Response:** This objection is weak for collections and Abhidhamma, as traditions didn't emphasize historical priority. For discourses, the widespread agreement suggests authenticity.
* **Problem:** Later borrowing between traditions could explain similarities.
* **Response:**  Shared heritage is a more plausible explanation, supported by detailed analysis. The Bhāra Sutta example demonstrates this plausibility.

## Chapter 3 The Gist 2—The Agreement Of The Three Strata

* Earliest discourses are found in the Saṁyutta, suggesting they are the root texts from which the collection and other Buddhist teachings developed.

## 3.1 The Seeds Of The Saṁyutta

* The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta may have been the first discourse in the Saṁyutta Nikāya, as suggested by its position in some traditions.
* This is supported by the title "Spoken by the Tathāgata" which may have originally referred to a collection of discourses directly from the Buddha.

* The Sarvāstivādins claim that the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta was the first discourse recited at the First Council, corroborating the theory of its primacy.
* This account describes how Venerable Mahā Kassapa requested Venerable Ānanda to recite the Suttas, starting with the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya details the compilation of the Saṁyutta based on early discourses like the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta and the Ādittapariyāya Sutta.
* It lists categories like "spoken by disciples" and "spoken by the Buddha," aligning with the structure of the existing Saṁyutta.

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya also mentions a mātikā, a list of contents for the Abhidhamma presented by Venerable Mahā Kassapa.
* This mātikā includes topics like the 37 wings to awakening, dhamma topics, and titles of Abhidhamma books.

* The connection between the Buddha's exhortation to recite the aṅgas at his passing away and the absence of mention of them in First Council accounts remains unclear.





## 3.2 The Two Saṁyuttas

* The existing Saṁyuttas are disordered, differing between Pali and Chinese versions.
* Similarities suggest a common inheritance, while differences may be due to divergence over time.

* 'Saṁyutta' means 'connected,' referring to collections of discourses on a theme. 
* It can refer to the large collection ('Saṁyutta Nikāya') or individual topics (e.g., 'Khandha-saṁyutta').
* 'Vagga' has two meanings: 'book' for major divisions and 'chapter' within saṁyuttas.

* Comparison between Chinese Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta Āgama and Pali Theravāda Saṁyutta Nikāya reveals discrepancies in the order of Vaggas (books).
* Most material is distributed differently, but core content remains similar.
* The Nidāna and Sagāthāvaggas have moved positions.

* Internal evidence suggests reshuffling within the Theravāda canon.
* The Bhikkhu-saṁyutta's position in the Pali version seems misplaced compared to the Chinese version.
* This may be due to misshelving, leading to a separation from its natural pair, the Bhikkhunī-saṁyutta.

* The overall structure of the Saṁyutta Nikāya/Āgama roughly corresponds with the four noble truths.
* This correspondence is more apparent in the Chinese version.

* The 37 wings to awakening may have been abstracted from the Magga Vagga topics, rather than the other way around.
* This explains some puzzling features of the list, such as the repetition of five spiritual faculties and powers.

* The Sarvāstivāda Bala-saṁyukta contains a substantial collection of texts on various 'powers,' while the Theravāda version is largely redundant.
* Comparing the Indriya-saṁyutta (faculties) and Bala-saṁyutta (powers) shows different teachings, except for the overlapping five faculties and powers.

* The entire Saṁyutta can be seen as a massive exposition of the four noble truths.
* This traditional interpretation is supported by the structure and content of the collection.
* The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, containing the first discourse on the four noble truths, may have been the seed around which the collection crystallized.

* Ambiguity in the position of the Sacca-saṁyutta suggests that imposing linear textual structure on the organic structure of the Dhamma is difficult.
* The correlation with the four noble truths was important for early compilers but became less prominent over time.

## 3.3 The Root Abhidhamma Topics

* The earliest Abhidhammas share similarities with the Saṁyutta in terms of fundamental doctrines.
* Frauwallner identified three schools of Abhidhamma texts that trace back to a common ancestor.
* The Dharmaskandha fragments suggest a different sequence of topics compared to the Chinese version, possibly due to manuscript reshuffling.

## 3.4 The Three Strata Compared

* Despite being established independently, the three strata (Discourses, Collections, and Abhidhamma) share striking similarities in their core teachings.
* These shared topics include truths, aggregates, sense media, elements, feelings, origin, defilements, dependent origination, cessation, 8-fold path, satipaṭṭhāna, right efforts, bases of psychic power, spiritual faculties, and training.
* The congruence in content doesn't necessarily imply identical interpretations across schools, as each developed its own understanding over time.

## 3.5 The Saṁyutta-Mātikā In The Mahāyāna

* The saṁyutta-mātikā is fundamental to the structure of the Heart Sūtra and thus to the Prajñāpāramitā and Mahāyāna in general.

* The Heart Sūtra critiques an interpretation of the topics of the saṁyutta-mātikā in terms of the Abhidhamma theory of 'intrinsic essence', replacing that with dependent origination.
* The Saṁdhinirmocana Sūtra offers a more explicit account of what the issues are about, arguing that conceptual understanding is born of imagination and thought-constructs and takes these to be reality, but only with the non-conceptual unification of samādhi is true wisdom born.

* The text lists various topics covered by the saṁyutta-mātikā: aggregates, sense media, dependent origination, nutriments, truths, elements, satipaṭṭhānas, right efforts, bases of psychic power, awakening-factors, and path factors.
* These teachings become so familiar that the text often abbreviates, simply mentioning, for example 'aggregates, sense media, all discussed above…'; or else 'the five aggregates, the six internal sense media, the six external sense media, and suchlike.'

* The correlation between the topics listed in the Saṁdhinirmocana Sūtra and those found in the Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta is virtually exact.
* This may well be the reason why Asaṅga chose to comment at length on thisrecension of the Saṁyukta Āgama, the foundation of the other Āgamas.

* The Yogacāra hermeneutic of the Saṁdhinirmocana proposes that the understanding of these teachings should be based on samādhi rather than intellect.

# Chapter 4 The Gist 3—The Aṅgas

* This chapter explores the relationship between backbone texts (Nikāyas/Āgamas) and other Buddhist discourses.
* It examines the *aṅga* classification system, an early method of organizing Buddhist teachings.

## 4.1 The Nine And The Twelve

*  The *aṅgas* are a system for classifying Buddhist teachings, predating the Nikāyas/Āgamas.
* A list of nine *aṅgas* is found in Pali texts and Mahāsaṅghika texts, suggesting it predates the first schism.
* The Sanskrit tradition adds three more *aṅgas*, resulting in a list of twelve.

## 4.2 Later Aṅgas

* Some later *aṅgas* (gāthā, udāna, itivuttaka, jātaka) correspond to books in the Pali Khuddaka Nikāya.
* The *aṅga* classification likely refers to genres of text rather than specific collections.

## 4.3 Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, and Jātaka

* *Gāthā*: Refers primarily to early verses found in the Thera/Therīgāthā and Sutta Nipāta.
* *Udāna*: Originally referred to verses, later embedded in background stories that evolved into the Dhammapāda commentary.
* *Itivuttaka*: May refer to legendary histories or sayings of the past found in the Nikāyas/Āgamas.
* *Jātaka*: Might originally have referred to stories of the Buddha's past lives, but likely refers to the Jātaka book in its later form.

## Jātaka Literature

* The verses and 'stories of the past' in Jātaka literature are largely a product of folk storytelling tradition.
* Originally, these stories were likely used as moral fables before being associated with the Buddha in past lives.
* The 'stories of the present', added later, connect the characters to the Buddha and his family in past lives.

## Evolution of the Bodhisatta Doctrine

* The term 'bodhisatta' initially referred to Siddhattha during his period of striving before awakening.
* This suggests an early meaning of 'one intent on awakening' (*bodhiśakta*) rather than 'awakening-being' (*bodhisattva*).
* References in both Chinese and Theravāda scriptures support this meaning.

## Vedalla

* The term *vedalla* is problematic and appears as titles for two discourses in the Majjhima Nikāya.
* It is only used in the Theravāda tradition, while the Sarvāstivāda equivalents are named after the protagonists.
* The word does not appear in the body of the texts, suggesting it was added later.

## Abbhūtadhamma

* This aṅga refers to discourses discussing the 'marvellous qualities' of either the Buddha or his disciples.
* Examples include the Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta and the Bakkula Sutta.
* These discourses often feature Venerable Ānanda and are found together in both Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda canons.

## Sanskrit-Only Aṅgas

* *Upadeśa*: Meaning 'instructions, directions', it appears mainly in later texts and refers to treatises explaining the sūtras.
* *Apadāna*: Similar to *jātaka*, it usually refers to biographical stories of past lives, often disciples.
* *Nidāna*: Refers to background or source material, potentially connecting to Jātaka Nidāna or origin stories for Vinaya rules.

## Ambiguity of Classification

* The classification of aṅgas is not always clear-cut, with some texts like the Mahāpadāna Sutta blurring the lines between Suttas and Vinaya.
* This ambiguity reflects the way Vinayas blend hagiographic and prosaic elements.

# 4.2 Sutta, Geyya, Vyākaraṇa

* The text argues that the first three aṅgas (sutta, geyya, vyākaraṇa) were likely the earliest and most established parts of the Buddhist canon.
* This is supported by several pieces of evidence:
    * The Mahā Suññatā Sutta lists only these three aṅgas.
    * The Sanskrit Mahā Parinirvāṇa Sūtra and Asaṅga's Yogacārabhūmiśāstra also highlight the distinction between these first three and the later nine.

*  The text suggests that the first three aṅgas might have formed the core of the teachings delivered by the Buddha after his enlightenment, as described in the Peṭakopadesa.
* The meaning of these terms is still debated:
    * *Sutta*: likely refers to discourses or sermons.
    * *Geyya*: possibly refers to verses or songs.
    * *Vyākaraṇa*: could mean explanations or expositions of the suttas and geyyas.

* The sequence of the first three aṅgas is consistently maintained across different Buddhist traditions, while the later aṅgas show more variation in content and order.
* This further supports the idea that the first three were established earlier than the others.




# 3.2 The Three Aṅgas: Sutta, Geyya, and Vyākaraṇa

* *Sutta*: Means 'thread' and refers to basic doctrinal statements.
* *Geyya*: Less difficult to interpret, consistently regarded as mixed prose and verse.
* *Vyākaraṇa*: Means 'answer', chiefly used in the sense of an explanatory answer to a doctrinal question.

# 4.3 The Three Aṅgas And The First Discourses

* The first discourses fall into three divisions: the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, the second and third sermons, and the Request of Brahmā.
* These divisions correspond closely with the root meanings of the three aṅgas.
* The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is the paradigm for the *sutta* classification.
* The Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta and Ādittapariyāya Sutta are paradigms for the *vyākaraṇa* aṅga.
* The Request of Brahmā is the paradigm for the *geyya* aṅga.

| Sutta      | Vyākaraṇa         | Geyya               | 
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Content    | Basic doctrinal   | Detailed exposition | Inspirational/devotional                              |
| statements |                   |                     |                                                       |
| Style      | Declarative prose | Interrogative prose | Mixed prose and verse                                 |
| Speaker    | The Buddha only   | The Buddha and/or   | The Buddha, disciples, and                            |
| disciples  | others            |                     |                                                       |
| Context    | Always monastic   | Usually monastic    | Usually with lay people or deities, often Brahmanical |
| Paradigm   | Dhammacakkappavattana                   | Anattalakkhaṇa      | Request of Brahmā                                     |





## 4.4 The Aṅgas And The Vedas

* The threefold structure of Buddhist scriptures (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, Geyya/Vyākaraṇa) parallels the three Vedas (Ṛg Veda, Sāman and Yajur Vedas).
* Both systems show a multiplication pattern in threes (3, 9, 12).
* The idea of Tripitaka (Three Baskets) is significant in Buddhism despite variations in its structure.

## Chapter 5 Aṅgas In The Nikāyas & Āgamas

* Yin Shun claims the Saṁyukta Āgama consists of three aṅgas: sutta, geyya, and vyākaraṇa based on Yogacārabhūmiśāstra.
* Yin Shun identifies Sagāthāvagga as geyya, but his interpretation of sutta and vyākaraṇa differs from traditional understanding.
* The Yogacārabhūmiśāstra's interpretation doesn't align with the root meanings of sutta and vyākaraṇa.

* Asaṅga's opinion in Abhidharmasamuccaya contradicts his statements in Yogacārabhūmiśāstra regarding vyākaraṇa.
* Some minor saṁyuttas (Rādha-, Diṭṭhi-, Anuruddha-) fit Yin Shun's definition of vyākaraṇa and also align with traditional understanding.

* Yin Shun's classification doesn't fully account for discourses related to the four noble truths, which are scattered across different aṅgas.
* The evolution of suttas and vyākaraṇas involved an expansion of explanatory texts (vibhaṅgas) due to the limited size of suttas.
* Two possible developments emerged: accumulating individual vyākaraṇas or creating a comprehensive Vibhaṅga as a key to all discourses.

* The proto-Saṁyutta might have been compiled first, with Nikāyas/Āgamas and early Abhidhamma work developing concurrently.
* Early Abhidhamma likely consisted of wisdom teachings (truths, aggregates) and samādhi teachings (37 wings to awakening).
* Mahā Kaccāyana's discourses exemplify early Abhidhamma, focusing on analytical explanations of Buddhist concepts.

* The Vibhaṅga Mūla might preserve archaic features compared to existing Majjhimas due to its potential derivation from the same source as the proto-Saṁyutta.
* Discourses outside the Saṁyutta originated from various sources: moved from the proto-Saṁyutta, circulating in the community, originating in remote areas, combining pre-existing sections, evolving from narrative material, or being pure invention.

## 5.1 Saṁyutta

* The major doctrinal saṁyuttas were based on *suttas*, supplemented by *vyākaraṇa* explanations. This structure can be discerned in existing Saṁyuttas.

* This structure is more evident in the Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta Āgama than in the Pali.

* The Sacca-saṁyutta of both traditions reflects this pattern, with *suttas* tending to cluster together and *vyākaraṇas* doing the same.
*  The Sarvāstivāda collection starts with an uninterrupted run of 23 *suttas*, followed by a few miscellaneous texts, then 11 *vyākaraṇas*.

* The settings of the discourses in the Sacca-saṁyutta offer further confirmation of this structure.

* Both collections have a large number of equivalent texts, but also display anomalies such as single texts becoming two or more in another collection, variations between texts, and *suttas* becoming *vyākaraṇas*.
* Despite these anomalies, the grouping of texts as either *suttas* or *vyākaraṇas* is a significant structural principle underlying the formation of the collections.

* Several identifiable groups of texts are found in both collections, suggesting that not only content but also sequence was shared between traditions.

# 5.2 Majjhima
* Several chapters in the Sarvāstivāda Majjhima are called 'saṁyuttas' and have titles similar to sections in the existing Sarvāstivāda Saṁyutta.
* Chapters 6–10 of the Theravāda Majjhima have titles similar to or identical with titles in the Saṁyutta.
* The final chapter of the Theravāda Majjhima, the Saḷāyatanavagga, shares its title and subject matter with the Saṁyutta.
* The division into three groups of fifty discourses in the Theravāda Majjhima reflects the three aṅgas.

* The Vibhaṅgavagga is the only chapter that shares both the title and almost all the same content in the two Majjhimas. 
* Several of the discourses in the Vibhaṅgavagga are shared in common with chapters in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga.

* A framework comprising around a third of the discourses in the Majjhimas and Dīghas, which is not found, or at least is not prominent, in the existing Theravāda Saṁyutta Nikāya, is the 'training' (*sikkhā*).
* The Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta Āgama has a Sikkhā-saṁyutta containing the basic discourses on the threefold training. 




## 5.3 Dīgha

* There are three Dīghas available for inquiry: Theravāda, Dharmaguptaka, and Sarvāstivāda.

* The Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha was recently discovered in Afghanistan.

* The structure of the Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha has been reconstructed based on *uddānas* (summaries of discourse titles) and folio numbers.

* There are some differences between the Dīrgha as inferable from Śamathadeva's Abhidharmakośopāyikanāmaṭīkā and the actual manuscript.
 
## The Structure of the Sarvāstivāda Dīgha

* The Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha contains a 'Six-Sūtra Group' which is a popular set of discourses.

* This group includes: Daśottara, Arthavistara, Saṅgīti, Catuṣpariṣat, Mahāvadana, and Mahāparinirvāṇa.

* The next section, the 'Paired Group', contains two vaggas with much unshared material.

* Two pairs of discourses are quite similar in style and found together in all three collections: Janavasabha & Mahā Govinda; and Sampasādanīya & Pāsādika.

## Shared Discourses between Collections

* Several discourses in the Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha are also found in the Theravāda Majjhima, but not in the existing Madhyama Āgama in Chinese.

* This suggests that the compilers of the Madhyama and Dīrgha edited them conjointly to avoid duplicating discourses.

* Both the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda had versions of these discourses, but the Theravāda put them in its Majjhima, while the Sarvāstivāda included them in its Dīrgha.


## Discourses Moved Between Collections

* Ten discourses are found in the Theravāda Dīgha but in the Sarvāstivāda Madhyama.

* These were likely moved as a group from the Majjhima to the Dīrgha.

* Two of these discourses, Satipaṭṭhāna and Lakkhaṇa, have extra material in the Dīgha versions, suggesting they were padded out after being moved.

# The Śīlaskandhanipāta

* Several discourses found in the Sanskrit Śīlaskandhanipāta have no known Pali cognate.
* Some unshared discourses seem anomalous, such as the Jīvaka Sutta.
* The inclusion of Aṅguttara-style material is startling.
* Redactors may have used a 'principle of diversity' to assemble texts.

# Comparison of Discourses

*  A table compares the discourses found in the Sarvāstivāda, Theravāda, and Dharmaguptaka versions of the Dīgha Nikāya.
* Most discourses are shared among all three collections.
* The few unshared discourses mostly repeat shared discourses.

# Structural Significance of the Śīlakkhandhavagga

* This section consistently groups together discourses dealing with monastic ethical training, justifying its title 'Chapter on the Aggregate of Ethics'.
* The position of this vagga differs between traditions: at the beginning in the Theravāda, and at the end in the Dharmaguptaka and Sarvāstivāda.
* The Theravāda placement is likely correct based on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.

# Possible Origins of the Dīgha Nikāya

* This vagga may have been a key structural element in the ancestral Theravāda school before it split.
* It is possible that the original Dīgha was just the Sīlakkhandhavagga.
* The Sīlakkhandhavagga may have existed first in a proto-Saṁyutta or a '*Sikkhā-saṁyutta'.

# Breakdown of the Three-Aṅga Classification

* The Mahāpadāna Sutta exemplifies the breakdown of the three-aṅga classification.
* It combines elements from different literary formats, including *vyākaraṇa*, *sutta*, *apadāna*, *abbhūtadhamma*, *geyya*, Vinaya material, and *udānas*.

## 5.4 Aṅguttara

* The Saṁyutta and the Aṅguttara are complementary collections of shorter discourses.
* While the Saṁyutta arranges discourses by topic, the Aṅguttara organizes them numerically.

* This organizing principle is also found in other Buddhist texts like the Vinaya and Abhidhamma.
* Pre-Buddhist Vedic literature used a similar "saṁyutta" principle of grouping verses by topic.

* Some Jain texts use the "aṅguttara" principle, but it's unclear if this predates Buddhism.
* The Saṁyutta can be seen as a challenge to Vedic supremacy, systematically applying the same formal elements.
* Individual Buddhist discourses, the building blocks of collections, are internally organized by topic (saṁyutta principle).

* This suggests that the saṁyutta principle is logically prior to the aṅguttara principle.
* Some discourses use number as an internal organizing principle, but the thematic relationship remains dominant.

* Even in discourses organized numerically, each set of dhammas is still internally organized by topic (saṁyutta principle).
* The 37 wings to awakening illustrate the interplay between the two principles: a general saṁyutta structure with sets listed in ascending numerical order.

* Some schools misinterpreted this numerical sequence as implying an orderly progress of practice.
* Many Abhidhamma mātikās are constructed using the aṅguttara principle, suggesting its importance.

* However, there is no standard content for aṅguttara-principle texts, unlike saṁyutta-principle texts.
* The Aṅguttara's structure often involves splitting longer discourses into smaller units to fit numerical categories.

* This manipulation may have been driven by the need for more material in poorly represented numbers.
* Numbers held symbolic significance in Buddhism, and this likely influenced the organization of the Aṅguttara.

* For example, the number 'one' often denotes samādhi, and many early Aṅguttara discourses deal with samādhi.
* Within the larger disorder of the Aṅguttara, smaller groups of discourses are sometimes collected by topic (mini-saṁyuttas).




# Chapter 6 The Evolution Of The Truths

* This chapter examines how the four noble truths evolved in Buddhist texts.
* The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is used as a primary example.

## 6.1 Sanskrit Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta

* The Theravāda version presents the teachings in a specific order: two extremes, eightfold path, definitions of truths, three revolutions and twelve modes.
* Other versions omit some elements, such as the definitions of the truths.
* The Sarvāstivāda Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra offers an alternative narrative structure.

* This version presents the teachings in stages: first the two extremes and eightfold path, then the four noble truths with explanations, followed by the three revolutions and twelve modes.
* This suggests that the Theravāda combined teachings from different stages into a single discourse.

# 6.2 Spirals Of Elaboration

* The Sarvāstivāda version of the Discourse on Turning the Wheel of Dharma includes detailed explanations and expansions compared to the Theravāda account.
* This version emphasizes the three revolutions and twelve modes, which are incorporated into the definitions of the truths.
* The structure follows a *sutta/vyākaraṇa* model: initial declarative statement followed by question-and-answer elaboration.

* The Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta exemplifies this process, starting with the four noble truths and elaborating down to the physical properties.
* This demonstrates how all teachings can be classified within the framework of the four noble truths.

* The Saccavibhaṅga Sutta further illustrates this elaboration, with Venerable Sāriputta providing detailed explanations of each aspect of the truths.
* It highlights the progression from the Buddha's initial statement to disciple-led expansions.

* The Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta incorporates material from the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta and adds further expansions, particularly on the second and third noble truths.
* This suggests a continuous historical elaboration of doctrine.

* The Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga builds upon the Sutta exposition, adding more specific details and employing developed Abhidhamma concepts.
* It follows the *sutta/vyākaraṇa* pattern, with questions posed on the already elaborated text.

* The evolution of the four noble truths' analysis can be traced: Saccavibhaṅga Sutta → Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta → Vibhaṅga.
* Material from later stages sometimes found its way back into earlier texts, demonstrating a dynamic and interconnected development.

* This process aligns with the gist's prediction of simpler presentations preceding more complex ones.
* The basic statement is declarative, attributed to the Buddha, while elaborations are in question-and-answer form, attributed to disciples.

# Chapter 7 What Happened In The Sattapaṇṇi Cave?

* This chapter explores the historical context surrounding the First Buddhist Council.
* It analyzes passages from various Buddhist texts, including the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta and the Samantapāsādika, to understand how early Buddhists preserved and organized the Buddha's teachings.
* The author suggests that the Buddha encouraged his followers to recite core teachings after his death, leading to the compilation of the Saṁyutta Nikāya.

#  The 37 Wings to Awakening and the Twelve Aṅgas

* This section discusses the relationship between the 37 wings to awakening and the twelve aṅgas, two important categories of Buddhist teachings.
* The author argues that these seemingly different concepts were closely related in early Buddhism.
* He suggests that the wings to awakening might have served as a table of contents for the proto-Saṁyutta, while the aṅgas represented broader literary styles or genres within this collection.

# The Great References and the Authority of the Suttas

* This part examines the concept of "great references" in Buddhism, which emphasizes the importance of comparing any statement about the Buddha's teachings with the Suttas (discourses) and Vinaya (monastic rules).
* The author argues that this principle reflects the early Sangha's commitment to preserving and upholding the authenticity of the Buddha's words.

#  The First Council and the Rise of the Tipiṭaka

* This section explores the historical significance of the First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death.
* The author suggests that this council marked a pivotal moment in the development of Buddhist scripture, leading to the emergence of the Tipiṭaka (three baskets) as the authoritative collection of teachings.
* He cites evidence from the Samantapāsādika, a Theravada Vinaya commentary, which indicates that the Tipiṭaka gradually replaced earlier systems of organizing Buddhist texts.

#  The Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra and the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta: A Complementary Pair

* This part analyzes the relationship between two important Buddhist discourses, the Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra and the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta.
* The author argues that these texts form a complementary pair, framing the Buddha's career from its beginning to its end.
* He suggests that they may have served as narrative settings for the broader Dhamma-Vinaya tradition.

# The Catuṣpariṣat as a Narrative Framework

* It provides a narrative background for essential early teachings found in the Saṁyutta.
* It sows the seeds for the three aṅgas (proto-Saṁyutta).
* It forms the foundation for the entire edifice of the Dhamma.
* The *geyya* verses, starting with the Request of Brahmā, are distinctive and tend to occur in groups.
* The centrality of the *sutta* teachings of the Buddha himself is emphasized.

# The Ordination of Aññā Koṇḍañña

* It marks the starting-point for the Vinaya.
* This narrative merges into the formal description of ordination procedure, leading to the Khandhakas.
* The Khandhakas primarily deal with prescriptive aspects of monastic life.
* The Bhikkhu and Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga deals with proscriptive aspects, focusing on misconduct.

# Sudinna's Story

* It forms a negative counter-narrative to the Catuṣpariṣat material.
* While deities rejoice at the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta in the Catuṣpariṣat, they lament the corruption entered by Sudinna.
* This story highlights the contrasting themes of purity and defilement within the Sangha.

# The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta

* Attempts to pull together the diverse strands of the scriptures.
* Contains Vinaya-style material, summarizing key principles.
* Reviews and emphasizes key Dhamma teachings, notably the 37 wings to awakening, the four noble truths, and the threefold training.

# Contrasting Sections

* Mythic settings are consciously articulated to contrast with each other.
* The Request of Brahmā for the Buddha to teach contrasts with the Request of Māra for the Buddha to pass away.

# The Sanskrit Texts

* Suggest a close relationship between the Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra and the Mahā Parinirvāṇa Suttas.
* They were likely edited conjointly, possibly belonging to the Sarvāstivāda school.

# Extra Connections in Sanskrit

* Before the Request of Māra, the Buddha receives alms from Tapussa and Bhallika, his first meal after enlightenment.
* This detail connects to the Buddha's illness after his last meal, emphasizing the significance of these two meals.

# Interwoven Conception of Dhamma

* The Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra provides a framework for the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta and other central teachings.
* The Mahā Parinibbāna Suttas provide a framework for relying on the Dhamma & Vinaya after the Buddha's passing.


# Conclusion

* The continuity between the three strata of texts reflects an effort to stabilize the Buddha's teachings.
* Textual stability ensures the survival and transmission of ideas through time.
* The task is to peel back the layers of text to uncover the common Dhamma underlying all Buddhist schools.

# Chapter 8 Introduction To Mindfulness

* Mindfulness is essential for ethical conduct, memory, guarding the senses, and grounding actions in the present moment.
* It plays a crucial role in all types of meditation, including higher consciousness states (samādhi).
* Mindfulness extends awareness from ordinary consciousness to samādhi, aiding in understanding impermanence and causality.

#  The Ubiquity Of Mindfulness And The Vipassanāvāda

* Despite mindfulness's omnipresence, some Theravāda schools associate it closely with vipassanā (insight), particularly through the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* This association is supported by the widespread reverence for the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta in modern Theravāda circles.

# A Critique Of The Vipassanāvāda

* The author argues that the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, as we know it, is a late compilation and not representative of the Buddha's original teachings.
* They suggest that early Buddhism primarily associated satipaṭṭhāna with samatha (tranquility) rather than vipassanā.

# The Historical Context Of The Vipassanāvāda


* The vipassanāvāda arose within the "modernist Buddhism" movement, which sought to reconcile Buddhism with modernity and rationalism.
* Some modernist schools rejected meditation altogether, while others developed rational contemplative systems emphasizing vipassanā.

# A Call For Re-examination

* The author acknowledges the weight of authority supporting the vipassanāvāda but calls for a critical re-examination of its scriptural basis.
* They aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of early Buddhist texts on satipaṭṭhāna, openly acknowledging their own perspective and agenda.

## 8.1 Samatha & Vipassanā

* Samatha and vipassanā are two key aspects of meditation discussed in the Suttas.
* Samatha refers to steadying, settling, and unifying the mind, often achieved through the four jhānas.
* Vipassanā involves seeing, exploring, and discerning the nature of conditioned reality, particularly its impermanence, suffering, and not-self.
* Both samatha and vipassanā are essential for progress on the path.
* Samatha alleviates emotional defilements (lust), while vipassanā eliminates intellectual defilements (ignorance).

## Chapter 9 Previous Studies

* Many scholars have studied the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, providing valuable insights.
* Oskar von Hinüber suggested that some Suttas may contain smaller parts from which larger units were built.
* Venerable Anālayo's work, "Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization," offers a comprehensive study of satipaṭṭhāna from a vipassanā perspective.
* Anālayo acknowledges different versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta but primarily focuses on the Theravāda version.
* He also observes that certain meditation exercises, particularly investigating body parts, are common to all traditions, suggesting a possible common root text. 




## 9.3 Thích Nhất Hạnh

* Thích Nhất Hạnh has translated all three major versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* He believes the jhānas were a later addition to Buddhism, but offers no evidence for this claim.
* His analysis misses key points by assuming the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra is the original source.

## 9.4 Ṭhānissaro

* Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu translates 'dhammas' in satipaṭṭhāna as 'mental qualities'.
* He cites the Vibhaṅga and Sarvāstivāda version to support this view.
* He remains cautious about reconstructing an original text.

## 9.5 Thích Minh Châu

* Thích Minh Châu highlights differences between the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda versions of satipaṭṭhāna.
* He downplays the significance of these differences, suggesting they are due to free selection by compilers.
* However, he acknowledges that the differences reflect emerging doctrinal stances of the two schools.

## 9.6 Gethin

* R. M. L. Gethin notes divergences between versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* He criticizes Schmithausen and Bronkhorst for speculative reconstructions of the original text.
* He corrects Schmithausen's misunderstanding of ānāpānasati as a preliminary to satipaṭṭhāna.

## 9.7 Schmithausen

* Schmithausen analyzes three versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, excluding Abhidhamma texts.
* He observes similarities in sections dealing with feelings and mind across versions.
* He assumes original version had similar structure throughout based on phrasing.
* Some sections deviate from this pattern, particularly body contemplation exercises which use similes.

##  Schmithausen's Analysis of Body Contemplation

* Schmithausen considers similes in body contemplation unlikely to be authentic.
* However, the presence of similes doesn't necessarily indicate later additions.
* Similes could be appropriate for visualizations involved in these meditations.
* Sections on body parts and elements correlate with the satipaṭṭhāna formula despite not being formally identical.

## Schmithausen's Conclusions

* Schmithausen concludes that the original text consisted of passages congruent with contemplations of feelings and mind.
* He believes the "vipassanā refrain" was not original.
* He rejects the section on body parts despite its presence in all versions, prioritizing formal analysis over textual consistency.


## Critique of Schmithausen's Formal Analysis

* Schmithausen's reliance on stylistic consistency is deemed insufficient for drawing solid conclusions.
* The Abhidhamma texts exhibit a more consistent style than Suttas, suggesting congruent sections could be later additions.

## Schmithausen's Interpretation of Satipaṭṭhāna

* Schmithausen interprets satipaṭṭhāna as essentially choiceless awareness based on textual agreement and the opening paragraph of the Sutta.
* This interpretation is challenged by several arguments:
    * The existence of four satipaṭṭhānas implies choice and direction in meditation.
    * Body contemplation exercises involve directed meditation, reflecting a progression from controlled to undirected awareness.

##  Alternative Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna

* Several Suttas suggest the use of choice and judgment within satipaṭṭhāna.
* A discourse in the Saṁyutta describes both "directed" and "undirected" modes of satipaṭṭhāna.
* The term *anupassanā* does not necessarily imply choiceless awareness, as evidenced by its use in phrases like *asubhānupassī*.

## Schmithausen's Contribution

* Despite disagreements with some arguments, Schmithausen is credited for highlighting textual variations and prompting further investigation.
* Scholars agree on the historical development of the texts, the lack of an inherently authentic tradition, and the significance of variations in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.

## 9.8 Bronkhorst

* Bronkhorst's conclusions on satipaṭṭhāna are significant and build upon existing scholarship.
* He argues that the Pali Vibhaṅga, a Theravāda Abhidhamma text, may preserve older elements of the satipaṭṭhānas than those found in later Sūtras.
* Bronkhorst suggests that "observation of the positions of the body" might not have been the first satipaṭṭhāna originally.

## Chapter 10 Meditation Before The Buddha

* Buddhist texts assume meditation was a common practice before the Buddha's time.
* Despite this assumption, pre-Buddhist sources offer limited information about meditation practices.




## 10.1 Early Brahmanical Sources

* The earliest evidence for meditative culture comes from the Indus valley civilization, which was a vast and sophisticated society that flourished between 2500–3000 BCE.
* Seals depicting yogis in meditation postures suggest a connection to proto-Shiva and early forms of psychic practices.
* The word "sati" (memory) in Brahmanical tradition evolved from its original meaning of remembrance to encompass memorized texts, indicating a link between memorization and mental culture.

## Sati and Memory

* The concept of "sati" as memory likely developed alongside the practice of memorizing Vedic mantras, leading to an early form of mental discipline.
* A passage in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad highlights the connection between food, breath, speech, and mind, suggesting a holistic understanding of consciousness.

## From Mantras to Meditation

* The Buddha explained that remembering mantras depended on the absence of hindrances, demonstrating the early recognition of mental states affecting concentration.
* The word "mantra," originally referring to Vedic texts, is still used today as a term for meditation words, highlighting the enduring connection between recollection and meditation.

## Upasana: A Precursor to Satipaṭṭhāna

* The term "upāsana" (worship/meditation) appears frequently in early Upaniṣads like the Bṛhadāraṇyaka and Chāndogya, suggesting a shift towards inner contemplation.
* "Upāsana" encompasses a wide range of meditative practices involving various objects, both concrete and abstract.
* Edward Crangle suggests a connection between "upāsana" and the Buddhist term "satipaṭṭhāna," based on linguistic similarities and shared characteristics.

## Dating Early Meditation Practices

* The Vedas offer little information on meditation, while early Upaniṣads lack clear descriptions.
* Later Upaniṣadic texts and Jain scriptures provide more detailed accounts of meditative practices but are chronologically later than the Suttas.
* Some scholars question the traditional view that early Upaniṣads predate Buddhism, citing a passage in the Tevijja Sutta that lists Brahmanical schools without mentioning them.

# Upaniṣadic Meditation

* The Upaniṣads, though possibly compiled later, contain ideas that were prominent during the Buddha's time.
* These ideas include metaphysical concepts like the self being infinite or identical with the world, which the Buddha critiqued.

# Early Upaniṣads

* The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad is a mixed bag of lyrical beauty, sophisticated philosophy, and banal or even brutal content.
* It emphasizes personal experience over book learning and includes passages suggestive of meditation.
* However, it also endorses sacrifice, materialism, and even black magic.

# Meditation in the Upaniṣads

* The Bṛhadāraṇyaka contains passages suggesting breath control as a meditative practice.
* The Chāndogya Upaniṣad compares the mind settling on breath to a bird returning to its tether.
* The Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad provides more explicit instructions on meditation, including visualization techniques and breath control.

# Similarities with Satipaṭṭhāna

* The Upaniṣads share similarities with Buddhist satipaṭṭhāna meditation in their focus on breath, body contemplation, and the importance of heedfulness.
* Both traditions use lists of physical and mental phenomena as guides for practice.
* Elements like fire, air, earth, and body parts are worshipped in both traditions.

# Evolution of Indian Religion

* The Upaniṣads reflect an evolution from physical rituals to self-torment, then to refined states of consciousness, culminating in the Buddhist critique of metaphysical absolutism.
* Satipaṭṭhāna can be seen as a distillation of these stages, focusing on empirical phenomena and eschewing metaphysics.




## 10.2 The Buddhist Sources

* The earliest sources on meditation are Buddhist texts, but they may not accurately represent non-Buddhist practices.
* Both Buddhist and non-Buddhist sources agree that there were two main types of pre-Buddhist meditation: the "Upaniṣadic" style practiced by samādhi practitioners and the self-tormenting practices of the Jains.

## The Bodhisatta's Apprenticeship

* This passage describes the Bodhisatta's experience with Upaniṣadic yogis before his enlightenment.
* It highlights three stages: learning texts, practicing faith, energy, mindfulness, samādhi, and wisdom, and achieving formless attainments.
* The Bodhisatta rejected formless attainments because they led to rebirth in the formless realm, not full liberation.

## Samādhi and Mindfulness

* Samādhi is emphasized in this account because it was highly valued by these systems, but mistaken as the final goal.
* The difference between Buddhist and non-Buddhist meditation lies in the understanding and interpretation of experiences.
* The Bodhisatta's childhood experience with jhāna shows that mindfulness without preconceptions leads to the path of enlightenment.

## Pārāyana Vagga

* This text provides insights into Brahmanic meditation practices, possibly influenced by Upaniṣadic traditions.
* It depicts a friendly dialogue between the Buddha and sixteen Brahman meditators who practice jhāna.
* The Buddha encourages them to continue their practices while emphasizing mindfulness.

## Bojjhaṅga-saṁyutta

* Three discourses in this collection describe non-Buddhist wanderers claiming to teach Buddhist-style meditation.
* They emphasize the importance of abandoning hindrances and developing awakening factors, including samādhi.
* The Buddha distinguishes his teaching by claiming a deeper understanding of samādhi practice.

## Brahmajāla Sutta

* This text presents 62 doctrinal views derived from or reinforced by misinterpretations of samādhi experiences.
* It includes both form jhāna and formless attainments practiced by various yogis, including Brahmans and samanas.
* Five terms describe the path to samādhi: ardency, striving, commitment, heedfulness, and right attention.

## 10.3 Later Brahmanical Sources

* This section compares later texts with Suttas to illuminate pre-Buddhist meditation practices.
* The Mahābhārata mentions the 'fourfold *jhānayoga*' but only describes the first jhāna in detail.
* It emphasizes the importance of concentration and seclusion in achieving jhāna.

## The Yoga Sūtra

* This section analyzes the Yoga Sūtra, an early presentation of a non-Buddhist path to liberation.
* While distinct from Buddhism, it shares similarities in meditation terminology and practices.
* The Yoga Sūtra defines *sati* (mindfulness) negatively as 'memorised textual traditions', contrasting with the Buddhist positive sense.

## Samādhi in the Yoga Sūtra

* The text describes two types of samādhi: *samprajñāta* and *asamprajñāta*.
* *Samprajñāta* samādhi is similar to the first Buddhist jhāna, while *asamprajñāta* resembles formless attainments.
* Both involve stages of practice that align with Buddhist teachings on the five spiritual faculties.

## Vipassanā in the Yoga Sūtra

* The second chapter of the Yoga Sūtra includes instructions on vipassanā (insight meditation).
* It identifies ignorance, ego-clinging, desire, aversion, and attachment as obstacles to liberation.

# Ignorance

* Ignorance is the root cause of all defilements.
* It misinterprets permanence as impermanence, purity as impurity, and pleasure as pain.
* It mistakes the diverse experiences for a unified self.

# The Eight-Factored Yoga

* This system, modeled after the Buddhist eightfold path, outlines practices for overcoming defilements.
* The first two factors, *yama* and *niyama*, focus on ethics and purity.
* Cultivating opposite thoughts to counter negative ones is emphasized.

# Internal Practices

* *Dhāraṇa* involves fixing the mind on a single point, similar to Buddhist mindfulness (*sati*).
* *Dhyāna* (jhāna) is a state of mental unification achieved through *dhāraṇa*.
* *Samādhi*, the final step, involves experiencing an object as empty of its own form.

# Origins and Evolution

* A pre-Buddhist meditative tradition influenced both Buddhism and Yoga.
* This tradition emphasized memorization (*sati*) and mindful awareness (*anupassanā*).
* Yogis focused on realizing a metaphysical Self through samādhi, particularly formless attainments.
* The Buddha adopted practical aspects of this tradition but rejected the metaphysical interpretation of samādhi experience.

## 10.4 The Jains

* The Bodhisatta practiced austerities similar to Jain practices before achieving enlightenment.
* He initially believed that pleasure could be gained through pain, a view shared by the Jains.
* After realizing this was wrong, he remembered experiencing jhana while relaxed and decided to pursue that path instead.
* Jainism emphasizes effort and mindfulness but doesn't prioritize samādhi attainment like Buddhism.

## 10.5 Conclusion

* Satipaṭṭhāna is a distinctively Buddhist practice with unique features not found in pre-Buddhist texts.
* Early Buddhists acknowledged the spiritual achievements of other traditions, attributing practices like jhānas and mindfulness to them.
* Different schools emphasized samatha or vipassanā based on their philosophical views:
    * Upaniṣadic tradition focused on blissful identification with Brahman through meditation.
    * Jainism emphasized contemplation of impermanence and enduring pain to free the soul from karma.
* Evidence suggests that both Brahmanical and Jain traditions included mindfulness practices.

# Chapter 11 Building Blocks

* The chapter will focus on mindfulness within the Buddhist context, starting with the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.

## 11.1 The Function Of Satipaṭṭhāna

* This section addresses the five ascetics, placing Buddha's message within existing spiritual context.
* It dismisses wrong practices of sensuality and self-mortification, expounding the right way - the noble eightfold path.
* The text suggests the audience was familiar with the remaining seven factors of the path.

## 7 Or Again, In The Context Of The Five Spiritual Faculties:

* Satipaṭṭhāna is primarily a support for samādhi (jhāna).

##  The Function of Satipaṭṭhāna as Support for Jhāna

* This section analyzes the structural relationship between truths and the path.
* It emphasizes that satipaṭṭhāna's prime role is to support samādhi, based on definitions from various Suttas.
* The text clarifies the function of mindfulness in the awakening-factors.


##  The Significance of "Satipaṭṭhāna"

* This section explores the meaning of *satipaṭṭhāna*, resolving it into *sati* and *upaṭṭhāna*.
* It highlights the significance of *upaṭṭhāna* in establishing mindfulness.
* The text analyzes the phrase *parimukhaṁ satiṁ upaṭṭhapeti* in the context of gradual training.

##  The Gradual Training and Satipaṭṭhāna

* This section presents a table correlating the gradual training with other key teaching frameworks.
* It emphasizes the middle factors (contentment to abandoning hindrances) as part of samādhi training.

# 4 Noble Truths
* Suffering exists.
* Suffering arises from attachment and craving.
* Suffering can cease.
* The path to the cessation of suffering is the Eightfold Path.

# 3-fold Training
* Right view: Understanding the Four Noble Truths.
* Gaining faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
* Right intention: Cultivating wholesome thoughts and aspirations.

# 10-fold Path
* Hearing the teaching of the Buddha.
* Going forth from worldly life to practice.
* Rules of discipline for ethical conduct.
* Purifying livelihood by engaging in honest work.
* Contentment with what one has.
* Sense restraint: Controlling the senses and avoiding harmful indulgences.
* Moderate eating: Avoiding overeating and under-eating.
* Wakefulness: Being alert and mindful.
* Knowledge & vision: Developing wisdom and insight.
* Divine ear: Hearing the teachings of the Buddha.

# Gradual Training
* Practices are interconnected and build upon each other.
* Clear comprehension is a preliminary stage of mindfulness.
* Satipaṭṭhāna meditation involves establishing mindfulness in daily life.
* The four jhānas lead to liberating insight.


# 11.2 Mindfulness Itself
* Mindfulness can refer to ordinary memory or recollection.
* Mindfulness can also be understood as a specific meditative practice (satipaṭṭhāna).
* The term "mindfulness" is not frequently used in vipassanā teachings.
* Mindfulness plays a significant role in samatha practices, such as jhana meditation and sense restraint.

## 11.3 The Fourfold Establishing Of Mindfulness

* This section describes satipaṭṭhāna as a fourfold practice.
* It is not a definition of mindfulness but a prescription for how to practice.
* The four basic objects of satipaṭṭhāna meditation are body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.
* Satipaṭṭhāna is unique in specifying the object of meditation within the path.

* This specificity makes it an essential part of the path.
* The four objects may oppose the four perversions (seeing beauty in ugliness, suffering as pleasure, impermanent as permanent, self in what is not-self).
* The four objects progress from coarse to subtle: body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.

## 11.4 How The Practice Is Described

* While all traditions agree on the four objects of satipaṭṭhāna, descriptions of the subjective aspect differ.
* This difference is mainly due to editing preferences rather than sectarian divergence.

### 11.4.1 Simple And Complex Formulas

* Sarvāstivāda texts offer a simple formula: "one develops 'the establishing of mindfulness of contemplating a body in the body…' etc."
* Later Pali texts include similar formulations.
* The Theravāda version is more complex, adding qualifying terms to the simple formula.
* These terms relate to the auxiliary formula: "ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness & aversion for the world".

### 11.4.2 Covetousness & Aversion

* The phrase "having removed covetousness and aversion for the world" connects satipaṭṭhāna with sense restraint.
* *Abhijjhā* refers to covetousness or desire, while *domanassa* refers to aversion or ill-will.
* These terms encompass various levels of intensity, from coarse forms abandoned through preliminary practices to subtle forms abandoned during jhāna.

## 11.4.3 Satipaṭṭhāna Compared With Loving-Kindness

* The satipaṭṭhāna auxiliary formula sounds more like samatha than vipassanā.
* A similar description of meditative state is not found in direct vipassanā contexts.
* Both satipaṭṭhāna and loving-kindness descriptions suggest a similar subjective process of meditation.
* Jhana, rather than being a pre-requisite, is part of the complete fulfilment of satipaṭṭhāna.
* Mindfulness is developed within the context of the path as a whole.

## 11.4.4 Variants On The Basic Formula

* Several variants of the standard satipaṭṭhāna formula exist.
* Some variants describe the result of the practice in general terms.
* Others describe the actual meditation itself and are more specific to satipaṭṭhāna.
* Many variants explicitly deal with samādhi.
* Later texts offer even more variations on the basic formula.

## 11.4.5 'A Body In The Body'

* The idiom "a body in the body" has been often commented on.
* Some believe it is merely idiomatic, while others see it as emphasizing the object of contemplation.
* A passage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta offers a unique set of phrases qualifying each of the four objects of satipaṭṭhāna in the context of breath meditation.
* The passage suggests that "breath" is considered a kind of "body," or physical phenomenon.
* The meditator selects this sphere within the entire field of physical experience as the focus of awareness.
* This interpretation aligns with the thesis that satipaṭṭhāna is first of all a samatha practice.

## 11.4.6 'Contemplation'

* *Anupassanā* is often translated as "contemplation" and is a crucial part of the satipaṭṭhāna formula.
* Early Buddhist texts use *anupassanā* to describe a one-sided, judgmental regard, focusing on only one aspect of a situation.
* Later texts, like the Īśa Upaniṣad, use *anupassanā* to refer to seeing two sides of things and resolving them into a deeper unity.
* The Dvāyatānupassanā Sutta presents pairs of contemplations that lead to one goal when fully realized.
* In some contexts, *anupassanā* is used in samatha practices, focusing on beauty or ugliness to eliminate sensual lust.

* It can also be found in vipassanā contexts, such as contemplating impermanence, suffering, and not-self.
* *Anupassanā* is a mode of contemplation that conforms to the relevant context and implies continuous observation.


## 11.4.7 Clear Comprehension

* *Sampajañña*, often translated as "clear comprehension," is another term found in satipaṭṭhāna formulas.
* While sometimes equated with vipassanā, it is more characteristically used in the context of daily life awareness and as a preparation for jhāna.
* In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, *sampajañña* is used to describe clear awareness through meditation.
* Jhānas can also be qualified by terms related to wisdom, indicating that the development of jhāna involves a dimension of wisdom.

## 11.5 Internal/External

* The text discusses the practice of satipaṭṭhāna internally, externally, and internally-externally.
* Different Buddhist traditions present variations in how they integrate internal/external contemplation into the satipaṭṭhāna formula.
* While mindfulness is often associated with inward focus, the texts emphasize the importance of external contemplation as well.

## Internal/External Contemplation

* The terms "internal" and "external" are used in both samatha (tranquility) and vipassanā (insight) practices.
* In samatha, internal contemplation refers to visualizing objects within oneself, while external contemplation involves perceiving those visualizations externally.
* In vipassanā, the five aggregates are viewed as both internal and external aspects of experience.

## Meaning of Internal/External

* "Internal" contemplation leads to samādhi (concentration) and psychic visions of others' bodies.
* Charnel ground meditations exemplify internal/external contemplation by comparing one's body to decaying corpses.
* The Vijaya Sutta emphasizes dispelling desire for the body through both internal and external perspectives.

## Elements and Time

* The Mahā Hatthipadopama Sutta details internal/external contemplation of the elements, showing that both are ultimately impermanent and not-self.
* The concept of "external" extends to time, encompassing past and future events like the destruction of the earth at the end of the universe.

## Correlation with Cosmic

* Sarvāstivāda texts connect internal/external contemplation with past and future lives, highlighting a correlation between personal experience and cosmic reality.
* This correlation reflects a common theme in Indian thought, exemplified by the Upaniṣadic concept of Ātman (individual soul) and Brahman (world-spirit).


## Psychic Powers

* The phrasing used to describe mind contemplation in satipaṭṭhāna mirrors that of psychic powers like telepathy.
* Venerable Anuruddha attributes his development of psychic powers to satipaṭṭhāna practice.

## 11.6 'The Path Of Convergence'

* The term *ekāyana magga* is difficult to interpret precisely due to multiple meanings of the word "eka" and unclear grammatical relationships.
* Commentators offer various interpretations, but these are often vague and subject to polemic uses.
* Chinese translations also reflect uncertainty about the meaning.
* Gethin suggests two possible meanings from non-Buddhist contexts: 'lonely' or 'solo' way, and a way that leads to one point of convergence.

## 11.7 Gethin's Discussion

* Gethin cautions against pinning down a single definition for *ekāyana*, as it carries spiritual/mystical connotations and has various meanings in Brahmanical scriptures.
* The Chāndogya Upaniṣad lists 'Ekāyana' as an ancient Brahmanical text dealing with social ethics or politics, suggesting the idea of social policy leading to a unified society.

## 11.8 Contextual Meaning

* A Majjhima Nikāya context suggests *ekāyana* means "leads to one place only."
* Translators like Bhikkhu Bodhi have used this as the basis for rendering it as "direct way" or "one-way path," but this doesn't fully capture the term.

## 11.9 Relevance of Brahmanical Contexts

* The wide spectrum of meaning in Brahmanical usage suggests that Pali *ekāyana* may not have the same meaning in different contexts.
* It is essential to examine Brahmanical references more closely to understand its meaning in satipaṭṭhāna.

## 11.10 Occurrences in Saṁyuttas

* Relevant texts are present in both complete and partial Saṁyuttas, all following *ekāyana* with a statement about purification of beings.
* Most versions place this statement after the Buddha's enlightenment, when he reflected on satipaṭṭhāna as *ekāyana magga*.

## 11.11 Chinese Versions

* Three versions in the Sagāthāvagga are very similar, differing mainly in the absence of the "without" passage and shorter verses.
* These feature a unique variation in the satipaṭṭhāna pericope, shifting to optative mood, perhaps because there were no monks yet.

## 11.12 Anuruddha-saṁyutta

* A similar passage appears in the Anuruddha-saṁyutta, with Venerable Anuruddha taking the Buddha's role and Venerable Mahā Moggallāna playing Brahmā's part.
* Instead of verses, Moggallāna asks about delighting in satipaṭṭhāna, and Anuruddha replies with the normal pericope plus an addition emphasizing stillness and oneness of mind.

## 11.13 SN 52.1

* This text shares none of the special features except for the setting, replacing the samādhi emphasis with vipassanā.

## 11.14 Unity in Presentation

* The *ekāyana* passage and "without" passage occur together in all Chinese versions, always suggesting psychic powers and samādhi.
* These passages also appear in the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna-saṁyukta, separated into two discourses.

## 11.15 Pali Text Placement

* The *ekāyana* passage appears at the beginning of the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta, likely a later insertion.
* Its setting is mistakenly copied from the following discourse, indicating editorial changes.

## 11.16 "Without" Passage

* This passage lacks a corresponding counterpart in the Theravāda, suggesting decay or alteration.

## 11.17 Conclusion

* The *ekāyana* passage primarily originates from a Brahmanical context, attested in all existing Saṁyutta versions.
* These versions feature Brahmā in a setting similar to the 'Request of Brahmā,' likely the root text of the *geyya* aṅga.


## 11.18 Brahmanical Connection

* The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, an important Upaniṣad, contains a passage relevant to understanding *ekāyana*.
* This dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Maitreyī discusses immortality and the importance of self-knowledge.

# The Self

* All things are dear for the sake of the Self.
* By seeing, hearing, considering, and cognizing the Self, all this is known.

# Brahman and Kṣatriya

* Brahman, Kṣatriya, worlds, gods, beings ignore one who knows them as different from the Self.
* All these are the Self.

# Similes for Understanding

* Just as sounds cannot be grasped directly but by grasping the lute or player, so too understanding is grasped through its source.
* Like a fire with damp fuel producing various smokes, the Vedas and other scriptures arise from this Self.

# Convergence of Experiences

* The ocean is the convergence of waters, skin of touches, nose of smells, tongue of tastes, eye of forms, ear of sounds, mind of thoughts, heart of realizations, hands of actions, genitals of pleasure, anus of excretion, feet of movements, and speech of Vedas.
* Just as salt dissolves in water and becomes inseparable, so too this great being is a sheer mass of cognition.

# After Death

* When departed, there is no more perception.

# Confusion and Clarification

* Yājñavalkya's statement about no perception after death confuses Maitreyī.
* He clarifies that where duality exists, there are separate perceptions, but when All becomes identical with Self, there is no separate perceiver or perceived.

# Historical Context

* Yājñavalkya lived shortly before the Buddha.
* His teachings were part of the religious context of the Buddha's time.

# Connections to Buddhist Suttas

* Many aspects of this dialogue have close connections with Buddhist Suttas, except for the metaphysical 'Self' doctrine.

# Similarities to Buddhist Teachings

* Yājñavalkya's aspiration to go forth resembles samana traditions like Buddhism.
* The futility of wealth in the face of death is a classic Buddhist sentiment.
* The statement that loved ones are dear for the sake of the Self is similar to a passage in the Sagāthāvagga.

# Shared Concepts and Imagery

* Lists of seen, heard, thought, and cognized appear similarly in Suttas.
* Similes of drum, conch, and lute used to illustrate how sound manifests from the coming together of parts are found in Suttas.
* The image of rivers flowing into the sea is present in both texts.
* The simile of salt representing a unified taste is similar to the Buddha's saying about the Dhamma-Vinaya having the taste of liberation.

# Convergence and Oneness

* The description of cognition as infinite occurs in standard formulas on formless attainments.
* The bewilderment at grasping the state of the realized sage after death also appears in Suttas.
* The term *ekāyana*, meaning 'convergence' or 'going to one', is central to both texts and signifies the unification of diverse phenomena into a single source.

# Philosophical Significance of Ekāyana

* In Brahmanical tradition, *ekāyana* refers to the convergence of the mind in samādhi.
* The term literally means 'going to one'.
* In Buddhist context, 'one' likely refers to samādhi or unification of mind.

# Satipaṭṭhāna and Ekāyana

* Satipaṭṭhāna is singled out as playing a key role in bringing the mind to samādhi.




## 11.7 'Achieving The Way'

* The phrase "achieving the way" (*ñāyassa adhigamāya*) in the context of Satipaṭṭhāna is best understood as referring to the overall path of practice, rather than specifically dependent origination.
* This meaning aligns with the common usage of *ñāya* in the context of the Sangha's practice and the noble eightfold path.
* The Sandaka Sutta illustrates this connection by associating *ñāya* with samādhi and jhāna practices leading to arahantship.

## 11.8 The Aṅguttara

* The Aṅguttara Nikāya contains limited material on satipaṭṭhāna, likely because it complements the Saṁyutta Nikāya which focuses more extensively on doctrines.
* Satipaṭṭhāna appears alongside other wings to awakening in repetitive series within the Aṅguttara.
* One passage mentions six things to be abandoned for successful satipaṭṭhāna practice: fondness of work, speaking, sleeping, and company; lack of sense restraint; and eating too much. This emphasizes preparation through gradual training.
* The only substantial discourse on satipaṭṭhāna in the Aṅguttara treats it purely as samatha meditation, possibly relocated from the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṁyutta.

## Chapter 12 The Saṁyutta

* The Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta is a rich collection with diverse elements like parables, metaphors, glimpses into monastic life, and inspiring stories for lay meditators.
* While several texts offer insights beyond the basic satipaṭṭhāna formula, there is no detailed analysis within this collection.
* This chapter will analyze the structure and content of the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta and examine related saṁyuttas that also feature satipaṭṭhāna. 




## 12.1 The Satipaṭṭhāna-Saṁyutta

* This section analyzes the structure and content of the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta, a collection of Buddhist discourses.
* It compares the Theravāda (SN 47) and Sarvāstivāda (SA) versions, noting differences in text classification and arrangement.

## 12.1.1 The Tales

* This subsection focuses on the "tales" found within the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta, highlighting their literary and psychological significance.
* These tales use humor and relatable situations to illustrate the benefits of satipaṭṭhāna (mindfulness) practice.

* **SN 47.8/SA 616 The Cook:** Compares a skilled cook who pleases his master with a skillful monk who attains samādhi through satipaṭṭhāna.
* **SN 47.6/SA 617 The Hawk:** Uses the analogy of a quail safe in its habitat but vulnerable outside to illustrate how satipaṭṭhāna protects against sensual distractions.

* **SN 47.19/SA 619 Sedaka:** A parable about two acrobats supporting each other, emphasizing the interconnectedness of self-protection and protecting others.
* **SN 47.7/SA 620 The Monkey:** Warns against getting caught in sensual pleasures (like a monkey trapped in tar) by staying within the safe haven of satipaṭṭhāna.

* **SN 47.20/SA 623: The Most Beautiful Girl in the Land:** Uses the metaphor of carefully carrying oil while being threatened with decapitation to illustrate the importance of mindfulness of the body. This tale is unique for including a *vyākaraṇa* (exposition) and differing between the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda versions in setting and inclusion of satipaṭṭhānas.

## 12.1.2 The Narratives

* This section discusses narratives related to the Buddha's awakening and passing away.
* Some texts recall these events directly, while others merely imply a narrative context.

##  Of those that recall the Buddha's awakening

* 'Brahmā' suttas recount the 'Request of Brahmā', a paradigmatic geyya passage.
* These suttas are found in different collections (Sagāthāvagga and Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta).
* The role of Brahmā differs between these accounts, reflecting evolving Buddhist views on gods.

## More material is found around the time of the Buddha's passing away

* The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta recounts a discourse at Ambapālī's mango grove shortly before the Buddha's death.
* SN 47.9 'Ill' poignantly depicts the Buddha's illness and his declaration that he does not have the 'closed fist of a teacher'.

## SN 47.11–14 form a mini biography of Venerable Sāriputta

* These texts discuss Sāriputta's understanding of enlightenment, his last meeting with the Buddha, and his passing away.
* They highlight the connection between satipaṭṭhāna and the path to enlightenment.

##  SN 47.13/ SA 638 relates how Venerable Sāriputta became ill and passed away

* The text includes details about his final journey and interactions with the Buddha and other disciples.
* It emphasizes the impermanence of life and the importance of relying on the Dhamma.

## SN 47.14/SA 639 follows immediately after SN 47.13

* This text depicts the Buddha's grief over Sāriputta's passing and his praise for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
* It reinforces the idea of the Buddha's teachings continuing through his disciples.


## There are some more texts that might also be set in the time following the Parinibbāna

* These discourses feature Venerable Ānanda and Venerable Bhadda at the Cock's Monastery in Pāṭaliputta.
* They may reflect discussions within the Sangha about the future of Buddhism after the Buddha's death.

## The relation between these short texts and the long narratives has been debated by scholars

* Some believe the long narratives emerged first, while others argue that both developed gradually over time.
* These narratives enrich our understanding of satipaṭṭhāna by contextualizing it within the broader framework of life and death.

## Another discourse also emphasizes satipaṭṭhāna in the context of death

* SN 47.30/SA 1038 Mānadinna depicts Venerable Ānanda encouraging a dying householder to practice satipaṭṭhāna.
* This text highlights the relevance of satipaṭṭhāna even in the face of death.





## 12.1.3 Clear Comprehension

* SN 47.35 presents a variation on 'mindfulness & clear comprehension'.
* The standard passage describes awareness of daily activities during gradual training leading to the four jhānas.
* Sarvāstivāda includes two discourses (SA 636, SA 637) on gradual training that have no Theravāda counterparts.

* These discourses describe a practitioner who hears the Dhamma, decides to go forth, rectifies conduct, protects speech, purifies livelihood, guards sense doors, practices clear comprehension, and establishes the mind in peaceful abiding.
* They abandon hindrances, practice four satipaṭṭhānas, and develop them.

* The practice of clear comprehension in daily activities is presented simply in a discourse found in both collections.
* This discourse exhorts monks to be 'mindful & clearly comprehending'.
* Mindfulness is defined as the four satipaṭṭhānas, and clear comprehension as awareness of activities.

* SN 47.35 has no SA counterpart and may be a secondary formation.
* In this discourse, mindfulness is the four satipaṭṭhānas, but clear comprehension involves remaining aware of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts.

* Elsewhere, this practice is the third of four kinds of 'development of samādhi'.
* These developments are progressive, starting with jhāna, indicating advanced practices.
* The first two are on the side of samatha: the four jhānas leading to pleasant abiding, and perception of light leading to psychic powers.

* The third leads to 'mindfulness & clear comprehension', while the fourth involves observing the origin and dissolution of aggregates, leading to defilement's ending.
* Both focus on impermanence (vipassanā).

* Contemplating feelings, perceptions, and thoughts' rise, persistence, and ending doesn't provide a complete field of insight because it excludes the body.
* This practice solely concerns present moment experience and hasn't deepened to understanding experience's underlying principle.

* It involves dhamme *ñāṇaṁ* (knowledge regarding phenomena), but not anvaye *ñāṇaṁ* (inferential knowledge).
* It 'clearly comprehends' the known, not the knowing itself, which is key to deep insight.

* This practice involves direct observation of phenomena, not inference of causal principles describing events unfolding over time.
* Cognition arises dependent on mental objects; it can never directly observe itself.

* Insight into cognition requires an inferential process involving time.
* Contemplation of mind objects is valuable but won't lead to liberation until deepening into a more full comprehension of the entire field of experience (past, present, future).


* Both meditative development of clear comprehension and awareness of bodily activities are distinguished from satipaṭṭhāna.

* They are related, not equated; in practice they may not be isolated, but the Saṁyutta doesn't subsume these practices within the four satipaṭṭhānas.
* The meditative practice has different objects than satipaṭṭhāna: only feelings directly correlate.

* One might equate perceptions and thoughts with dhammas, but descriptions of practices don't support this.
* A key satipaṭṭhāna exercise is ānāpānasati, which quells thoughts.

* Satipaṭṭhāna aims to eliminate thoughts for a still mind, not be mindfully aware of them as they pass.
* The meditative development of clear comprehension described here is of secondary importance.




## 12.1.4 The Vibhaṅga Sutta

*  The Vibhaṅga Sutta is not found in the Chinese canon, suggesting it may be a secondary development.
* Its position within the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta and lack of a Sarvāstivādin counterpart further support this theory.
* The title "Vibhaṅga" implies an analysis, but the content is more akin to a teaching (desanā).

*  The discourse presents a threefold teaching: satipaṭṭhāna itself, its development through contemplating origination and dissolution, and the path leading to its development (the noble eightfold path).
* This structure resembles the Iddhipāda-saṁyutta, which also has a "Teaching" followed by an "Analysis."

* The Vibhaṅga Sutta's use of "development" to refer to observing rise and fall differs from the typical understanding of development as "cultivation, development, and making much of" relevant dhammas.
* There are four different descriptions of "development" within the Pali Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta: cultivation and development of the basic practice; simply presenting the basic formula; contemplation internally and externally; and contemplating impermanence.

* The Vibhaṅga Sutta likely underwent revisions, possibly starting as a "Teaching" discourse focused on the traditional understanding of "development."
*  The section on rise and fall may have been added later, replacing the original focus on development through cultivation or internal/external contemplation.




## 12.1.5 The Samudaya Sutta

* The Sarvāstivāda version of the Samudaya Sutta is likely more original than the Pali version due to several factors.
* Both versions agree on the causes for the four objects of satipaṭṭhāna: body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.
* Sections b and c, which discuss contemplation of origination and dissolution, are absent in the Theravāda Samudaya Sutta but appear in other texts like the Vibhaṅga Sutta and Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.

* The Samudaya Sutta likely originated from the Khandhasaṁyutta, where similar teachings on vipassanā are prevalent.
* The text defines the origin of the body as food, feelings as contact, mind as name & form, and dhammas as attention.

* It uses "citta" instead of "viññāṇa" to refer to mind, suggesting a broader understanding encompassing both ordinary and meditative mind.
* The Samudaya Sutta treats satipaṭṭhāna objectively, referring to the objects of mindfulness rather than the act of establishing mindfulness.

* This objective sense leads to ambiguity and interpretive difficulties.
* Despite issues with authenticity and editing, the Samudaya Sutta offers valuable insights into early Buddhist thought on satipaṭṭhāna.




## 12.2 The Anuruddha-Saṁyutta

* This Saṁyutta focuses exclusively on satipaṭṭhāna, with all discourses spoken by Venerable Anuruddha.
* It presents a complex vipassanā analysis combining internal/external contemplation with impermanence contemplation.
*  This discourse introduces the framework of contemplating the repulsive in the unrepulsive and vice versa, then abiding in equanimity.
* Most of the remaining discourses emphasize the samādhi aspect of satipaṭṭhāna, attributing Anuruddha's psychic powers to it.

## 12.3 The Vedanā-Saṁyutta

* This Saṁyutta is oriented towards vipassanā, emphasizing understanding impermanence of feelings.
* Several discourses teach that one understands the cessation of feelings through jhānas.
* Two similar discourses for sick bhikkhus invoke satipaṭṭhāna, advocating clear comprehension and contemplation of feeling's conditionality and impermanence.
* These discourses present a sequence: four satipaṭṭhānas; clear comprehension of bodily activities; contemplation of feelings.

* The text describes vipassanā as investigation into causality, absent in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself.
* Feelings are considered intrinsic to satipaṭṭhāna, but the four satipaṭṭhānas are not mentioned in Saḷāyatana-saṁyutta or Khandha-saṁyutta.
* Unskilled thoughts cease through satipaṭṭhāna or signless concentration (first jhāna).
* The Saḷāyatana-saṁyutta connects mindfulness with sense media, emphasizing sense restraint and tranquility.

## 12.4 The Ānāpānasati-Saṁyutta

* Mindfulness of breathing was the Buddha's preferred meditation, holding a special place as the path to enlightenment.
* The Theravāda Majjhima Nikāya contains the Ānāpānasati Sutta, while the Sarvāstivāda Madhyama Āgama has it as an isolated text.
* The 16 steps of ānāpānasati are analyzed against the four satipaṭṭhānas in both Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda traditions.

## Chapter 13 Early Abhidhamma

* This chapter discusses Abhidhamma texts before Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas to highlight archaic features preserved in Abhidhamma and challenge modern vipassanāvāda interpretations.
* Abhidhamma literature is sectarian, systematizing the Dhamma from different schools' perspectives, unlike the pre-sectarian Suttas and Vinaya.
* Three Abhidhamma texts - Vibhaṅga (Theravāda), Dharmaskandha (Sarvāstivāda), and Śāriputrābhidharma (Dharmaguptaka) - share a common source called *Vibhaṅga Mūla*.
* This common source was a *mātikā*, a matrix of doctrinal categories with explanations from Suttas and word definitions, predating the schisms and overlapping with Sutta compilation. 




## 13.1 Vibhaṅga

* The Vibhaṅga discusses satipaṭṭhāna as one of the 37 wings to awakening.
* It includes a 'Sutta Exposition' and an 'Abhidhamma Exposition'. This summary focuses on the Sutta Exposition.
* The Vibhaṅga presents the basic satipaṭṭhāna formula with internal/external contemplation.

##  Body Contemplation

* The Vibhaṅga treats the body as 31 parts, a more primitive approach than the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* Elements and corpse meditations are also present.
* The enumeration of 31 body parts is early, but the brain was later added to make the classic 32 parts.

## Feeling Contemplation

* The Vibhaṅga introduces a distinction between 'carnal' and 'spiritual' feelings, explained in the Vedanā-saṁyutta.
* Rapture is included as a kind of feeling, suggesting the Vedanā-saṁyutta synthesizes feeling sections from satipaṭṭhāna and ānāpānasati.

## Mind Contemplation

* The Vibhaṅga focuses on understanding the mind with and without greed, anger, and delusion.
* This likely refers to abandoning these hindrances through samādhi, similar to the six recollections.
* The contemplation emphasizes experiencing the 'exalted' mind, the 'unexcelled' mind, etc., all terms for jhāna.

## Dhammas Contemplation

*  The Vibhaṅga includes only the five hindrances and seven awakening-factors.
* It lacks introductory and concluding sentences found in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* This section is primarily a samatha practice, focusing on investigating causality.

## Comparison of Mind and Dhammas Contemplation

* In mind contemplation, the direct object is the mind itself, with qualities like lust acting as adjectives.
* In dhammas contemplation, the direct object is the mental quality itself (e.g., sensual desire).
* Dhammas contemplation introduces an investigation into causality.

# 13.2 Dharmaskandha

* The Dharmaskandha closely resembles the Vibhaṅga, sharing many details and structure.
* It includes additional material not found in the Vibhaṅga, such as:
    * A setting at Sāvatthī, similar to the Suttas.
    * Attribution to Venerable Sāriputta.
    * The standard auxiliary formula for satipaṭṭhāna.
    * Mention of past, present, and future practice, reflecting the Sarvāstivādin perspective on time.

#  The Absence of Material in the Vibhaṅga


* Certain material from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is absent in the Vibhaṅga, including similes and the vipassanā refrain.
* This absence suggests that the compilers of the Vibhaṅga were working with a shorter source text rather than simply removing material.

# Similarities Between Vibhaṅga and Dharmaskandha

* Both texts share strong correlations in content and structure.
* The Dharmaskandha includes almost all the material from the Vibhaṅga.




# Table 13.3: The Structure Of The Dharmaskandha

* Defines internal body, feelings, mind and dhammas.
* Lists body parts, three feelings, mind with/without lust etc., sensual desire present, absent, arising, abandoning, future non-arising.
* Defines contemplates, abides, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, covetousness, aversion.
* Includes six elements, eye, visual forms, fetters present, absent, arising, abandoning, future non– arising.

# Comparison of Contemplation of Mind in Different Texts

* Compares the contemplation of mind as listed in the Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra, Śrāmaṇyaphala Sūtra, Dharmaskandha and Śrāvakabhūmi.
* Notes that the Śrāmaṇyaphala Sūtra is closer to the Dharmaskandha than the Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra.
* Suggests that extra terms in the Sarvāstivāda may have started as commentarial glosses.

# Vipassanā Refrain and Definitions

* Highlights the addition of a vipassanā refrain at the end of each section in the Dharmaskandha.
* Explains that this refrain is derived from passages in the Nikāyas but not found in early texts in the context of satipaṭṭhāna.
* Notes that the definitions of internal and external are different from the Theravāda and are sectarian.
* Explains that the definition of 'dhammas' as aggregates of perception and conceptual activities was adopted by the Theravāda commentaries and has become standard.



## 9

* A group originally part of the fourth noble truth (the path) is being equated with dhammas of the first noble truth (the five aggregates).

* This incongruity reflects the inappropriateness of equating 'phenomena' with 'principles'.

* The Abhidhamma period emphasized the meaning of 'dhammas' as phenomena at the expense of other meanings.

## 39

* The Dharmaskandha adds a word definition of the basic satipaṭṭhāna formula, listing synonyms in Abhidhamma style.
* This definition is repeated after each section throughout the text—except the basic formula, which is incongruous.

## 40-41

* Compared with the Sutta Exposition of the Vibhaṅga, the Dharmaskandha:
    * Has all additions and no subtractions.
    * Often contains incongruities (setting, six elements, sense media, dhammas as perception/conceptual activities, definitions).
    * Sometimes hints at sectarianism (past, present, future; influence of Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra).

## 42-43

* These considerations suggest that the Dharmaskandha is later than the Vibhaṅga.
* Both texts share a pre-sectarian text, the *Vibhaṅga Mūla*.
* The Sarvāstivādins expanded this for the Dharmaskandha, while the Theravādins wrote a new Abhidhamma Exposition.
* The chief difference between the two is that the Vibhaṅga lacks vipassanā material found in the Dharmaskandha.

## 44-45

* This text represents the whole field of abhidhamma in the Dharmaguptaka system.
* It contains material comparable to Theravāda texts like the Dhātukathā, Paṭṭhāna, Puggala Paññatti, and Dhammasaṅgaṇī, as well as the Vibhaṅga.

* The text's eccentric structure becomes clearer when recognizing that the main paradigm is exemplified in the contemplations of feelings, mind, and dhammas; body is divergent.
* The first question, 'what is contemplating the feelings [etc.]' is answered by defining feelings [etc.], which doesn't really answer the original question.

## 46-48

* The definition of the body is standard.
* The definition of feelings is also standard, although the Suttas do not treat feelings in satipaṭṭhāna as based on the six senses; this shift is also found in the Theravāda commentaries.

* The definition of mind is similar to the treatment of contemplation of mind in ānāpānasati in the Paṭisambhidāmagga.
* The definition of dhammas is also late and similar in meaning to the Dharmaskandha, but the phrasing is identical to the Paṭisambhidāmagga.

## 49-51

* Internal contemplation is described in terms similar to the vipassanā refrain from the Khandha-saṁyutta, just as the Dharmaskandha.
* It is unclear whether the Śāriputrābhidharma copied from the Dharmaskandha or they both borrowed from the Khandha-saṁyutta.

* The vipassanā refrain is expanded by adding factors from dependent origination, appropriately adjusted in each case.

* Strangely, the authentic satipaṭṭhāna material is presented after the additions.
* This second half of each section, featuring the meditation objects and the refrain, is very similar to the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.




# Chapter 14 The Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas
* There are three complete versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: one in Pali and two in Chinese.
* There is also a fourth, incomplete, version in the large Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra.

# 52 The Long List of Body Contemplations
* The long list of body contemplations falls into three divisions.
* The first two exercises are very similar, basically 'awareness of movements'.
* The four postures passage is probably more original in this context.
* Perhaps this simpler, vaguer passage was felt in need of concrete illustration, so the section on clear comprehension was brought in from the gradual training.

# 53 The Division of Ānāpānasati
* The next division is ānāpānasati.
* In all versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the normal sixteen steps have been abbreviated to four.
* The full sixteen-step version is the more fundamental one.

# 54 Venerable Ariṭṭha's Practice
* The idea that the full development of ānāpānasati must involve all sixteen steps is borne out in a Sutta where Venerable Ariṭṭha describes his practice of ānāpānasati.
* While acknowledging that this was indeed ānāpānasati, the Buddha encouraged Venerable Ariṭṭha to fully develop ānāpānasati through the whole sixteen steps.

# 55 The Third Division: Diverse Contemplative Exercises
* The third division consists of diverse contemplative exercises, starting with the parts of the body.
* Since the parts of the body is the only exercise mentioned in all versions, and since it virtually always comes at the start of this division, it has the greatest claim to authenticity.

# 56 These Diverse Exercises are Treated in Terms of Samatha and Vipassanā
* The central purpose of contemplation of the body parts is to abandon lust, which is samatha.
* But the body parts, especially when subsumed under the elements, are also contemplated as 'not mine', etc., which is vipassanā.

# 57 Organization of Body Contemplation Sections in Different Versions
* In the body contemplation sectionsin the seven different versions of the satipaṭṭhāna material, three mention only this third division.
* Of these four long versions, the Śāriputrābhidharma and the Prajñāpāramitā are the best organized.

# 58 Clear Comprehension Was Not Originally Regarded as a Meditation
* There are good reasons for thinking that clear comprehension was not originally regarded as a meditation as such.
* Perhaps the reason for the Buddha's digression was that Rāhula's mind required preparation before it was mature enough to fully benefit from a subtle exercise like ānāpānasati.

# 59 The Meghiya Sutta Presents a Graduated Series of Dhammas
* The Meghiya Sutta is similar in that it presents a graduated series of dhammas for maturing the mind.
* Other variants occur, such as ugliness, ānāpānasati, and impermanence.

# 60 Why Were the Other Two Divisions Brought In?
* If, as the concordance of the texts suggests, the section on body parts, either alone or as the head of the third division, was the original body contemplation, why were the other two divisions brought in, and why were they placed before the original section?


# 61 The Relationship Between Dharmaguptaka Suttas and the Śāriputrābhidharma
* It is therefore possible that the details of the list of body contemplations in the Śāriputrābhidharma reflect the form of a now-lost Dharmaguptaka version of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* This is far from certain, as both the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda display considerable variation between the Sutta and early Abhidhamma descriptions of satipaṭṭhāna.





## 14.1 Prajñāpāramitā

* This text is one of the foundational texts of the Mahāyāna and is believed to have been compiled roughly 500 years after the Buddha's passing away.
* Different versions exist in Tibetan, Chinese, and a reconstructed Sanskrit version translated by Conze.
* The Prajñāpāramitā passages on satipaṭṭhāna likely hark back to a single original source, possibly from the Mahāsaṅghika tradition.

* Although later than the Āgama Suttas, the Prajñāpāramitā preserves early features of satipaṭṭhāna teachings.
* The compilers of the Abhidhamma and the Prajñāpāramitā had different agendas, leading to minimal alteration of early material in the latter.

* Satipaṭṭhāna is treated in two separate places in the Prajñāpāramitā, both as part of a larger context treating the way of practice of a Bodhisattva.
* The first passage defines the four satipaṭṭhānas and then provides a variation on the standard passage with familiar features like reflexive repetition and contemplation of internal/external body.

* This passage lists body contemplation practices identical to those in the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, including illustrative similes.
* While the phrasing is nearly identical, there are structural divergences, such as listing awareness of postures before ānāpānasati.

* The lack of a refrain and substitution of 'bodhisattva' for 'bhikkhu' are the only Mahāyānist elements.
* The asymmetry in the text suggests editing irregularities, with detailed expositions lost and basic formulas mechanically inserted.

* The second exposition defines satipaṭṭhāna as 'supramundane and not worldly' and then provides the basic passage without detailed exposition.
* This passage includes a vipassanā refrain similar to the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta but lacking certain phrases.

* Textual details diverge from the earlier passage, including the arrangement of textual elements and omission of 'Bodhisattva'.
* These differences suggest that the two passages are taken from different sources, reinforcing the idea that the detailed list of meditation practices and vipassanā refrain were originally independent textual entities.

## 14.2 Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra

* The Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra is a text preserved in the Chinese Tripiṭaka, translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in 389 ce.

* It shares similarities with the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta but also has significant differences, suggesting they stem from slightly divergent traditions.
* The Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra emphasizes the role of Tathāgatas in realizing enlightenment through satipaṭṭhānas, abandoning hindrances, and developing awakening-factors.

* It presents a simplified satipaṭṭhāna formula, likely due to its inclusion in a larger collection where the full formula was already established.
* The body contemplation exercises in the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra include some practices that are somewhat incongruous with the context of body contemplation.

##  Comparison with Theravāda Kāyagatāsati Sutta

* Both Suttas share a list of 14 body contemplation exercises, but the Sarvāstivāda version includes additional practices and similes.
* The refrain in the Sarvāstivāda Kāyagatāsati Sutta emphasizes the attainment of samādhi through diligent practice, while the Theravāda version focuses on vipassanā (insight).

## Similes and Imagery

* Both Suttas use distinctive imagery, such as the ocean, full pot, and full pond, to illustrate mindfulness of the body.
* The jhāna similes in both Suttas emphasize immersion in bliss and pervade the entire field of awareness.


##  Sectarian Differences

* The specific details of the lists of exercises in both Suttas are sectarian, suggesting that each school edited these discourses conjointly.
* The extra practices in the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra, such as controlling thoughts, are also found in other texts like the Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta.

# 37

* The perception of light is mentioned in the Iddhipāda-saṁyutta and Aṅguttara Nikāya.
* Its inclusion in satipaṭṭhāna may have been influenced by passages on abandoning sloth & torpor.
* There's no obvious reason why it should come under body contemplation.

# 38

* The 'basis of reviewing' is mentioned in the Aṅguttara and Dīghas as a factor of noble right samādhi.
* The mention of postures may have prompted its inclusion under body contemplation.
* The situation with jhāna similes is similar, with the body merging metaphorically with the physical body.

# 39

* The internal sequence of the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra is obscure.
* The perception of light and reviewing knowledge are influenced by the five-fold right samādhi.
* There are two variations of this: the Aṅguttara mentions four jhānas and 'basis of reviewing', while the Dīgha mentions five factors, including suffusion with rapture, bliss, heart, light, and basis of reviewing.

# 40

* The identification of structural influences on the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna and Kāyagatāsmṛti Sūtras allows for a better understanding of their structure.
* They start with contemplation of body postures and movements through daily activities, then control of thoughts (right intention).

* Next is ānāpānasati leading to the four jhānas, followed by perception of light associated with psychic powers.
* Finally, reviewing knowledge investigates the whole process, especially jhāna-consciousness.

# 41

* This section makes sense as a description of normal practice in the Suttas, but its inclusion as part of body contemplation is incongruous.
* Only some sections are body contemplation proper; the rest fleshes out the sequence of practice.
* The incongruity is compounded by the addition of body contemplations at the end.

# 42

* There's a tendency towards inflating mindfulness of the body until it encompasses the whole path.
* Satipaṭṭhāna provides an example on a larger scale, covering much of the same ground as the later sections.
* The inclusion of additional practices in the Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra is largely redundant, suggesting they were originally intended for the Kāyagatāsmṛti Sūtra.

# 43

* Having considered the body contemplation section, we move on to the remainder.
* The refrain in the Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra speaks of contemplating internally and externally, then establishing the mind on body (feelings, mind, dhammas) and obtaining knowledge, vision, light, understanding.

# 44

* The Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta mentions establishing mindfulness for a measure of knowledge and mindfulness.
* There may have been confusion between 'measure' (*matta*) and other words like 'attainment' or 'purpose'.


# 45

* The sections on feelings and mind in the Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra are similar to the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta but more elaborate.
* From here to the end, the text refers to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs as the audience and meditator.

# 46

* The section on contemplation of dhammas compares between the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra and Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* Both Suttas describe these exercises in virtually identical terms, as do Abhidhamma versions.

# 47

* The Sarvāstivāda omits aggregates and truths, retaining sense media as the only vipassanā practice.
* There's a text in the Bojjhaṅga-saṁyutta that mentions sense media, where awakening-factors are said to be the 'one dhamma' for abandoning fetters.

# 48

* The Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra omits repetition of the 'way to convergence' statement but includes a guarantee of attainment in seven years or as little as seven days.
* It also omits the final sentence found only in the Pali version, which may be an attempt to tie together loose passages.

# 49

* The emphasis throughout the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra is clearly on samatha.
* Like the Vibhaṅga, it omits virtually all overtly vipassanā material and adds much samatha material.
* Both schools were moving towards using Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as a compilation of meditation techniques; but for the Sarvāstivādins this was a samatha manual, while for the Theravādins it was a vipassanā manual.

## 14.3 Ekāyana Sūtra

* This discourse is from the Ekottara Āgama, believed to belong to the Mahāsaṅghika school of Buddhism.
* The affiliation of the Ekottara is uncertain due to inconsistencies in its doctrines and style compared to known Mahāsaṅghika teachings.
* Despite these uncertainties, the text is often treated as Mahāsaṅghika because of references to Maitreya, a Buddha of the future revered by this school.

* The text's careless editing and divergence from other sources suggest a later date than the Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and the Sarvāstivāda Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra.
* The setting in Jetavana, while common in Suttas, might indicate a different discourse or occasion compared to other versions.

* The Chinese translation of 'satipaṭṭhāna' as 'mind-tranquillity' (意止) is unusual but found in other texts as well.
* The Ekāyana Sūtra mentions the five hindrances and presents the eightfold path, albeit in an unconventional order.
* Unlike the Theravāda Suttas, the refrains throughout the Ekāyana Sūtra vary considerably.

* The text emphasizes the 'way to convergence' because it leads to oneness of mind, a concept highlighted by its inclusion in the 'Ones' of the Ekottara Āgama.
* The body contemplation section omits ānāpānasati and awareness of activities, focusing on parts of the body, four elements, charnel ground contemplations, and observing bodily openings.

* Contemplations of feeling and mind are similar to other versions but with different refrains.
* The text includes formulas for attaining arahantship, likely later additions.
* A phrase '可思惟.不可思惟' in the contemplation of mind is difficult to translate, possibly referring to contemplating what is beyond thought or reason.

* The dhammas section only mentions the seven awakening-factors and four jhānas, presented simply without inquiry into causes.
* The description of awakening-factors resembles the four modes of contemplation of dhammas in ānāpānasati.
* The ending with the four jhānas echoes the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, reaffirming satipaṭṭhāna's role in leading to jhāna.

* The absence of inquiry into causes in the contemplation of dhammas distinguishes this version from others.
* This text might have been deliberately formed as a counterpoint to the vipassanā interpretation of satipaṭṭhāna favored by ābhidhammikas.




# 14.4 Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta

* The Theravāda Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta was likely formed by selecting the Vibhaṅga Mūla from the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta and expanding it with additional meditation exercises and refrains.
* The inclusion of 14 new exercises, originally found in the Kāyagatāsati Sutta, is unproblematic as satipaṭṭhāna is closely related to ānāpānasati.
* Sections on clear comprehension and body postures, typically separate from satipaṭṭhāna, were added, possibly to elevate ānāpānasati's importance but potentially leading to misinterpretations about the practice.
* The refrain was expanded with a section on impermanence from the Samudaya Sutta, emphasizing vipassanā from the beginning of practice.

* This extended refrain contributes to both a horizontal and vertical dimension within each meditation exercise, progressing towards liberation.
* Sections on feelings and mind are similar to other versions.
* The dhammas section is significantly lengthened with contemplations of aggregates and sense media, which may be later interpolations as they contradict the normal position of the Suttas regarding attention's role in their origin.

* The contemplation of dhammas includes discussions of impermanence within each exercise, potentially indicating the merging of two originally distinct texts.
* The dhammas section concludes with a brief enunciation of the four noble truths, expanded greatly in the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya.

* Some Burmese recensions have re-incorporated this section from the Dīgha Nikāya back into the Majjhima Nikāya, highlighting an unusual case of canonical innovation.

# 85 A similarly obvious bias is apparent in the Vipassanā Research Institute's (vri) online version of the Tipitaka

* The Majjhima Nikāya lists discourses by title, but singles out the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta by listing its sections.
* This bias reflects the meditative focus of those who compiled these Tipitaka recensions.

# 86 Such partisan manipulation ofsacred scriptures has only one good consequence: no-one can reasonably insist that the Tipitaka must have remained unchanged for all time.

* No bullet points needed

# 87 The Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is the only significant discourse in the Dīgha Nikāya that is not found in the Dharmaguptaka Dīrgha Āgama

* It's also absent from the Sarvāstivāda Dīrgha.
* This makes it a contender for the latest discourse in the four Nikāyas, possibly originating from early abhidhamma.
* It's duplicated in both the Majjhima and Dīgha, further supporting its anomalous character.

# 88 The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta treats the four noble truths by merely stating them.

* This formulation often indicates vipassanā realization, but here it could express the results of previous sections' practice.
* The Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta gathers material from elsewhere, resulting in the longest exposition of the truths, doubling the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta's length.

# 89 The new material is mainly identical with the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta.

* No bullet points needed

# 25 The Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta adds a lengthy analysis of the second and third noble truths to the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta material.

* This analysis is structured around dhammas for each sense media: external, internal, cognition, contact, feeling, perception, volition, craving, initial application, sustained application.
* The Saṁyutta Nikāya includes a similar list with elements and aggregates instead of initial & sustained application.

# 26 Nevertheless, a similar list, again omitting the final two members, is found in the Sarvāstivāda Satyavibhaṅga Sūtra.

* No bullet points needed

# 90 This list is an expanded form of the psychological analysis of the cognitive process first enunciated in the third discourse, the Ādittapariyāya Sutta.

* It evolved into the *cittavīthi*, the definitive exposition of psychological processes worked out by later ābhidhammikas.
* Thus, the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta bridges to the Abhidhamma.

# 91 Needless to say, most of the new material in the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is vipassanā oriented.

* This continues the trend observed in satipaṭṭhāna texts within the Pali canon.
* The exposition ends with the four jhānas as right samādhi, restating satipaṭṭhāna's function to lead to jhāna in the eightfold path.

# 92 The significance of the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta can best be understood in light of the Dīgha Nikāya's structure.

* The most authentic teaching sets out the heart of Dhamma practice.
* The Dīgha starts with twelve discourses expounding gradual training, including the four jhānas.
* This section may have been the original core around which the Dīgha was formed.

# 93 There is little vipassanā material in the Dīgha.

* A striking example is the rarity of the five aggregates.
* Meditation on the aggregates is mentioned only in legendary context, elsewhere they receive bare enunciation in proto-abhidhamma compilations.

# 94 The compilers of the Theravāda Dīgha Nikāya wished to include more vipassanā material.

* Three texts treat mindfulness practice: Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, Ānāpānasati Sutta, and Kāyagatāsati Sutta.
* They chose the most vipassanā oriented text (Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta) and padded it out with further vipassanā material to redress the Dīgha Nikāya's imbalance.

# 95 We can pin down a little more precisely the date of the formation of the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.

* It's absent from both the Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka Dīrghas, which split after Aśoka.
* The Theravāda were based in Sri Lanka from the Aśokan period.

# 96 This raises the possibility that the final editing of the Pali Nikāyas was carried out on Sri Lankan soil.

* Much of the Vinaya Parivāra was composed in Sri Lanka.
* The restructuring of the Vinaya Piṭaka is unique to Sri Lanka and may be a Sinhalese development.
* Several sections of the Khuddaka Nikāya are Sri Lankan.

# 97 However, despite this strong evidence, some verses are included in the Sanskrit version.

* This contains the verse 'There were eight measures of the relics…' and that on the teeth relics.
* It is unlikely a Sinhalese composition found its way into a Sanskrit text in north India.




# Chapter 15 The Source

* The author proposes reconstructing the authentic source material for the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* This approach is preferable to simply abandoning analysis due to textual complexities.
* A reconstructed text provides a clearer understanding of the satipaṭṭhāna teachings.

#  


* A table summarizes the contents of satipaṭṭhāna across different recensions, highlighting continuities and discontinuities.
* The table doesn't distinguish between Theravāda Dīgha and Majjhima. 

#  

* The Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla is edited based on seven early texts detailing satipaṭṭhāna.
* These texts share commonalities, suggesting descent from a single source.
* The most likely content of this source is the material shared by all texts.

# 


* Unshared material isn't automatically excluded from the Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla.
*  The absence of similes in the Vibhaṅga doesn't imply their absence from the source, as Abhidhamma typically omits them.
* The Ekāyana Sūtra, being late and inconsistently edited, is treated with caution.
* Generally, the Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla includes material found in all texts but may occasionally incorporate phrases present in only four or five.

# The Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla

* This text is similar to the Theravāda Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga, minus special Abhidhamma material and free of anomalies found elsewhere.
* It was not mechanically produced by assuming concordance but considered internal coherence, intertextual relationships, cultural context, evolution of sectarian positions, etc.
* The resulting text is internally logical, consistent with satipaṭṭhāna teachings, and resembles existing texts.

# Rationale for Reconstruction

* The traditional explanation that the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas were spoken by the Buddha and preserved verbatim is implausible due to divergences between existing texts.
* This reconstruction offers a rational alternative based on historical-critical methodology, accounting for existing texts, enhancing understanding, allowing inferences about doctrinal evolution, and being useful for practice.

# Setting, Audience, and Other Choices

* The original setting was likely Kammassadamma but is omitted from the *Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla to emphasize that it's not part of the discourse itself.
* The discourse is addressed to monks and nuns (though male pronouns are retained for convenience) based on the Sarvāstivāda example.

# Specific Elements

* **Path to Convergence:** Included despite doubts due to agreement among Suttas.
* **Auxiliary formula:** Included due to agreement with Abhidhamma texts and Prajñāpāramitā, assuming loss in other Suttas was due to abridgement.
* **Internal/external:** Integrated version presented due to weight of sources.
* **Body contemplation:** Simile included as found in most versions.
* **Refrain:** Common elements retained despite problems with individual refrains.
* **Ending:** "Path to convergence" repeated, but guarantee of attainment omitted as it appears only in two versions.

# *Satipaṭṭhāna Mūla

* This text describes the Satipaṭṭhāna, which are the four foundations of mindfulness. It's presented as a path to purification, overcoming suffering, and achieving enlightenment (Nibbana).

# Mindfulness of Body

* A practitioner contemplates their body both internally and externally.
* They observe various parts of the body with clarity and without attachment.
* This practice cultivates awareness of the physical form and its impermanent nature.

# Mindfulness of Feeling

* One observes feelings as they arise, recognizing them as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
* Feelings are categorized as carnal or spiritual, further refining the understanding.
* This practice develops equanimity towards sensations and reduces reactivity.

# Mindfulness of Mind

* The practitioner becomes aware of different mental states such as lust, anger, delusion, contraction, distraction, etc.
* They observe these states without judgment, recognizing their arising and passing away.
* This cultivates insight into the nature of the mind and its workings.

# Mindfulness of Dhammas

* One contemplates various mental phenomena, including defilements like sensual desire, anger, sloth, restlessness, doubt.
* They also cultivate awareness of awakening factors such as mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquillity, samādhi, and equanimity.
* This practice deepens understanding of the Dharma (teachings) and leads to liberation.

## * **

**Chapter 16 Sarvāstivāda & Theravāda**

* This chapter examines doctrinal developments within Buddhism by comparing the teachings of the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda schools, focusing on their versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
* The analysis aims to identify sectarian differences in understanding satipaṭṭhāna practice and vipassanā (insight).

**16.1 Theravāda And Vipassanā**

* The Theravāda version of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta emphasizes vipassanā as a systematic analysis of phenomena, suggesting an Abhidhamma influence.
* Examples include the Anupada Sutta and Chachakka Sutta, which display characteristics of Abhidhamma style and content.
* The Theravāda's focus on pure insight is contrasted with the Sarvāstivāda's inclusion of samatha (tranquility) practices in their version of the Chachakka Sutta.
* Subtle differences in the presentation of vipassanā, such as the emphasis on detachment from aggregates across time in the Sarvāstivāda version, highlight diverging perspectives.

* These textual variations suggest a gradual shift towards vipassanā as a primary practice within the Theravāda tradition.




## 16.2 Sarvāstivāda And Samādhi

* The Sarvāstivāda emphasis on samādhi is apparent in their Madhyama Āgama.

* Several discourses deal with jhāna, highlighting the importance of meditative practice in this school.

## 16.2.1 Dependent Liberation

* This doctrinal framework, also known as 'transcendental dependant origination', presents a series of factors leading to Nibbana.
* The Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta Āgama includes a saṁyutta on this theme, with versions found in MA 44, MA 54, and MA 55.

## 16.2.2 The Teachings Of Anuruddha

* Venerable Anuruddha, known for his meditative prowess, delivers several discourses in the Sarvāstivāda Madhyama Āgama.
* This suggests a greater emphasis on samādhi teachings by Anuruddha in the Sarvāstivāda tradition compared to the Theravāda.

## 16.2.3 Miscellaneous

* MA 176 describes four types of meditators based on their perception of progress or regression.
* MA 117 outlines eight types of meditators categorized by their attainment and practice.
* MA 222 lists various practices necessary for understanding the twelve links of dependent origination, including the four satipaṭṭhānas and jhānas.

##  Differences Between Theravāda And Sarvāstivāda


* The Sarvāstivāda emphasized devotion, meditation, and forest dwelling, while the Theravāda leaned towards intellectualism and urban monasticism.
* This difference is reflected in their respective patriarchs: Mahā Kassapa for the Sarvāstivāda, known for his ascetic lifestyle, and Sāriputta for the Theravāda, renowned for his wisdom.

* The Sarvāstivāda frequently mention the use of a sitting cloth for meditation, indicating a preference for forest practice.
* The Sarvāstivāda Madhyama Āgama sometimes includes miraculous elements absent in the Theravāda texts.
* The Sarvāstivāda show more emphasis on devotional practices and address the Buddha with titles like 'World Honoured One'.

* Early Sarvāstivāda Abhidhamma retains a less specialized mode of analysis compared to the Theravāda Abhidhamma, reflecting their less scholastic approach.

## 16.3 The Demon Of Time

* The Sarvāstivādins emphasized continuity in time through samatha meditation, while the Theravādins focused on impermanence through vipassanā.
* This difference stemmed from the Sarvāstivādins' belief that all dhammas exist simultaneously, past, present, and future, while the Theravādins adhered to a theory of momentariness where each dhamma arises and passes away instantly.

## The Myth Of Upagupta And Māra

* The myth illustrates the Sarvāstivādins' desire to preserve the Buddha's teachings and presence despite his passing.
* It highlights the tension between worshipping the Buddha as an idol and accepting the impermanence of all things.

##  The Widening Fracture

* A divide emerged between popular Buddhism, which emphasized continuity and connection to the past, and scholastic Buddhism, which focused on momentariness and abstract dhammas.
* This fracture led to the emergence of the Bodhisatta doctrine in folk Buddhism.

## The Nervousness Of Abhidhamma

* Despite their emphasis on momentariness, Theravāda Abhidhamma scholars displayed a neurotic need to fixate on unchanging dhammas, suggesting an underlying fear of impermanence.

# 16.4 The Vibhaṅga'S Abhidhamma Exposition

* This section examines satipaṭṭhāna purely within the context of 'transcendental jhāna', a concept unique to the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.

* It highlights how closely the early Theravāda school linked satipaṭṭhāna with their understanding of jhāna.
* The passage adapts the standard description of transcendental jhāna from the Dhammasaṅgaṇī, explaining how a monk achieves enlightenment through this state.

# Continuities and Discontinuities

* Basic descriptions of jhāna and satipaṭṭhāna align with those found in the Suttas.
* The close relationship between the two is also present in the Suttas, although not as comprehensively equated as here.
* The mention of a 'painful way of practice' within jhāna is incongruous.

# Association and Tension

* Satipaṭṭhāna is defined simply as *sati*, the act of mindfulness.
* Other dhammas are said to be 'associated with satipaṭṭhāna', revealing tension in applying a strictly abhidhammic interpretation.

# Transcendental Jhāna

* The Theravāda later interpreted transcendental jhāna as a single 'mind moment' before enlightenment, but this text shouldn't be read through that lens.
* The concept of 'moments' wasn't fully developed at the time.

# Time and Context

* The Abhidhamma Piṭaka aims for universal truth, unlike the Sutta and Vinaya Piṭakas which ground teachings in specific contexts.

# Duration and Object

* The description of transcendental jhāna implies duration, using the verb 'abides'.
* Transcendental jhāna differs from non-transcendental jhāna in terms of object (emptiness vs. meditation subjects) and result (enlightenment vs. rebirth).

# Confusion and Interpretation

* The Vibhaṅga struggles to apply the transcendental jhāna concept consistently, particularly regarding the object of contemplation.
* Later traditions attempted to clarify this, suggesting that mindfulness with Nibbana as its object encompasses all satipaṭṭhānas.


# Vipassanā in the Background

* Vipassanā is largely absent from this exposition, despite the mention of 'emptiness'.

# Jhāna and Satipaṭṭhāna

* The Abhidhamma emphasizes jhāna's intrinsic role in satipaṭṭhāna, aligning with the Sutta saying that 'samādhi is the path'.
* Later interpretations misconstrued transcendental jhāna as a substitute for practicing jhāna on the eightfold path.

## 16.5 Other Abhidhamma Texts

* The Puggala Paññatti suggests jhāna might be superfluous from the path, presenting a view that contradicts the Suttas' emphasis on developing both samatha and vipassanā.
* This text introduces incongruities regarding attaining transcendental jhāna without non-transcendental jhāna.

## Chapter 17 Later Buddhism

* The chapter will explore statements on mindfulness in later Buddhist texts to trace the continuity between earlier perspectives on satipaṭṭhāna and later traditions.

## 17.1 The Theravāda Commentaries

* Material on satipaṭṭhāna is found in commentaries for the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta as well as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta in the Majjhima and Dīgha, and also the Vibhaṅga.
* The Saṁyutta commentary often gives brief explanations while the Majjhima commentary offers lengthy elaborations on the same phrases. This suggests a later development of the Majjhima commentary.
* Both commentaries mention places or people in Sri Lanka, but the Saṁyutta does so less often.

* Elders offer different opinions on what 'satipaṭṭhāna', 'awakening-factors', and 'supreme awakening' mean. All equate satipaṭṭhāna with vipassanā.
* The Satipaṭṭhāna-saṁyutta's references to samādhi are explained away using terms like 'momentary samādhi' and 'threshold samādhi'.

* The Majjhima Nikāya Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta commentary subjects each aspect of satipaṭṭhāna to a detailed exposition utilizing the abhidhammic and commentarial systems.
* There is strong emphasis on vipassanā throughout; nevertheless, the samatha perspective is not completely neglected.

* The commentary says that 'mindfulness' means samatha while 'clear comprehension' means vipassanā.
* In the discussion on ānāpānasati it states that the four jhānas arise in the sign of breathing.
* The section on clear comprehension advises against over-enthusiastic yogis experiencing pain due to prolonged meditation postures.

* The Sub-commentary adds that mindfulness denotes samādhi too, and confusion is a state of mind jumping from thing to thing.
* It states that if wisdom is not strong in the development of concentration there will be no contemplative attainment.


## 17.2 Developments In Sarvāstivāda

* Venerable Śāṇakavāsin, preceptor of Upagupta, was a forest meditator who attained the five stages of jhāna.
* Upagupta took over Śāṇakavāsin's monastery at Mount Urumuṇḍa, known for being conducive to samatha.

* A difference in attitude towards mindfulness is evidenced in the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda Abhidhammas.
* The Theravādins consider mindfulness an exclusively skilful mental quality while the Sarvāstivādins treat it as both good and bad.

* The Sarvāstivādins view sati as 'not-forgetting' or 'retention' of the object, suggesting the samatha dimension of mindfulness.

* The Dharmaskandha forms the basis for the canonical Abhidhamma of the school while the Jñānapraṣṭhāna is its culmination.
* The chapter on satipaṭṭhāna in the Jñānapraṣṭhāna contains verbatim quoting and commentary, mainly devoted to the four jhānas.

* Contemplation of dhammas includes the five hindrances, six sense media with fetters, and seven awakening-factors.

* The Abhidharmasāra of Dharmaśrī is one of the earliest Abhidharma philosophical systems.
* There are no individual correspondences between Dharmaśrī's account and the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta regarding contemplation of the body.

* In Dharmaśrī's version, there is no mention of entry into jhāna for attaining liberating cognition.
* The only mention of jhāna in the Abhidharmasāra is the 'peak non-transcendental dhamma', which fulfills the same function as the 'transcendental jhāna' of the Theravāda.

## 17.3 The Abhidharmakośa

* Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa defines satipaṭṭhāna as 'understanding' (*paññā*) rather than mindfulness.
* This definition leads to inconsistencies, placing satipaṭṭhāna with right view instead of right mindfulness.
* The Sarvāstivāda path is divided into five stages: preparation, reaching, vision, development, and adept.
* Satipaṭṭhāna is considered part of the 'path of preparation' alongside practices like ānāpānasati.
*  The Kośa defines ānāpānasati as 'understanding', suggesting a broad understanding of the term in Sarvāstivāda theory.
* The text claims that ānāpānasati is cultivated with neutral feeling, contradicting meditative experience and Suttas.

* The Kośa separates ānāpānasati and body contemplation from satipaṭṭhāna, treating them as preliminaries.
* Satipaṭṭhāna in the Kośa focuses on vipassanā aspects developed after jhāna, differing from the Abhidharmasāra which omits jhāna altogether.

* The text emphasizes the general characteristics of impermanence, suffering, etc., when discussing satipaṭṭhāna.
* While emphasizing vipassanā, the Kośa acknowledges the importance of ānāpānasati and body contemplation as precursors to insight.


## 42 Or In The Context Of The Spiritual Faculties:

*  The Kośa outlines a sequence for developing spiritual faculties, placing satipaṭṭhāna before samādhi.
* This preserves continuity with early teachings but creates confusion by treating various frameworks as distinct stages rather than complementary perspectives.

## 17.4 Other Early Schools 17.4.1 Bahuśrutīya

* The Bahuśrutīya school, known for their emphasis on dry insight, uses the Susīma Sutta to justify a path requiring less concentration than jhāna.
* Their interpretation of the Susīma Sutta differs from both Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda versions.
*  The Satyasiddhiśāstra, a Bahuśrutīya text, analyzes the 37 wings to awakening as either samatha or vipassanā.

* It classifies the first three satipaṭṭhānas as samatha and contemplation of dhammas as vipassanā.
* This aligns with early Suttas, Vibhaṅga Mūla, and potentially the Sarvāstivāda in spirit.

## 17.4.2 Puggalavāda

* The Puggalavāda school believed in a 'person' distinct from the five aggregates who experiences rebirth, karma results, and Nirvana.
* They were criticized by other schools for reverting to a 'self' concept but remained influential for over 1000 years.
* Their main surviving text is the Tridharmakaśāstra, attributed to Giribhadra and focusing on good acts, skillful roots, means, and samādhi.
* The text emphasizes the 'person' when interpreting Buddha's teachings on contemplation.
* It replaces the four jhānas with three samādhis due to its focus on triads.

## 17.4.3 Chinese Commentaries

* Leon Hurvitz translated Āgama sūtras on satipaṭṭhāna and Chinese commentaries by Fa Sheng and others.
* These commentaries emphasize vipassanā, dependent origination, Abhidhamma analysis, and the role of samatha in producing right knowledge.
* Body contemplation exercises include ānāpānasati, ugliness, and elements.
* The commentaries define 'dhammas' as perception and conceptual activities, and suggest that contemplating all dhammas includes the four satipaṭṭhānas.
* They warn about the potential for distraction when contemplating all dhammas and emphasize the importance of focusing on impermanence, emptiness, not-self, and suffering.

## 17.4.4 Mūlasarvāstivāda

* Difficult to isolate specific doctrinal differences between Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda.
* Some scholars suggest they are the same, but this is not convincing due to polemical texts aiming to exalt one school over another.
* The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya differs from other Sarvāstivāda Vinayas, suggesting a distinct school rather than just a sub-sect.

## Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra

* A long and elaborate text composed by the Mūlasarvāstivādins in the style of contemporary Mahāyāna sūtras.
* Includes doctrinal and meditative material, descriptions of heavens and hells, and references to arts like painting and theatre.
* Popularizes satipaṭṭhāna by placing it within contemporary cultural movements.

## Passage on Death

* Describes visions experienced during death, including a rocky mountain, white and red cloth, and bright light.
* These visions can cause confusion and lead to perverse thoughts related to rebirth.
* Compares the process of rebirth to an imprint left by a die.
* Highlights the connection between satipaṭṭhāna, understanding rebirth, and overcoming confusion through mindfulness.



## 17.5 The Mahāyāna

* The Mahāyāna texts emphasize the complementary nature of samatha (tranquility) and vipassanā (insight), reflecting a monistic philosophical orientation that sees them as contributing to a greater whole.
* Several Mahāyāna writings highlight the integrative approach of "samatha conjoined with vipassanā," emphasizing the balance between tranquility and insight in the path to enlightenment.

## Satipaṭṭhāna in Mahāyāna Texts

* The Mahāyāna Sūtras often incorporate passages from early Suttas on satipaṭṭhāna, demonstrating its enduring importance across Buddhist schools.
* The *Sūtra of Assembled Treasures* emphasizes the vipassanā aspect of satipaṭṭhāna, highlighting the role of mindfulness in overcoming clinging to a sense of self.

* The Avataṁsaka Sūtra includes satipaṭṭhāna as part of the fourth stage ("Blazing") in the Bodhisattva's progress, using the standard formula found in early Suttas.
* Santideva's *Śikṣāsamuccaya* incorporates various teachings on satipaṭṭhāna from other Mahāyānist works, showcasing its use in doctrinal debates and sectarian contexts.

* The Dharmasaṅgīti Sūtra includes a powerful passage on the contemplation of body that critiques the Sarvāstivāda doctrine of time.

## 17.5.1 The Samādhi Of Meeting The Buddhas Of The Present

* This section discusses a text called the 'Buddhas of the Present Sūtra', which focuses on the practice of satipaṭṭhāna leading to seeing Buddhas.
*  The text emphasizes not objectifying or conceptualizing dhammas during meditation, aiming for unobscured cognition and samādhi.
* This state allows one to see immeasurable Buddhas and hear true Dhamma.
* The text suggests that meditative visions can be interpreted as teachings from the Buddha himself, blurring the lines between subjective experience and objective reality.

## 17.6 Yogacāra

* This section explores mindfulness within the Yogacāra school, known for their "mind only" philosophy.
*  Yogacara asserts that mind creates the world we experience, but they don't deny the existence of anything outside the mind.
* Early Yogacarins like Vasubandhu and Asaṅga believed even the fundamental 'storehouse consciousness' ceases in Nibbana.

## 17.6.1 Asaṅga

* Asaṅga was a key figure in Yogacāra Buddhism who lived in the 4th century CE.
* He converted his brother Vasubandhu from Sautrāntika to Yogacāra and was inspired by Maitreya, the Bodhisattva awaiting rebirth as a Buddha.
* His major work, the *Yogacārabhūmiśāstra*, is extensive, but the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* offers a more manageable summary of Mahāyāna teachings.

## Mindfulness in Asaṅga's Abhidharmasamuccaya

* Mindfulness is defined as "non-forgetting by the mind with regard to the object experienced" and its function is "non-distraction."
* Samādhi is defined as "one-pointedness of mind on the object to be investigated," providing a basis for knowledge.
* These definitions emphasize sustained observation (*anupassanā*) and non-distraction, aligning with *satipaṭṭhāna*.

## Satipaṭṭhāna in Asaṅga's Abhidharmasamuccaya

* The path is described as starting with gradual training (ethics, sense control, etc.) followed by wisdom gained through hearing, thinking, and meditating.
* Samatha and vipassanā are mentioned without detailed explanation.
* Satipaṭṭhāna is explained in terms of objects, intrinsic essence, companion, and development.

##  Objects of Contemplation

* Body, feelings, mind, dhammas, and "things relating to oneself."

## Intrinsic Essence

* Understanding and mindfulness.

## Companion

* Associated mind and mentality.

## Development

* Contemplation of a body in the body, etc., internally/externally/internally-externally.
* Internal: Internal material sense media.
* External: External material sense media.
* Internal-external: The external sense media linked to internal sense media, and internal material spheres pertaining to others.

## Contemplation of "Body in the Body"

* Refers to developing a visualized reflex-image in meditation (*paṭibhāganimitta*), similar to a mirror image of the body or breath.


## Satipaṭṭhāna and the Five Spiritual Faculties

* Mindfulness supports samādhi, highlighting their interconnectedness.
* Right effort dispels major defilements, right mindfulness dispels minor defilements, and right samādhi dispels impediments to qualities of distinction.



## Satipaṭṭhāna in Asaṅga's Śrāvakabhūmi

* Contemplation of the body lists 35 diverse kinds of "body," differing from the Suttas.
* Satipaṭṭhānas are presented as opposed to the four perversions.
* A unique reflection on the differences between satipaṭṭhānas is offered:
    * Where one acts (body)
    * Purpose for which [one acts] (feeling)
    * Who does the action (mind)
    * By what does one act (skilful and unskilful dhammas)

## 17.6.2 Vasubandhu

*  Vasubandhu's commentary on verses attributed to Maitreyanātha attempts to rationalize the traditional order of the wings to awakening as a progressive sequence.
* The text equates the four satipaṭṭhānas with the respective noble truths and defines mindfulness as 'the lack of loss of image, etc. of the meditation object'.

* It explains the difference between the spiritual faculties and spiritual powers in terms of progressive stages of the path according to the Sarvāstivāda system.
* The text asserts three features distinguishing Mahāyānist satipaṭṭhāna: 1) the object of meditation for bodhisattvas includes both their own and others' bodies, 2) bodhisattvas practice non-apprehension of bodies, and 3) bodhisattvas cultivate satipaṭṭhāna for Nirvana which has no abode.

## 17.7 Mādhyamaka

* The Mādhyamaka school was known for its sophisticated dialectic but also had a meditation manual called Bhāvanākrama by Kamalaśīla.
* This manual describes the general path as mastering scriptural and theoretical aspects, developing samādhi, and then undertaking vipassanā.

## 17.7.1 Bhāvanākrama

* The course of vipassanā is derived from the doctrinal evolution of schools through history, culminating in the ultimate emptiness of the Mādhyamaka.
* This evolution parallels the four satipaṭṭhānas: 1) contemplation of external realities (Sarvāstivāda and Sautrāntika), 2) contemplation of the mind with manifested images (Satyākāravāda-Yogacāra), 3) contemplation of cognition itself (Alīkākāravāda-yogacārin), and 4) contemplation of pure emptiness.
* This parallelism highlights a natural progression from coarse to fine, reflecting the principles of the four satipaṭṭhānas in various contexts.

# 17.7.2 Meditation On Emptiness

* Mindfulness is non-forgetfulness with respect to a familiar phenomenon; its function is causing non-distraction.
* It has three features: an objective feature (a familiar object), a subjective feature (non-forgetfulness within observation of that object), and a functional feature (causing non-distraction).

* Hopkins presents some charts summarizing the Tibetan conception of the stages in the development of samatha, including five faults in samatha together with their remedies.
* Mindfulness appears in its old sense of 'memory'.
* The nine aspects of samatha are identical to the definition of samatha in the Abhidharmasamuccaya and have been taken from there or a related source.

# Afterword

* It is important to see Buddhist scriptures in their historical and cultural context, as this can lead to conclusions that could not be reached relying on Buddhist sources alone.
* A holistic approach to studying Dhamma is crucial, treating individual limbs as part of the greater organism. 
* The Saṁyutta is likely the oldest strata of Buddhist scriptures and was possibly current during the Buddha's lifetime.

* Comparative studies are important for understanding similarities between traditions.
* While stressing the importance of the pre-Buddhist environment, it is also significant to consider later sources.
* Later accretions in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta should be considered alongside the authentic material.
* An approach to meditation that emphasizes the essential harmony and complementariness of samatha and vipassanā should be a healing force.
