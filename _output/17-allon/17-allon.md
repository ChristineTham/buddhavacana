## Introduction

* Early Buddhist texts in Pali canonical *sutta*s were designed for memorization and verbatim transmission.
* Communal recitation required fixed wording to avoid chaos.
* Despite this, Buddhist communities made changes to the texts they transmitted.
* This work examines how these changes occurred, why they happened, and the challenge they pose to the idea of oral transmission requiring fixity.

## Early Buddhist Texts

* "Early Buddhist texts" refers to canonical sutras and verse collections like the Dhammapada/Dharmapada/*Udānavarga*s found in various nikāya communities.
* The oldest manuscripts are Gandhari texts dating from approximately the 1st century BCE to the 3rd or 4th century CE.
* Dating these texts is complex, but many likely stem from the period immediately after the Buddha's death.

## What is an Early Buddhist Sutra?


* An early Buddhist sutra presents itself as a sutra, has specific stylistic features, aligns with early Buddhist thought, and belongs to nikāya/*āgama* collections.
* Even if the current form post-dates Aśoka, its origins likely lie in the pre-Aśokan period.

## Agreement and Age of Texts

* Some scholars believe that agreement between parallel versions indicates an older common source.
* Others argue that similarities are due to later leveling and harmonization of traditions.
* Evidence suggests borrowings and communication between textual schools did occur.

# Regarding What Constitutes a Sutra

* The application of the term "sutra" can be broader than commonly thought.
* Examples include the Anavatapta-*gāthā*, which is classed as an *avadāna* but considered a sutra by compilers of a Gandhari anthology.
* The Pali Suttasaṅ*gaha also includes texts not traditionally classified as *sutta*s.

# The Scope of "Sutra" in This Study

* This study restricts the use of "sutra" to textual units making up the four main nikāyas/*āgama*s, Suttanipāta, *Udāna*, and Itivuttaka/*Ityuktaka*.
* These texts report the words of the Buddha and his monastics and are marked as sutras by a *nidāna* recording where the Buddha was dwelling.

# Sutra vs. Discourse

* Early Buddhist sutras can be prose, verse, or a mixture of both.
* "Discourse" is used for any religious talk given by the Buddha or one of his monastics.
* "Sutra" refers to a discrete and independent textual unit preserving a discourse.

# Functions of Early Buddhist Sutras

* Recording teachings, ideas, actions of the Buddha and his community for instruction and guidance.
* Inspiring converts, motivating the converted, and attracting financial supporters.

# Stylistic Features of Sutra Prose

* Preference for prose over verse, possibly due to perceived limitations of metrical structures or its suitability for oral transmission.
* Repetition is a key feature, likely used to ensure successful transmission given the limited "literary" training of community members.

# Structure of Sutras

* Standard structure includes: introductory setting (*nidāna*), Buddha-monk interchange, the teaching/discourse, and conclusion.
* The discourse itself often follows a highly structured and repetitive pattern, using rhetorical questions and summaries to present concepts clearly.




# Repetition and Structure in Canonical Prose

* The importance of repetition is evident in the *brahmavihāra* formula.
* Textual economy could have been achieved by listing all four *brahmavihāra*s together, but repetition is used for emphasis.

# String Structures and Syllable Patterns

* Canonical prose often uses strings of grammatically parallel units (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs) that express similar ideas.
* These strings are carefully crafted with waxing syllable patterns, sound similarities, and metrical repetitions.
* Examples include:
    * *unnādino uccāsadda-mahāsaddā* ("exclaiming loudly, with a loud noise, with a great noise")
    * *majjati mucchati pamādam āpajjati* ("he is intoxicated, infatuated, and careless")

# Building Blocks in Prose

* Canonical prose uses building blocks of paired words or related textual units.
* Examples include:
    * *te paribbājakā* ("those ascetics")
    * *unnādino uccāsadda-mahāsaddā* ("exclaiming loudly, with a loud noise, with a great noise")

# Metrical Prose

* Some canonical prose is metrical, using the *veḍha* metre.
* The *iti pi so* formula describing the Buddha, his teaching, and his community is a well-known example of metrical prose.

# Repetition in Early Buddhist Prose

- Repetition is a prominent feature of early Buddhist prose.
- Examples include verbatim repetition, repetition with minor modifications, and metrical patterns.
- These repetitions likely aided memorization and transmission of texts.

# Formulas in Early Buddhist Texts

- Formulas are standardized wording used to depict concepts, actions, or events.
- The description of the four *brahmavihāra* and introductions/conclusions of sermons are examples.
- Formulas contribute to the memorability and aesthetic appeal of the texts.

# Evidence from Within Canonical Texts

- References within early Buddhist texts suggest a focus on memorization and recitation.
- Examples include Soṇa reciting the sixteen *sutta*s of the *Aṭṭhakavagga*, laymen quoting verses, and monks learning the Pātimokkha.

# Formation of Sutra and Verse Collections

- Similar textual units were organized into larger collections like nikāyas/*āgama*s and verse collections (Dhammapada/*Dharmapada*, Theragāthā, *Therīgāthā*).
- These collections were further subdivided into vagga/vargas, saṃyutta/saṃ*yukta*s, and *nipāta*s.
- The organization aimed to facilitate memorization and transmission of the material.

# Bhāṇavāra

* *Bhāṇavāra*s are found in various Buddhist canonical texts, including those from different schools.
* The Dīrghāgama and Madhyamāgama have four *bhāṇavāra*s, while the Saṃyuktāgama has ten.
* These divisions likely served as "recitations" due to their length, allowing for completion within a day.

# Organizational Principles in Buddhist Texts

* Genre is a common organizational principle, with collections like the Aṭṭhakavagga and Pārāyana*vagga consisting entirely of verse.
* Many texts group *sutta*s containing verse at the beginning.
* Some texts order *sutta*s or verses according to the number they contain, starting from the fewest to the most.

# Numerical Ordering

* A numerical organizing principle is found in various Buddhist texts, including the Aṅguttara-nikāya/*Ekottarikāgama*.
* This principle also appears in pre-Buddhist Indian texts like the *gveda*, Jain texts, and parts of the *Mahābhārata*.

# Other Organizational Principles

* Subject matter or key words are used to arrange *sutta*s or verses into groups.
* Texts often group *sutta*s involving the same class of individuals (deities, monks, etc.).
* Literary features like similes can also be used for grouping *sutta*s.


# Concatenation

* Concatenation involves pairing or grouping textual units based on factors like keywords, subject matter, individuals, numerical principles, figures of speech, etc.
* This principle is prevalent in many Buddhist texts and other Indian literary traditions.

# Example: Āhāra*-vagga*

* All *sutta*s in the Āhāra*-vagga* deal with pa*ṭiccasamuppāda*, the conditioned nature of things.
* They are set primarily in Sāvatthi and involve the Buddha addressing monks or answering their questions.
* Pairs of *sutta*s exhibit thematic connections, such as explaining right view or being a speaker on the Dhamma.

# Suttas 17 and 18

* Both suttas depict an ascetic asking the Buddha similar questions about suffering and pleasure.
* The Buddha responds "not so" to each question, explaining that these views are connected with eternalism or nihilism.
* He teaches the middle way of dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda) as the correct path.

# Suttas 19 and 20

* These suttas have a less obvious connection than the previous pair.
* Sutta 19 contrasts a fool with a wise man, highlighting ignorance and craving as key differences.
* Sutta 20 provides a fuller articulation of dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda) and its implications for understanding reality.

# Pātimokkha/Prātimokṣas

* Rules in the Pātimokkha/Prātimokṣas often form pairs or strings based on common subjects, keywords, or wording.
* This pattern is more widespread than previously acknowledged by scholars.
* The saṃghādisesa rules exemplify this pairing structure, with each pair sharing wording and increasing word count.

# Artificiality of Suttas

* Some sections of canonical collections, particularly the Saṃyutta-nikāya/Samyuktāgama and Aṅguttara-nikāya/Ekottarikāgama, exhibit an "artificial" quality.
* This is evident in the Nidāna-saṃyutta's Buddha-vagga and Samaṇabrāhmaṇa-vagga, where suttas seem to be created by splitting original discourses or applying the same wording repeatedly.

# Book of Ones

* The Book of Ones in the Aṅguttara-nikāya/Ekottarikāgama demonstrates this artificiality through the subdivision of logically larger sets into individual components.
* This suggests a desire to create a complete Book of Ones despite a lack of genuine single-item doctrinal sets.

# The Generation and Arrangement of Sutras

* Sutras in higher *nipāta*s were often created by combining sequences from lower *nipāta*s, adding comparable elements, or combining two sets of doctrinal items within a single sutra.
* The generation of sutras to create the Book of Ones and fill out other Books may have been motivated by a sense of balance and neatness, but in other sections, it seems more driven by a desire for comprehensive collections and repetition.

# Possible Motives for Repetition

* Competition with brahmans, other religious groups like Jains, or other Buddhist communities might have fueled the desire to produce large textual corpora.
* The repetitive nature of early Buddhist texts, from small units to larger sutras, suggests that repetition itself was desired rather than simply creating a large corpus.
* Memorizing and reciting repetitive material ensured accurate transmission and acted as a tool for mental training, concentration, and meditative exercise.

# Creation of New Sutras

* Canonical collections are not just arrangements of pre-existing sutras; new sutras were created for specific contexts to present teachings in particular orders or manners, develop themes, or portray the Buddha in certain ways.
* The Buddha's long preaching career likely involved repeated discourses on the same topic, tailored to different occasions and audiences.

# Arrangement and Transmission

* Sutras arranged in pairs indicate extensive culling and modification of discourses during collection creation.
* *Uddāna*s (mnemonic verses) controlled arrangement and transmission by referencing textual units through keywords or main topics.
* These mnemonic devices ensured inclusion, correct ordering, and memorization of collections.

# Para-textual Nature of Uddānas

* *Uddāna*s are para-textual and contextual entities, created and recreated as collections were rearranged.
* Differences in *uddāna*s for the same collection across different Theravāda communities highlight their adaptability.

# Conclusion

* The creation and organization of early Buddhist texts involved careful control, selection, culling, proliferation, standardization, and community ratification.
* The process was a massive undertaking requiring significant time, effort, and investment.
* The surviving texts suggest a deliberate and structured approach rather than spontaneous creativity or composition in performance.

# Texts: Their Origin, Function, and Importance

* References to memorized and recited texts are found in sutras and Vinaya.
* Terms like suttantika, āgatāgama, dhammadhara, vinayadhara, mātikādhara, dhammakathika, and bhāṇaka refer to experts in specific textual classes or forms of transmission.

# The Bhāṇakas: Reciters and Transmitters

* Early Buddhist texts were transmitted by communities of reciters called bhāṇakas.
* These communities specialized in particular collections of texts, such as the Dīgha-nikāya and Majjhima-nikāya.
* Evidence for bhāṇaka communities comes from commentaries, inscriptions, and Theravāda accounts.

# Differences Between Parallel Versions

* Parallel versions of early Buddhist texts exhibit a range of differences despite overall similarity.
* These differences include missing episodes, variations in sequence, arrangement, and wording, as well as changes in names, grammar, and textual organization.

# Factors Contributing to Textual Variation

* Language change, bhāṇaka traditions with differing views, teacher authority, geographical isolation, lack of centralized authority, formation of nikāyas, dynamic understanding of buddhavacana, emphasis on meaning over wording, mnemotechnical skills, influence between communities, oral performance variations, and the impact of writing all contributed to textual differences.

# Intentional and Unintentional Changes

* Textual changes could be intentional or unintentional.
* Unintentional changes might arise from memory limitations and social background.
* Intentional changes reflect a willingness to modify texts within Buddhist communities.

## What Forces Lead to the Insertion of New Material into Religious Texts?

* This question is approached from a Western perspective, assuming interpolation is intentional and creative.
* Evidence suggests this assumption is incorrect for many Buddhist scriptures.
* Unintentional interpolations are common in oral traditions.
* Examples include repetition, adding details, and recalling previously memorized passages.


## 5.2. Change Of Language

* Buddhists adapted language to suit their audience or monastic community.
* This is evident in the diversity of languages used for Buddhist texts: Pali, Gandhari, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, etc.
* The use of Pali in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, despite not being the local language, demonstrates this flexibility.

* Our understanding of early Buddhist languages is limited due to the scarcity of surviving literature.
* The origins and usage of Pali are still debated.
* Gandhari was prevalent in northwest India until around the 3rd or 4th century CE when Sanskrit became more common.

* Translation involved adapting phonology, morphology, syntax, meter, and sandhi.
* Examples from Pali, Gandhari, and Sanskrit versions of sutras demonstrate these changes.

* Sanskritization of Prakrit texts is evident in late Gandhari manuscripts.
* These manuscripts show a blend of Gandhari and Sanskrit orthography and morphology.
* This process involved replacing archaic or regional words with more common equivalents.

* Translating verse from Prakrit to Sanskrit often resulted in unmetrical text, leading translators to modify word order, synonyms, and even meaning.
* Examples from the *Dhammapada*, *Dharmapada*, Patna Dharmapada, and *Udānavarga* illustrate these variations.

# Pādas a–b:

* The Pali version is "dwelling contemplating pleasant things, being uncontrolled in the senses, not knowing moderation in food".
* Sanskrit equivalent of MIA subhānupassiṃ *viharanta*ṃ would be śubhānudarśinaṃ *viharanta*ṃ, which has ten syllables.
* The Sanskrit translator replaced *viharanta*ṃ with *nityam*, "always", resulting in "always contemplating pleasant things".

# Pādas c–d:

* MIA versions are virtually identical.
* Sanskrit equivalent of *pāda* c would be *bhojane 'mātrajñaṃ*, with six syllables.
* The translator inserted *ca + api* to avoid the elision of the initial vowel of a*mātrajñaṃ*.
* Sanskrit equivalent of *pāda* d would be kusīdaṃ *hīnavīryaṃ*, which has seven syllables.

# Pādas e–f:

* Gandhari and Sanskrit agree in reading G raku/Skt. *rāgo*, "lust", in contrast to *māro*, "Māra (the evil one)".
* Sanskrit equivalent of *pāda* f would be the unmetrical *vāto* vṛkṣam iva durbalam, with nine syllables.

# Dialectal Variation and Change:

* MIA versions differed primarily in phonology with some minor differences in morphology, syntax, and vocabulary.
* It may not have been difficult for a person to learn to recite texts in a different MIA dialect.
* Sanskrit, however, may have been more challenging due to its differences from the MIA dialects.

## 5.3. Modification Of The Wording

* This section discusses significant differences in wording across different versions of Buddhist texts, particularly focusing on the last words of the Buddha.

* The Pali version is concise, while the Sanskrit version is expanded, including a description of the Buddha exposing his body to illustrate impermanence.
* Both versions convey the same core message, but the Sanskrit version adds detail and emphasis. 
* This expansion may reflect an attempt to humanize the Buddha or to clarify the meaning for later audiences.

* The example of how monks show respect to the Buddha illustrates how wording can evolve across different versions.
* The Pali uses a general term (*abhivādetvā*), while Sanskrit specifies honoring the feet with the head (*bhagavataḥ pādau śirasā vanditvā*).
* This change likely aimed to clarify meaning and ensure consistency across texts.

* Another example involves the formula for requesting ordination.
* The Pali and Gandhari versions are similar, but the Sanskrit version is more elaborate, including references to "well-proclaimed teaching and discipline" (*svākhyāte dharmavinaye*) and living a holy life (*brahmacaryam*). 




# Expanded Wording in Buddhist Texts

* The text discusses instances where expanded wording found in one version of a Buddhist sutra appears in another sutra or text from a different tradition.
* An example is given from the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta/Mahāpari-nirvāṇa-*sūtra*, where the phrase "hearing with the divine ear" is present in the Sanskrit version but absent in the Pali version.

# Intentional Change and Elaboration 

* The inclusion of expanded wording, like the "hearing with the divine ear" phrase, may be intentional, driven by a desire to elaborate, clarify, or emphasize certain qualities.
* This tendency towards elaboration is more characteristic of Sanskrit versions compared to Pali versions.

# Structural Differences in Parallel Versions

* Comparisons of parallel versions often reveal differences not just in wording but also in structure, plot development, and the course of events.
* The introductory narrative portion of the Sāmaññaphala*-sutta*/ Śrāmaṇyaphala-*sūtra* is cited as an example where multiple versions exist with significant variations across Pali, Gandhari, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese translations.

# Versions of the Sāmaññaphala-sutta/Śrāmaṇyaphala-sūtra

* Six sutra versions and one Vinaya version of the Sāmaññaphala*-sutta*/ Śrāmaṇyaphala-*sūtra* are mentioned, originating from different schools and textual lineages.
* These versions are listed with their abbreviations and language affiliations: Pali, Gandhari, Sanskrit, Chinese (Dīrghāgama), Chinese (Ekottarikāgama), and Chinese (independent translation). 




## Vinaya Version

* The *Saṃghabhedavastu* of the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* contains a non-sutra version of the story.
    * This version is found in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese manuscripts.
    * The Sanskrit manuscript dates back to the 6th or 7th centuries CE.
    * Inclusion of this sutra in the *Ekottarikāgama* and *Saṃghabhedavastu* is likely secondary.

* This sutra depicts King Ajātasattu visiting the Buddha to inquire about the benefits of monastic life.
    * The story's background involves the king killing his father, Bimbisāra, a follower of the Buddha.
    * Elements like the king's lack of peace and fear on his way to see the Buddha highlight this context.

* Multiple versions of the sutra exist, with variations in details.
    * MacQueen (1988) and Meisig (1987a) provide detailed accounts of most versions.
    * The narrative generally follows a similar structure across versions.

* All versions begin with the Buddha residing in Jīvaka's mango grove with 1250 monks.
    * King Ajātaśatru, on a full moon night, seeks advice from his courtiers on how to spend the evening.
    * Suggestions include engaging in pleasurable activities, military exploits, or visiting rival teachers of the Buddha.

* Variations exist in the specific courtiers who offer suggestions and the order of their recommendations.
    * Some versions name the courtiers, while others remain unnamed.
    * The six rival teachers mentioned consistently include Pūraṇa Kassapa/Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta/Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, and others.

* Jīvaka, the court physician and a follower of the Buddha, is introduced in most versions.
    * The king asks Jīvaka for his opinion on whom to visit.
    * Jīvaka recommends visiting the Buddha.

* The king sets out to see the Buddha with an entourage, experiencing fear along the way.
    * He questions Jīvaka about the whereabouts of the monks and expresses concern about potential betrayal.
    * Upon seeing the serene monks, the king wishes his son Udāyi could be the same.

* The king finally reaches the Buddha and inquires about the fruits of monastic life.
    * This dialogue forms the main part of the sutra.




## Sbhv Ii 216.15–20

* A lady of the court speaks to King Ajātaśatru, Vaidehīputra.
* She suggests that the king should enjoy himself with sense pleasures provided by five strands of sense-pleasures.
* The speaker believes this is what the king should do.

## DĀ 435r7–v1

* A lady of the court speaks to King Ajātaśatru, Vaidehīputra.
* She suggests that the king should enjoy himself with music played only by women on the roof of his upper apartment.
* The speaker says this is what the king should do.

## Differences Between Sbhv Ii 216.15–20 and DĀ 435r7–v1

* **Speaker's wording:** SBhV uses "said," while DĀ uses "spoke thus."
* **Details of enjoyment:** SBhV mentions five strands of sense-pleasures, while DĀ specifies music played only by women on the roof.
* **Speaker's certainty:** SBhV uses "I think," while DĀ uses "I say."

## Stability in Doctrinal Passages

* Changes are more likely to occur in narrative portions of sutras.
* Doctrinal passages and words spoken by the Buddha tend to be more stable.

## An Example: The Anattalakkhaṇa-sutta

* This discourse articulates the not-self nature of the five aggregates.
* Many versions exist in various languages and schools.
* Sections B and E show considerable agreement in wording between parallel versions, demonstrating stability in doctrinal passages.

# P = G

* Seeing thus, monks, the well-taught, noble disciple is disgusted with forms, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. 
* Being disgusted, he is dispassionate; on account of dispassion, [his mind] is liberated; being liberated, there is the knowledge "[my mind] is liberated."
* He understands, "birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no further [being] than this."

# SBhV

* When, monks, the well-taught noble disciple sees these five aggregates affected by clinging as not-self and as not pertaining to self, (then) seeing thus, he clings to nothing in the world; not clinging, he is not troubled; not troubled, he himself attains Nirvāṇa.
* He understands, "birth for me is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, I know

#  

* The wording of the Sanskrit version that differs is found elsewhere in the Pali canon, while the wording of the Pali and Gandhari is found elsewhere in the canonical literature of the Sarvāstivādins and Mūlasarvāstivādins.
* The Mahāparinibbāna-sutta/Mahāparinirvāṇa-*sūtra*s provide many examples of both impressively stable passages that are presented as reports of what the Buddha said and yet others that exhibit important differences.

# Chapter Five 


* In all cases it occurs alone without an associated discourse.
* Corresponding to the event set in Veṇuyaṣṭikā in the Sanskrit (MPS § 3) and Ambalaṭṭhikā in the Pali, the Chinese *Dīrghāgama* parallels the Pali in stating that the Buddha spoke on morality, concentration, and understanding, the location being the Bamboo grove near Rājagṛha.
* The topic of the discourse given at this point in the first of the independent Chinese translations of the *Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra*, the Fo bannihuan jing (T 1 no. 5. p. 162a28–b16), is quite different from the others dealing with the four kinds of suffering, the eight precepts and "correct mind," while the second independent translation, the Ban nihuan jing (T 1 no. 6, pp. 177b5–c2), parallels the Sanskrit in depicting the Buddha giving a discourse on the four noble truths, though it is much expanded.
* Regarding the discourse given by the Buddha in Koṭigāma/Kuṭi-grāmaka (MPS § 8) in the remaining parallel versions, in the Chinese Dīrghāgama (T 1 no. 1, p. 13a3–8) the Buddha lists the four profound teachings: noble morality, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation, stating that they are difficult to understand and that it is on account of not understanding them that he and the monks had experienced birth and death for so long, concluding with verses summarizing these ideas.
* This seems to be a combination of elements from the statement on morality, concentration, and understanding and the discourse on not understanding the four noble truths.

* The discourse in the Fo bannihuan jing (T 1 no. 5, p. 163a14-20) once again differs from the others, though it does touch on the theme of overcoming lust, hate, and delusion and transcending rebirth, while the *Ban nihuan jing* (T 1 no. 6, p. 178b4–12) parallels the Sanskrit in only giving the brief statement on morality, concentration, and understanding.
* The discourse on not understanding the four noble truths is only recorded in Pali and Sanskrit sources, and probably others as well, in association with the Buddha's final journey, namely, in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta/Mahāparinirvāṇa-*sūtra*s, as an independent sutra in the Pali and Chinese Saṃyutta-nikāya/*Saṃyuktāgama*s, and as part of the narrative of the *Mahāvagga* of the Pali Vinaya, in the case of Pali at least.
* In other words, the Buddha is not recorded as having given this discourse earlier in his life.

* Similarly, the Pali iti-*sīla-samādhi-paññā* formula and its Sanskrit iti-śīla-samādhi-*prajñā* parallel only occur in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta/Mahāparinirvāṇa-*sūtra*s, with both the Pali Saṃyutta-n*ikāya* and Vinaya occurrences of the discourse on not understanding the four noble truths omitting it.
* This discourse and this iti-*sīlasamādhi-paññā* formula therefore seem to have been created by those who composed the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta/*Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra*s.



## [3.4]

* Suffering is a noble truth that has not been discovered or penetrated, causing the long round of rebirths.
* The arising of suffering is a noble truth that has not been discovered or penetrated, causing the long round of rebirths.
* The cessation of suffering is a noble truth that has not been discovered or penetrated, causing the long round of rebirths.
* The way leading to the cessation of suffering is a noble truth that has not been discovered or penetrated, causing the long round of rebirths.

## [3.5–6]

* Suffering (a noble truth) has been pierced and penetrated. 
* The arising of suffering (a noble truth) has been pierced and penetrated.
* The cessation of suffering (a noble truth) has been pierced and penetrated.
* The way leading to the cessation of suffering (a noble truth) has been pierced and penetrated.
* Craving for being is cut off, that which leads to rebirth is destroyed, and there is now no further being.

## [3.7]

* The Bhagavat said this. Having said this, the Sugata, the teacher, then further said this:

## [3.8–9]


* It is on account of not seeing the four noble truths as they really are that this long round has been wandered through by me and you.
* Those truths having been seen, that which leads to (renewed) being is done away with, the samsara of births is destroyed, and there is now no further being. 



# The iti-sīla-samādhi-paññā/iti-*śīla-samādhi-prajñā* Formula

* This formula is unique to the Pali canon's Mahāparinibbāna*sutta*.
* None of its component elements are found elsewhere in the Pali canon.
* The Sanskrit version differs from the Pali version, with most of its elements found elsewhere in the Pali canon and likely in Sanskrit sutra texts as well.

# The Formula in the Pali and Sanskrit Versions

* The Pali version emphasizes the interconnectedness of morality (sīla), concentration (samādhi), and understanding (paññā).
* It highlights the transformative power of these qualities, leading to liberation from taints (āsava) like sense desire, being, views, and ignorance.
* The Sanskrit version incorporates wording found in other sutras, particularly regarding a mind released from lust, hate, and delusion.

# Modifications in the Sanskrit Version

* The Sanskrit version attributes the formula directly to the Buddha, while the Pali version presents it as a summary of his teachings by the sutra narrator.
* This suggests that those responsible for the Sanskrit version modified the original wording, possibly due to its initial status as not being spoken by the Buddha.

# Importance of the Pātimokkha/Prātimokṣa Rules

* These rules are considered foundational in all Buddhist communities and were recited fortnightly at formal uposatha ceremonies.
* Their fixed, memorized nature and communal recitation highlight their significance and resistance to change.
* The second Saṅghādisesa/Saṃghātiśeṣa/Saṃghāvaśeṣa rule serves as an example for comparative analysis across different Indic versions.




## # Saṅghādisesa Rule

* This section discusses variations in wording across different versions of the Saṅghādisesa rule, which outlines offenses related to physical contact between monks and women.
* Variations include the use of terms like "touching," "caressing," and "secondary parts." 
* The Sanskrit versions sometimes offer more straightforward phrasing compared to the Pali version.

## # Differences Between Versions

* This section explores reasons for differences between Pātimokkha/Prātimokṣa versions.
* Anālayo suggests these variations are due to errors of memory, unintentional factors, and blurring of lines between source text and commentary.
* The author argues that many changes aimed to clarify the original meaning, drawing from authoritative commentaries.

## # Shortening of Formulas

* This section examines instances where important formulas in sutras have been shortened.
* One example is the formula stating the Buddha's location and address to monks, which appears at the beginning of many sutras.
* The Gandhari version often abbreviates this formula compared to Pali and Sanskrit versions.

## Abbreviation of Formulas in Buddhist Texts

* This section examines how formulas used to introduce and conclude sutras have been abbreviated over time.

* **Introduction Formula:**

    * The Pali version includes a formal exchange between the Buddha and monks ("Monks," "Venerable sir").
    * Gandhari versions often omit this exchange, suggesting an early stage of abbreviation.
    * Sanskrit versions completely omit the exchange, possibly due to manuscript abbreviations becoming standard. 

* **Conversion Formula:**

    * The Pali version uses a simile comparing the Buddha's teachings to uncovering what was hidden, showing the path to the lost, and bringing light to darkness.
    * Gandhari versions vary: G1 includes the simile, while G2 omits it.
    * Sanskrit versions lack the simile but include expansions like "as long as there is life" and "with faith."

* **Possible Reasons for Abbreviation:**

    * Manuscript transmission may have led to abbreviations becoming common.
    * Editorial decisions may have standardized these abbreviated forms across different Buddhist communities.


## Manuscript Transmission and Textual Changes

* The author suggests that some textual changes, like the simplification of formulas, might have originated in manuscript transmission.
* However, many differences between Pali, Gandhari, and Sanskrit versions likely occurred during oral transmission before writing became widespread.
* Variations within the Pali canon itself also support this idea.



# Differences Between Pali Nikayas

* The *Dīgha-nikāya* version of the Buddha's death includes a dialogue between Ānanda and Anuruddha about whether the Buddha has attained *parinibbāna*, while the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* version does not.
* The *Dīgha-nikāya* describes an earthquake and thunder at the moment of the Buddha's death, which is absent in the *Saṃyutta-nikāya*.
* There are minor differences in wording between the two versions, such as the use of "saññāvedayitanirodhasamāpattiyā vuṭṭhahitvā" in the *Dīgha-nikāya* and "saññāvedayitanirodhā vuṭṭhahitvā" in the *Saṃyutta-nikāya*.
* The order of verses spoken by Anuruddha and Ānanda after the Buddha's death is reversed in the two versions.

# Differences in Formulas Depicting Events

* There are different formulas used to depict the Buddha or a monk visiting an ascetic in the *Dīgha-*-Majjhima-*nikāya*s compared to the *Saṃyutta-* and Aṅguttara-*nikāya*s.
* The formula for Māra approaching the Buddha near the end of his life varies between the *Dīgha-nikāya*, *Udāna*, *Saṃyutta-nikāya*, and *Aṅguttara-nikāya*.

# Reasons for Differences

* These differences may be due to variations in the function and use of each collection.
* They could also be attributed to the tradition of bhāṇaka reciters, who might have introduced intentional variations to identify their community or monastic nikāya.


# Importance of Contextual Information

* Understanding the context of a text, such as its intended audience, purpose, and transmission history, is crucial for interpreting it accurately.
* Ideally, we should consider factors like the function of the text, the collection it belongs to, and the reasons behind its production and transmission.


# Rearranging Sutra and Verse Collections

* Different schools or textual communities often arrange sutras and verses differently within collections.
* This rearrangement is a defining characteristic of canonical collections and reflects the unique perspectives and practices of each community.

# Recent Scholarship on the Composition of early Buddhist Texts, and Initiating and Adapting to Change

* Early Buddhist sutra texts were designed for memorization and oral transmission.
* Despite a fixed text tradition, these texts underwent intentional and unintentional changes throughout history.
* This raises questions about how reciter communities adapted to these changes, accepted them, and implemented them.

#  The Composition of Early Buddhist Texts

* McGovern (2019) argues against the idea of early Buddhist texts being designed as fixed texts for verbatim transmission.
* He proposes that they were created in performance using fixed formulas and narrative frames within an improvisatory but conservative oral tradition.
* This is based on the differences seen between parallel versions of sutras, which he sees as snapshots of performances.

# Counterarguments to McGovern's View

* The author argues that evidence shows Buddhist communities composed and memorized fixed texts from an early period.
* While communities were willing to change wording and structure, meaning was prioritized over exact wording.
* The examples of texts we have are not frozen snapshots of oral performances but formal "editions" sanctioned by the community.

# Repetition in Sutras

* The author questions why there is such a high degree of repetition in sutras if they were improvised performances.
* This repetition would make for dull performances and suggests that these texts only make sense in the context of fixed text oral transmission.

# Regarding McGovern's Understanding of Formulas

* Formulas themselves are not more conservative than sutras.
* Even within Pali *sutta*s, there is variation in formulas used to depict the same event or idea.

# Another Factor to Consider

* In periods when separate *nikāya*s had formed and especially after Ashoka, the language of the texts may not have been readily understood by the general public.
* This suggests that innovations and changes were initiated within monasteries for the edification of monks and as a basis for retellings in public.

# The Buddhist Community and Textual Transmission

* The Buddhist community's reasons for composing and transmitting texts differed from those who performed oral epics, for whom oral theory was formulated.
* Buddhists had the Brahmanical tradition of transmitting fixed texts as their model, not the bardic tradition that produced Indian oral epics.

# Shulman's Perspective on Early Buddhist Texts

* Unlike McGovern, Shulman acknowledges the integral role of memorization in text transmission by Buddhist communities.
* He doesn't subscribe to the Parry-Lord model of improvisation as the dominant paradigm for Buddhist oral culture.
* Shulman proposes that new texts may have been composed using existing formulas, adapting them to suit the context or creating new ones.




## And

* Formulas are fundamental textual elements in early Buddhist textuality, not discourses as traditionally thought.
* Discourses are products of combining formulas in different ways.
* While new texts undoubtedly used pre-existing formulas, they don't make formulas the primary element; both formulas and plot/structure are essential.

## The Play of Formulas: Toward a Theory of Composition for the Early Discourses

* Rhys Davids proposed a chronology where simple doctrinal formulas precede full suttas.
* Shulman interprets this as formulas being primary units, but this is too narrow.
* Many formulas are not doctrinal and are context-bound, suggesting they arose from plot and purpose.

## Formulas: Beyond Memorization Aids

* Shulman argues formulas have poetic and aesthetic aspects, creating a compelling perception of the Buddha.
* This confuses wording with formula status; repetitive use makes wording a formula, regardless of its content.
* Early Buddhist prose is highly structured, even unique phrases can function as formulas due to their potential for reuse.

## Functions of Formulaic Diction

* Formulas aid composition and transmission of fixed texts.
* They impart solemnity, gravitas, and authority, making the material "religious."
* Formulas relay legitimacy, predictability, and induce certain states of mind.

## The Central Project of Early Buddhist Texts

* Shulman argues the central project is not historical accuracy but visualizing the Buddha as sublime.
* This is too limiting; early Buddhist texts do much more than visualize the Buddha.

## Changes in Transmitted Texts

* Senior reciters likely led changes, with consensus not required for authorization.
* Communities were conservative regarding texts, so adaptation was probably infrequent.
* Estimating the time frame for changes is difficult due to limited evidence.
* Based on manuscript dates, changes could have occurred over several centuries (4-8+).

# The Timing of Change in Early Buddhist Texts

* It is difficult to pinpoint when significant changes to early Buddhist texts ceased. 
* Some scholars suggest the writing down of the Pali canon in Sri Lanka (1st century BCE) as a turning point, while others propose the writing of commentaries on the four main *nikāya*s in the fifth century CE.

# The Gradual Nature of Change

* Many changes observed in early Buddhist texts appear to have been introduced gradually.
* This is evident when comparing Pali, Gandhari, and Sanskrit versions, where Gandhari often shows some but not all of the changes seen in Sanskrit. 
* This suggests that reciters adapted to change incrementally.

# The Impact on Reciters

* The impact of textual change would have been experienced by only one generation of reciters at a time.
* These reciters, already skilled in memorization and recitation, likely found adapting to new versions manageable. 
* Subsequent generations, unfamiliar with the pre-change version, faced the same challenge as any beginner learning a text.
