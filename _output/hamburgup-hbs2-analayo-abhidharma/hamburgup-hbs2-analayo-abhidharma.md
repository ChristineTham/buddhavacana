# Foreword

* The Hamburg Buddhist Studies series aims to share research on Buddhism with both academics and the wider public.
* This volume focuses on the origins of Abhidharma, a key aspect of Buddhist thought.
* Anālayo argues that Abhidharma is not simply characterized by lists and summaries but by a deeper mode of thinking that examines the constituents of phenomena meticulously.

# Introduction

* This book explores the beginnings of Abhidharma, complementing the author's previous work on the bodhisattva ideal.
* The study focuses on early discourses and avoids comprehensive coverage.
* The book is divided into four chapters: communal recitation of Dharma, wisdom through knowledge of elements, meditative analysis, and the path to awakening.




## Sources

* My main source materials are the early discourses in the four main Pāli *Nikāya*s and their parallels.
* This study is a result of my research into the early discourses.


## Acknowledgement

* I am indebted to many scholars for commenting on this work.
* I dedicate this book to Bhikkhu Bodhi for encouraging me to study the early discourses. 

# 1 Reciting The Dharma And The Functions Of Lists

* This chapter explores the oral dimension of Dharma transmission by studying communal recitation (*saṅgīti*) in relation to Abhidharma.
* It surveys Vinaya accounts of what was recited at the first *saṅgīti*.
* It examines *mātṛkā*s, succinct lists or summaries of teachings, such as the Sa*ṅgīti-sūtra*.
* It analyzes the "seven sets" (thirty-seven qualities conducive to awakening) and their relation to Abhidharma formation. 


## 1.1 The First Saṅgīti At Rājagṛha

* In ancient India, Dharma transmission relied on oral means, making communal recitation (saṅgīti) crucial for Buddhist monastic communities.

*  Saṅgīti served legal purposes by reciting the *prātimokṣa* (rules), fostering communal harmony and identity.
* The first saṅgīti at Rājagṛha after the Buddha's demise established canonical texts for various Buddhist schools.

* Different Vinayas vary in their descriptions of what was recited at this event, particularly regarding the inclusion of Abhidharma.

##  Abhidharma in Early Accounts

* The Mahāsāṅghika and Mahīśāsaka Vinayas mention the recitation of *Āgamas*, *Kṣudraka-piṭaka*, and Vinaya but not Abhidharma as a separate collection.
* The Theravāda Vinaya reports the recitation of five N*ikāya*s after the Vinaya, also omitting Abhidharma.

* The Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya uses "Abhidharma" to refer to nine *aṅgas* within the discourses, not a separate collection.
* The Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda Vinayas mention Abhidharma as distinct from discourses, suggesting its emergence as a separate category.

* The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya mentions an *Abhidharma-piṭaka*, potentially indicating a later addition to the account of the first saṅgīti.
* The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya explicitly reports the recitation of Abhidharma, detailing Mahākāśyapa's inquiry about its location and content.

## Mūlasarvāstivāda Account

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya doesn't mention Abhidharma but reports Mahākāśyapa reciting *mātṛkā*(s), succinct summaries that could serve as the basis for detailed expositions.
* This account might represent an intermediate stage where what later became Abhidharma was referred to as *mātṛkā*.

## 1.2 Mātṛkā And Abhidharma

* The Mahāgopālaka*-sutta* describes a monk who fails to approach learned monks for improving his understanding, highlighting the importance of learning from those knowledgeable in Dharma, Vinaya, and *mātṛkā*(s).
* A Saṃyukta-*āgama* parallel similarly depicts a monk lacking knowledge of discourses, Vinaya, and Abhidharma.

* The mention of *mātṛkā*(s) in the Mahāgopālaka*-sutta* corresponds to Abhidharma in the Saṃyukta-*āgama*, mirroring a similar situation in Vinayas where Mūlasarvāstivāda mentions *mātṛkā* while Dharmaguptaka and Sarvāstivāda mention Abhidharma.

* The association of *mātṛkā*s with Vinaya suggests an old tradition, possibly reflecting their importance for memorizing the prātimokṣa.
* Knowing *mātṛkā*s could be valuable for ritual purposes, especially for reciting the prātimokṣa in monastic dwellings.

* The basic function of *mātṛkā*s is not exclusive to Abhidharma but facilitates memorization and teaching in oral traditions.

* Lists are also found in Jain tradition and Brahminical *sūtra*s, indicating their use beyond Buddhism.
* Examples like the Sumerian King List and Egyptian Execration Texts demonstrate the ancient use of lists across cultures.

* Organizing texts by topic or numerically is a natural way for orally transmitted texts, not necessarily reflecting Abhidharma influence.

* The question-and-answer format, while influential in Abhidharma, is also found in other Buddhist texts like the *Parivāra* and discourses.
* Even non-Abhidharma texts like the Pārāyana*-vagga* use this format, demonstrating its broader application.




## 1.3 Summaries Of The Dharma

* A prominent instance of the use of *mātṛkā*s among the early discourses is the Sa*ṅgīti-sūtra*.
* Versions of this discourse are extant as follows: Dharmaguptaka tradition, Sarvāstivāda and/or Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, Theravāda tradition, uncertain school affiliation. 

* The parallel versions agree in introducing Śāriputra as the speaker of the discourse, who sets his presentation in contrast with the quarrelling that had reportedly broken out among the Jains after the death of their leader.
* The issue of contention was about the correct teachings, about the Dharma and Vinaya taught by the leader of the Jains. 

* The Saṅgīti-*sūtra* has a function similar to the recital of the *prātimokṣ*a for a monastic community.

* Adherence to these *mātṛkā*s, which have been publicly affirmed as correct through the sa*ṅgīti*, is seen as essential for the welfare of the community.
* This function corresponds to what according to the traditional account took place at the first sa*ṅgīti* at Rājagṛha, where communal recitation – this time of the whole of the Dharma and Vinaya, instead of only the respective *mātṛkā*s - served as a response to the gap left by the death of the teacher.

* The Saṅgīti-*sūtra* provides an extended list of mostly doctrinal items, arranged in numerical order from Ones to Tens.
* Although such formal presentation is a typical feature of Abhidharma texts, it needs to be kept in mind that this is simply a convenient manner of arrangement to facilitate ease of oral recall.

* The number of doctrinal terms found in a subsection also tends to vary between the parallel versions of the discourse.

* A feature found similarly in the parallel versions points to an attempt to facilitate precise oral recall, in that the sequence in which items are placed in these discourses within the subsections from Ones to Tens at times shows the employment of concatenation.
* The use of concatenation in oral transmission ensures that items to be memorized remain in the proper order.



# Summaries of the Dharma

- The Saṅgīti-sūtra presents a list of teachings grouped numerically (Ones to Tens), with variations between parallel versions indicating potential additions and losses during oral transmission.

- The Daśottara-sūtra offers a more structured approach, consistently featuring ten items per numerical category, following a fixed sequence.

- The Arthavistara-sūtra adopts a thematic arrangement, building towards liberation and freedom from rebirth.

# Summaries in the Dharmaguptaka Dīrgha-āgama

- Two additional discourses attributed to the Buddha summarize the Dharma: "Increasing by One" (fivefold scheme) and "On the Three Groups" (threefold scheme).

- Both appear inspired by the Daśottara-sūtra, with "Increasing by One" being a shortened version and "On the Three Groups" focusing on destinies and Nirvāṇa.

# Summaries in the Madhyama-āgama

- The "Discourse on Explaining the Spheres" exemplifies how summaries build upon foundational concepts.
- It starts with the five aggregates, followed by detailed breakdowns of sense experiences (Sixes), leading to six elements and twelve links of dependent arising.

-  The discourse then shifts to Fours (meditative practices, noble truths, etc.), followed by Fives (perceptions ripening in liberation, spheres of liberation, faculties, powers, elements of release).

# Lists in Early Buddhist Discourses

*  Lists are prominent features of early Buddhist discourses.
* Some lists appear to be expanded versions of shorter lists found elsewhere.

# The "Discourse on Explaining the Spheres"

* Presents a list of thirty-one topics that should be taught to junior monks.
* Aims to ensure these monks will continue practicing Buddhism throughout their lives.
* Many of these topics reappear as chapter headings in the *Dharmaskandha*, an early Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma work.

# Combining Lists: The Last Discourse in the Madhyama-*āgama*

* Combines different lists by relating them to each other.
* Uses the example of abandoning ignorance, connecting it to various practices and Buddhist concepts.
* Extends this approach to all twelve links of dependent arising.

# Relationship Between Discourses and Abhidharma

* While some discourses share similarities with Abhidharma texts in terms of structure and content, they are not necessarily expressions of Abhidharma thought.
* The Sa*ṅgīti-sūtra*, though closely related to the canonical Abhidharma work *Sa*ṅgītiparyāya*, appears to be a compilation of material from various discourses.

# Visual Representation: Relief Depicting the Buddha's Passing

* A relief sculpture vividly portrays the grief felt by disciples upon the Buddha's death.
* Contrasts with an image of the living Buddha teaching, highlighting the sense of loss experienced by his followers.

## 1.4 The Seven Sets

* This section discusses seven sets of mental qualities and practices related to awakening found in various Buddhist scriptures.
* These sets include:
    - Four establishments of mindfulness
    - Four right efforts
    - Four bases for supernormal ability
    - Five faculties
    - Five powers
    - Seven factors of awakening
    - Noble eightfold path

* The seven sets are considered crucial for progress to awakening and ensuring communal harmony.
* Although the five faculties and five powers overlap, both sets are included in the list.

## 2 Wisdom And Early Canonical Abhidharma

* This section examines a list of elements from the *Bahudhātuka-sūtra* that contribute to wisdom cultivation.
* It explores early references to the term "abhidharma" and the nature of early canonical Abhidharma texts.
* The chapter aims to demonstrate how passages in early discourses were expanded upon and highlight the commentarial nature of early canonical Abhidharma texts. 




## 2.1 Wisdom And The Elements

* The stele shows the Buddha performing the twin miracle, which requires the simultaneous manifestation of fire and water emerging from different parts of one's own body, an expression of complete mastery over these material elements.

* Less emphasis on the material aspect of existence is evident in another recurrent analysis of elements in relation to the senses.

* The eighteen elements related to sense-experience and the six elements covering matter and consciousness appear at the outset of a detailed survey of various elements in the *Bahudhātuka-sūtra*.
* This discourse is extant in versions from different Buddhist schools: Mūlasarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda, Theravāda, and one of uncertain school affiliation.

* The main topic of the *Bahudhātuka-sūtra* is wisdom, a topic broached by contrasting a fool or foolishness with a wise one or being wise.
* The discourse quotation found in the twentieth chapter of the *Dharmaskandha* is used to illustrate the knowledge of elements that leads to wisdom.

* The Buddha lists various sets of elements: eighteen related to senses, six material elements, six mental elements, etc., totaling sixty-two elements. 

* Variations exist between versions of the discourse in terms of the number of elements listed.
* The Theravāda version has the shortest list (forty-one elements), while the Mūlasarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda versions have the longest (sixty-two).

* These variations are likely due to textual expansion rather than intentional omission or loss of text.




# The Expansion of the List of Elements in the Bahudhātuka-sūtra

* The most probable explanation for the differences in the list of elements is a gradual expansion during oral transmission.
* This expansion likely occurred because reciters added elements they considered relevant to the theme of wisdom.

# An Indicator of Expansion: The Group of Six Elements

* The inclusion of ignorance as part of the group of six elements (pleasure, pain, joy, sadness, equanimity) seems out of place.
* This suggests that the list may have been expanded from a shorter version.

# The Full Set of Sixty-Two Elements in the Dharmaskandha

* The sixty-two elements found in the *Dharmaskandha* clearly result from amplification.
* The *Dharmaskandha* also includes the five aggregates as a fifth topic, which is not present in other versions.

# The Addition of the Five Aggregates

* The addition of the five aggregates to the discourse quotations is likely a later development.
* This addition reflects a tendency towards comprehensiveness in discussions of wisdom.

# The Evolution of the Fourth Aggregate

* In later Abhidharma texts, the fourth aggregate (formations) becomes an umbrella category for various items that don't fit into other aggregates.
* This differs from its original meaning as volitional formations and obscures its function as a pointer to clinging to willpower and decision-making.

# The Tendency Towards Expansion in Early Buddhist Texts

* The case of the *Bahudhātuka-sūtra* exemplifies a general tendency towards expansion in early Buddhist texts.
* This expansion aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of wisdom by combining various teachings into a single coherent whole.

## 2.2 The Term Abhidharma

* In early Buddhist discourses, "*abhidharma*" initially appears related to "Dharma," suggesting interchangeability and meaning "about" or "concerning" Dharma.
* Later understanding associates *abhi-* with superiority, reflected in commentaries using "*abhidharma*" to authenticate the *Abhidharma-piṭaka*.

*  "*Abhidharma*" often appears alongside "*abhivinaya*", suggesting a shared meaning of detailed exposition about Dharma and Vinaya. 
* This usage implies a textual collection developing from discussions "about Dharma" into Abhidharma proper.

* Chinese *Āgama* discourses sometimes include "Abhidharma" where Pāli parallels lack it, indicating a later development.
* Examples include criteria for evaluating texts' authenticity and principles to be respected by monks regarding nuns' questions. 

* Some Madhyama-*āgama* discourses mention "Abhidharma" in contexts not typically associated with it, like discussions on cessation or poetic expositions.
* These instances might reflect commentarial influence becoming part of the discourse itself.

## # The Meaning of *Abhidharma*

* In early Buddhist discourses, *abhidharma* seems to mean simply "about" the Dharma.
* This sense is similar to the definition in the Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya, where it refers to all nine *aṅgas* of the Buddha's teaching.
* Early discourses show an increasing use and popularity of the term *abhidharma*, reflecting its associations among reciters.

## # 2.3 Canonical Commentary

* The tradition of accompanying discourses with commentaries dates back to early Buddhism.
* Commentaries provide additional information about the circumstances surrounding a teaching or offer exegesis.
* During oral transmission, historically-oriented commentaries remain closely connected to the discourse they comment on.
* Exegetical commentaries can become independent from the discourse they originally commented on.

* This is illustrated by examples from the *Sutta-piṭaka*, such as the Aṭṭ*hakavagga* and the *Udāna*. 
* The Sundarī tale, found in different texts, shows how commentarial material can acquire canonical status in various ways.
* In Vinaya literature, rules are embedded in a prose commentary (*vibhaṅga*), highlighting the tendency of commentaries to become part of the text.

* This pattern is also evident in the development of the Abhidharma-piṭaka*.
* The combination of *mātṛkā*s (summary lists) with commentaries is characteristic of both Abhidharma and Vinaya literature.
* The term *vibhaṅga*, used for a chapter in the Madhyama-*āgama* and Majjhima-*nikāya*, indicates a shared analytical mode of presentation with Abhidharma, but these discourses are not considered Abhidharma texts themselves.

* Examples like the Cūlakammavibhaṅga-sutta*, which explains karma and its fruit, demonstrate that not all *vibhaṅga* discourses are related to Abhidharma.

#  2.4 Early Canonical Abhidharma

* The *Bahudhātuka-sūtra* and *Dharmaskandha* are examples of early canonical Abhidharma works closely tied to early Buddhist discourses.
* Both works use discourse quotations followed by exegesis, highlighting their connection to the discourses.
* They are attributed to chief disciples and likely represent an early stage in Abhidharma thought development.

# 3 Meditative Analysis And Omniscience

* This chapter explores the relationship between analysis and meditation practice, focusing on two meditation topics: the four noble truths and absorption.
* It examines the Buddha's awakening through his cultivation of absorption and realization of the four noble truths.
* The chapter analyzes the tendency for analysis to expand in early discourses, leading to new formulations and terms characteristic of Abhidharma texts. 




## 3.1 The Analysis Of The Four Noble Truths

* The Smṛtyupasthāna-sūtra presents mindfulness exercises covering contemplation of the body, feelings, mental states, and dharmas.
* Different versions exist in various Buddhist traditions (Sarvāstivāda, Theravāda) with variations in content, especially regarding contemplation of dharmas.

* The Ekottarika-*āgama* version focuses on awakening factors and absorptions.
* The Madhyama-*āgama* adds sense-spheres and hindrances. 
* The Dīgha-nikāya and Majjhima-*nikāya* versions include additional exercises: aggregates, four noble truths.

* Contemplation of the four noble truths may be a later addition in the Dīgha-nikāya and Majjhima-*nikāya*, as it's absent in Chinese *Āgama* parallels and some Theravāda texts.
* The inclusion of the four noble truths aligns with their significance in Buddhist tradition, likely added to encompass all relevant doctrinal items under "dharmas."

##  Analysis of Contemplation of Four Noble Truths

* The Mahāvibhāṣā suggests that all phenomena are included within the four smṛtyupasthāna*s*, while the Śāriputrābhidharma proposes that the fourth smṛtyupasthāna covers anything not covered by the first three.
* This evolution reflects a drive towards comprehensive coverage of relevant items in Abhidharma traditions.

* The Satipaṭṭhāna*-sutta provides brief instructions on contemplating the four noble truths, while the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta offers detailed exegesis.

* The Saccavibhaṅga-sutta also analyzes the first and fourth truths with word-by-word explanations, suggesting later developments compared to earlier, summary presentations of the four noble truths.
* Comparative study reveals variations in these explanations across different versions, indicating a process of textual evolution.

# In the world craving for forms … in the world craving for sounds … in the world craving for odours … in the world craving for tastes … in the world craving for tangibles … in the world craving for mental objects is of a pleasing nature and an agreeable nature; when arising, it is there that this craving arises; when establishing itself, it is there that it establishes itself. 

* Craving arises and establishes itself in relation to:
    * Forms
    * Sounds
    * Odours
    * Tastes
    * Tangibles
    * Mental objects

# In the world thought of forms … in the world thought of sounds … in the world thought of odours … in the world thought of tastes … in the world thought of tangibles … in the world thought of mental objects is of a pleasing nature and an agreeable nature; when arising, it is there that this craving arises; when establishing itself, it is there that it establishes itself.

* Craving arises and establishes itself in relation to:
    * Thoughts of forms
    * Thoughts of sounds
    * Thoughts of odours
    * Thoughts of tastes
    * Thoughts of tangibles
    * Thoughts of mental objects

# In the world pondering on forms … in the world pondering on sounds … in the world pondering on odours … in the world pondering on tastes … in the world pondering on tangibles … in the world pondering on mental objects is of a pleasing nature and an agreeable nature; when arising, it is there that this craving arises; when establishing itself, it is there that it establishes itself.

* Craving arises and establishes itself in relation to:
    * Pondering on forms
    * Pondering on sounds
    * Pondering on odours
    * Pondering on tastes
    * Pondering on tangibles
    * Pondering on mental objects 


# Monks, this is called the noble truth of the arising of *dukkha*.

* This detailed analysis of craving's arising is unique to the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta*.
* The exposition aims to cover all possible ways craving might arise.

# From the practical perspective of mindfulness training it makes sense to explain that craving for what is pleasing and agreeable can arise and establish itself in relation to each of the six senses (1) and the corresponding objects (2), or to consciousness (3) representing the mental experience of the sensory input. Once this much has been covered in mindfulness practice, however, it seems of less practical relevance to continue making the same point again and again as done in the Mahā-satipaṭṭhāna*-sutta*, directing mindfulness also to the fact that craving may arise in relation to the following aspects: 4) contact, 5) feeling, 6) perception, 7) volition, 8) craving, 9) thought, 10) pondering. Stages (1) to (3) correspond to the standard presentation of the eighteen elements: the six senses, their six objects, and the six corresponding types of consciousness. Stages (4) to (7) appear to complement consciousness (3) with the remaining four aggregates, if contact (4) can be taken to represent the first aggregate of bodily form. Then follow craving (8), thought (9) and pondering (10).

* Mindfulness practice should focus on craving arising from senses, objects, and consciousness.
* The Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta* extends this to include contact, feeling, perception, volition, craving, thought, and pondering.


# Particularly notable is that with stage (8) the exposition proposes that craving arises and becomes established in relation to craving. From a practical perspective, I find it difficult to conceive of a meaningful form of mindfulness practice that contemplates this particular mode of the arising of craving.

* It's hard to imagine a practical mindfulness exercise focused on craving arising from craving itself. 


# Several scholars have already pointed out that the more detailed exposition of the four noble truths in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta* appears to be an intrusion of commentarial exegesis into the discourse. This detailed exegesis recurs in the *Saccavibhaṅga* of the *Vibhaṅga*.

* The detailed analysis of craving might be later commentary added to the original discourse.





## 3.2 The Analysis Of Absorption

* The *Anupada-sutta* describes Sāriputta's contemplation of mental factors within each of the four absorptions and the first three immaterial spheres.
* It not only considers absorption-specific factors but also lists those invariably present during any absorption.
* An analysis of the first absorption reveals a unique detailed description absent in other Pali discourses.

* The list of mental factors specific to each absorption uses the conjunction "and" (ca), while the remainder does not, suggesting two independent lists combined.
* The expression "one by one determination," found only in later texts, further supports this theory.
* Internal inconsistencies like duplicated terms within descriptions of the same *dhyāna* also point towards later additions.

* Redundancies in listing mental factors (e.g., equipoise and mindfulness twice in the third absorption) suggest an Abhidharma influence.
* The *Anupada-sutta*'s description contrasts with early canonical Abhidharma texts, which only analyze absorption-specific factors.
* The *Vibhaṅga* provides descriptions of the first and third absorptions focusing on key characteristics like seclusion from hindrances and the absence of rapture.

* Awareness of these central aspects is crucial for practical development of tranquillity and insight.
* The later addition to the *Anupada-sutta* lists factors invariably present in all absorptions, shifting focus from practical concerns to a more general analysis characteristic of Abhidharma taxonomy.

* This shift reflects the tendency of analysis to gain value in itself, exemplified by attributing this detailed analytical approach to Sāriputta, revered for his wisdom.
* The *Anupada-sutta* demonstrates the prominence of Abhidharma presentation and its emphasis on exhaustive analysis.

## # The Buddha'S Awakening

* According to early discourses, attaining absorptions and insight into the four noble truths were central to the Buddha's path to awakening.
* This reflects their significance in early Buddhist tradition.
* The *Upakkilesa-sutta* describes the Buddha's pre-awakening cultivation of absorption, focusing on the role of *vitarka* and *vicāra*.

* It presents three stages: with both *vitarka* and *vicāra*, without *vitarka* but with *vicāra*, and without both.
* The more common presentation using four absorptions emphasizes affective tone and provides a detailed description of each level.

* This perspective doesn't account for the stage where *vitarka* is gone but *vicāra* remains, as it falls under the category of rapture and happiness related to seclusion.
* These two modes of describing absorption experience are complementary analyses of the same process.

* An Aṅguttara-*nikāya* discourse describes the Buddha's cultivation of absorptions using the fourfold scheme, indicating gradual progress over time.

* The description confirms that basic awareness of factors specific to each absorption was considered sufficient for practical purposes.
* This differs from the detailed scrutiny in the *Anupada-sutta*.

## # Turning From Absorption To The Four Noble Truths

* The four noble truths feature prominently in the Buddha's first teaching after awakening.
* According to different versions, he announced something new and unheard of.
* This suggests that his realization couldn't be couched in standard formulations.

* The basic teaching of the four noble truths functions as a form of analysis, similar to medical diagnosis:
    * Disease: *duḥkha*
    * Pathogen: craving
    * Health: Nirvāṇa
    * Cure: eightfold path

* Some early discourses compare the four noble truths to medical diagnosis.

* The use of this scheme as a conceptual tool for conveying the Buddha's awakening needs to be understood in its context.
* The attainment of Nirvāṇa corresponds to the third truth, the cessation of *duḥkha*.

* The success of the medical analogy is reflected in the narrative of the first teaching, where one disciple attained streamentry upon hearing it.
* This suggests that this basic analysis was considered sufficient for practical purposes.



## # Contrast And Trajectory


* The depiction of the Buddha's attainment contrasts with the detailed analyses in the *Anupada-sutta* and Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta*.

* Even for reaching omniscience, a relatively simple analysis appears to have been considered sufficient.
* Placing these descriptions together reveals a trajectory from a basic approach to detailed analyses concerned with minute details.

* While early Abhidharma analysis takes off from practical concerns, it tends towards analysis for its own sake.
* This is due to the attempt to be as detailed and comprehensive as possible.

## 3.4 The Buddha And Omniscience

* Early Buddhist thought suggests awakening for an arhat doesn't require omniscience.
* Some texts suggest the Buddha had penetrative insight into all aspects of experience, which could be interpreted as a claim to omniscience.
* The Pāli commentary on the Aṅguttara-*nikāya* interprets this as meaning the Buddha knew everything seen, heard, etc., by all beings.

* Another Pāli discourse explicitly denies the Buddha ever claimed omniscience.
* Some discourses state no recluse or Brahmin has omniscient knowledge at once.
* An Ekottarika-*āgama* discourse claims the Buddha understood past, present, and future.
* A Madhyama-*āgama* discourse attributes omniscience to the Buddha through his teacher Urubilvā Kāśyapa.

* The *Kathāvatthu* states the Buddha was omniscient, and commentaries refer to him as an "omniscient bodhisattva" even before awakening.
* Omniscient knowledge of the future conflicts with early Buddhist doctrine of conditionality, which suggests the future is conditioned but not predetermined.
* Vinaya narrations show the Buddha changed rules due to unforeseen problems, suggesting he didn't have complete knowledge of the future.

* The *Sandaka-sutta* criticizes teachers claiming omniscience who face difficulties explaining misfortunes they encounter.
* This criticism suggests the Buddha wasn't considered omniscient when this discourse was written.

* Over time, the Buddha likely came to be attributed with omniscient knowledge, possibly due to competition with other groups like the Jains, whose leader was believed to be omniscient.
* The Abhidharma, with its comprehensive coverage of all facts and details, reflects a similar tendency towards completeness as the notion of the Buddha's omniscience.

* The *Atthasālinī* identifies the Abhidharma with omniscient knowledge and considers rejecting it a cause for schism.
* Both the idea of the Buddha's omniscience and the Abhidharma provide a sense of security and completeness.




# 4 Awakening And The Authentication Of The Abhidharma

* This chapter explores the concept of the supramundane path in early Buddhist thought, focusing on the Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta*.
* It examines how both the Abhidharma and Mahāyāna traditions sought to be recognized as authentic records of the Buddha's teachings.
* The chapter also investigates the story about the Buddha teaching the Abhidharma to his mother in the Heaven of the Thirty-three.

## 4.1 The Supramundane Path

* In early Buddhism, the noble eightfold path is considered the path to awakening.
* The Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta*, found in different versions across Buddhist schools, explores the relationship between the eightfold path and stages of awakening.
* This discourse defines right concentration as one-pointedness supported by other path factors.
* It emphasizes the role of right view in differentiating between right and wrong path factors, aided by right effort and mindfulness.

* The Pāli version uniquely distinguishes between wrong, mundane right, and supramundane right path factors.
* This threefold exposition highlights a distinction between mundane wholesome actions and those leading to awakening.
* The Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta*'s use of terms like "mental absorbing" and "mental inclination" aligns with Abhidharma terminology.

* The discourse's description of supramundane path factors as "factors of the path" reflects an Abhidharma perspective, focusing on the moment of awakening rather than a prolonged practice period.
* This viewpoint contrasts with the usual understanding of "without influxes" in discourses, which refers to the state of an arhat.
* The Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta*'s emphasis on mental activities present during awakening further highlights its Abhidharma influence.

# The Perceived Importance of the Supramundane Path

* A discussion on the nature of the supramundane path highlights its significance.
* Monks were expected to know the "great forty" (Mahācattārīsaka), a discourse likely containing this description.

# The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta and Supramundane Path Factors

* The Mahācattārīsaka-sutta's main intent is to show how other path factors support right concentration.
* It doesn't explicitly aim to describe each path factor individually, focusing instead on their interrelation.
* Parallel versions of the discourse lack a description of supramundane path factors, suggesting it was a later addition.

# The Saṃyukta-āgama and Supramundane Path Factors

* A similar presentation of supramundane path factors is found in the Saṃyukta-āgama (Chinese translation).
* It describes both mundane and supramundane versions of right intention, speech, action, and livelihood.
* Unlike the Mahācattārīsaka-sutta, it emphasizes the perspective of the four noble truths.

# The Dīrgha-āgama and the Three Groups

* The "Discourse on the Three Groups" in the Dīrgha-āgama (Chinese translation) distinguishes between path factors leading to bad destiny, good destiny, and Nirvāṇa.
* It presents a three-part structure: wrong path factors, mundane right path factors, and noble right path factors.

# Early Abhidharma Analysis

* The concern with distinguishing between mundane and supramundane path factors is found across different Buddhist traditions (Dharmaguptaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Theravāda).
* This indicates that early Abhidharma analysis originated in meditation practice and experience.
* The focus on the supramundane path aims to understand the essence of Dharma practice and the experience of awakening.

## 4.2 The Path To Awakening

- The experience of awakening can occur at four levels: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and arhatship.
- Each level corresponds to the abandonment of specific fetters.
- Early discourses distinguish between those on the path to these levels and those who have reached them.

## 

- The path to awakening is often compared to a journey with an extended time period.
- Developed Abhidharma views the path as a single moment before awakening.
- This shift is illustrated by the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅ*ga-sutta* and its commentary.

##  

- The Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta* exhibits mature early Abhidharma thought, particularly in its description of the supramundane path.
- Other discourses like the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta* and *Anupada-sutta* also show Abhidharma influence.

## 

- Early stages of Abhidharma development are evident in the discourses before becoming a distinct genre.
- Abhidharma eventually overshadowed the discourses as the central reference point.




## 4.3 The Need For Authentication

* Several discourses spoken by disciples conclude with an endorsement by the Buddha, stating that he would have explained the matter in the same way. This gave those expositions canonical status and made them part of the "word of the Buddha".
* Even without explicit approval from the Buddha, explanations and comments made by disciples became canonical discourses.

* A discourse in the Aṅguttara-ni*kāya* reports that Śakra, the ruler of the *deva*s, descended to earth to find out if a teaching delivered by the monk Uttara had originally been spoken by the Buddha.
* Uttara states that "whatever is well said is all the word of that Blessed One", indicating that anything well-said could be considered the word of the Buddha.

* The discourse suggests that memory of a teaching given by the Buddha can be lost among humans but preserved in Heaven.

* The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* proclaims "whatever is well said is all the Buddha's word", a statement important for authenticating Mahāyāna texts.
* Rejecting what should be considered the word of the Buddha is believed to lead to rebirth in hell, as is being schismatic.

* Both upholders of the Abhidharma and of the Mahāyāna sought to establish the authenticity of their respective texts.
* They shared a sense of superiority vis-àvis the early teachings.
* The early discourses were considered "inferior" (*hīna*), while the teachings of the Abhidharma were considered "superior" (*abhi-*).

* This led to the formation of independent textual collections, the Abhidharma-piṭaka and the *Bodhisattva-piṭaka*, considered superior to the early discourses.
* Both traditions gave rise to texts in the form of *dhāraṇī*s.

* The Abhidharmakośabhāṣ*ya states that the Buddha explicitly stated that his teachings cannot be understood without relying on the Abhidharma.
* In the Theravāda tradition, those who have mastered the Abhidharma are given a higher share of offerings than those who have mastered the Vinaya or the discourses.

* The *Sumaṅgalavilāsinī* commentary gives pride of place to the Abhidharma-piṭaka in its description of the gradual decline of the Buddha's dispensation (*sāsana*).
* It reports that the recitation of the Abhidharma-piṭaka was followed by an earthquake, marking it as an important event.

* Chief disciples like Śāriputra played a central role in early canonical Abhidharma texts and are depicted as faithful disciples of the Mahāyāna.

* The *Atthasālinī* reports that the textual order of the Theravāda Abhidharma was devised by Śāriputra.
* In the case of the *Kathāvatthu*, tradition reports that this treatise was delivered by Moggaliputtatissa at the time of King Aśoka, but the *Atthasālinī* argues that all seven texts of the Theravāda Abhidharma collection should be considered the word of the Buddha.

* The Sarvāstivāda tradition also considers the Abhidharma to be the word of the Buddha, with works like the Abhidharmakośa-*bhāṣ*ya and the **Mahāvibhāṣā* reporting that the Buddha had given Abhidharma teachings on various occasions.
* The difference between the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda traditions in attributing authorship is less pronounced than one might think, given explicit authorship attributions of works like the Saṅgītiparyāya and the *Dharmaskandha* to chief disciples.

* A problem arises when considering the account of the first sa*ṅgīti* at Rājagṛha, as several canonical Vinayas do not mention a recitation of an Abhidharma collection or Mahāyāna texts at this time.

## # 4.4 The Buddha In The Heaven Of The Thirty-Three

* This tale is found in various Buddhist sources, including canonical texts from different schools and Theravāda commentaries.
* The Saṃyukta-*āgama* reports that the Buddha spent a rains retreat teaching Dharma to his mother and devas in the Heaven of the Thirty-three.
* Humans requested the Buddha's return as they couldn't visit him in heaven, while devas could easily do so.

## # The Buddha's Descent from Heaven

* Most textual versions and artistic depictions focus on the Buddha's descent from the Heaven of the Thirty-three.
* Iconography often portrays stairs used by the Buddha for his descent, flanked by Brahmā and Śakra. 
* Some accounts mention footsteps on the stairs, suggesting a literal interpretation.

## # The Stairs as a Symbol

* The motif of stairs likely originated in aniconic art to symbolize the Buddha's descent.
* Textual accounts seem to struggle with the use of stairs, requiring explanations for this seemingly mundane method of descent.
* The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya suggests the Buddha chose stairs to avoid misinterpretations about his supernatural powers.

## # Cross-Fertilization between Text and Art

* The stairs motif likely originated in art and was later incorporated into textual accounts, demonstrating a cross-fertilization between the two mediums.
* The Saṃyukta-*āgama* discourse offers an earlier version of the tale with less emphasis on the descent details.
* Later versions, influenced by art, elaborate on the stairs and the Buddha's journey back to earth.

## # The Abhidharma Transmission

* The Theravāda tradition uniquely associates the Heaven of the Thirty-three with the transmission of the Abhidharma.
* According to the *Atthasālinī*, the Buddha taught the Abhidharma to his mother in heaven and then transmitted it to Sāriputta on earth.
* This narrative explains how the Abhidharma reached the human world despite being initially taught in a celestial realm.

# Conclusion

* Approaching the evolution of Abhidharma from the perspective of early discourses helps understand the relationship between early canonical Abhidharma works and specific discourses.
* The fact that a commentary on the Saṅgīti-sūtra became a canonical Abhidharma work doesn't automatically make the Saṅgīti-sūtra proto-Abhidharma.

* Early Abhidharma texts were essentially commentaries on discourses, becoming increasingly independent over time.
* What was initially "about" Dharma evolved into the "superior" or "higher" Dharma, the Abhidharma.

* Canonical Abhidharma works reflect the influence of *mātṛkā*s (summary listings) and question-and-answer catechisms, but these are not exclusive to Abhidharma.
* Topic-wise and numerical arrangements in collections like Saṃyukta-āgama/Saṃyutta-*nikāya* and Ekottarika-āgama/Aṅgutta-ra-*nikāya* are natural organizing structures for orally transmitted material.

* The dawn of Abhidharma was inspired by a shift in perspective towards comprehensiveness, aiming to provide a complete map of the path.
* This drive mirrors the Buddha's omniscient knowledge and provides disciples with all necessary information even after his passing.


* The elevation of the Buddha to an omniscient teacher and the mapping of doctrine in Abhidharma are interdependent processes responding to disciples' needs and contemporary ideas.

* Doctrinal and textual proliferation is evident in variations between parallel versions of the Saṅgīti-sūtra, reflecting a tendency to add items while still using material from early discourses.
* Detailed analyses of the four noble truths and absorptions in Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna*-sutta* and *Anupada-sutta* show increased proliferation and use of specific terminology, marking an early stage of Abhidharma development.

* The focus on momentary events in these discourses is a natural outcome of trying to provide complete coverage.
* The Mahācattārīsaka*-sutta* represents a more mature stage of Abhidharma thought, focusing on a momentary event and illuminating the crucial concern of awakening.




# The Dawn of Abhidharma

* The notion of the supramundane path is important in early Buddhism and comparable to the idea that Gautama was supreme from birth and decided to seek Buddhahood in a past life.
* This gradual apotheosis of the Buddha led to the emergence of the bodhisattva ideal, mirrored by the concept of his omniscience, which reflects the Abhidharma's drive for comprehensiveness.

# The Superiority of the Buddha and the Abhidharma

* The Theravāda tale of the Buddha teaching his mother the Abhidharma in heaven expresses how the Buddha's superiority informs the supremacy of the Abhidharma.
* This story aims to authenticate the Abhidharma as an independent set of scriptures.

# What is Abhidharma?

* Abhidharma goes "further" than the Dharma, evident in new terminology and ideas born out of a commentary on the Dharma.
* It arose from the wish to clarify the Buddha's teachings after his death.
* Abhidharma aims at complete coverage by surveying all constituents of a single moment in their interrelation, rather than merely monitoring disenchantment, dispassion, and seeing as it really is.
