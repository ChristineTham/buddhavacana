* Globalization has impacted most areas of life and culture, but its effect on Buddhism in Sri Lanka seems negligible.
* Sinhalese Buddhism has become more inward-looking due to the civil war, strengthening chauvinistic and xenophobic strands.
* Globalization's influence is noticeable in the ordination of women to re-establish the Order of Nuns, but chauvinist opinion hinders progress.



## A. Introductory Information

* Buddhists consider their religion has Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma (Truth/Law), and the Sangha (community).
* Taking refuge in these Three Jewels defines a Buddhist.
* The Buddha is Gotama, an enlightened being who realized the Truth (Dhamma) and taught it to others.

## B. The Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha

* The Buddha founded the Sangha, a monastic order that preserves his teachings.
* The Dhamma refers to both the intellectual content of Buddhism and its ethical principles.
* The Sangha traditionally referred to all Buddhists but now primarily refers to ordained monks.

## C. Theravada Buddhism

* Theravada is the branch of Buddhism prevalent in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. 
* It emphasizes tradition and conservatism, claiming to preserve the original teachings of the Buddha.
* Theravada spread from India to Sri Lanka and then to other Southeast Asian countries.

## D. Pali Language and Literature

* Theravada uses Pali as its sacred language and relies on the Pali Canon as scripture.
* The Pali Canon consists of three baskets: Vinaya Pitaka (monastic discipline), Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's sermons), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical analysis).
* Important Pali texts include commentaries, sub-commentaries, and the Visuddhimagga (Path to Purity).

## E. Other Literature and Terminology

* Some Theravada literature is in Sanskrit or local languages.
* The country formerly known as Ceylon is now officially called Sri Lanka.
* Sinhalese monks have names with two parts: village of origin and Pali given name.




## B. A Social **History Of Buddhism?**

* To attempt to write the social history of a religion is problematic and has never been undertaken outside the modern West. 
* Most people view religion through the lens of truth or falsehood, right or wrong, rather than as a subject for empirical study.
* The classic formulation of this problem comes from Edward Gibbon who argued that historians must uncover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption religions acquire over time.

* Religions often have a strong sense of historical awareness, particularly those with human founders like Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. 
* They chart their progress through history, focusing on chronicles of their central institution, the church.
* Unlike Indian Buddhism, monotheistic religions are rich in hagiography, the lives of individual saints.

* In the pre-modern West, historical religious literature saw God as the ultimate cause of all events. 
* Individuals who influence others are seen as endowed with God's grace or charisma.
* Social history seeks to explain historical events not solely through the conscious decisions of individuals but also considers other factors.

* When religious people encounter attempts to explain their beliefs in social terms, they often suspect an attack on their faith. 
* However, investigating the circumstances under which a belief arose does not invalidate it.

* A social account of religion must aim for metaphysical neutrality to command general attention. 
* Explanations based on specific metaphysics may not be accepted by those who do not share that viewpoint.

* Buddhism makes no grandiose claims about explaining everything and accepts impermanence as a fundamental principle. 
* This allows for a metaphysically neutral approach to its history.

* The author rejects the concept of charisma, preferring to focus on the circumstances that make people susceptible to influence.
* He also accepts the role of chance and free will in human affairs.


* While acknowledging the role of socialization and tradition in religious conservatism, the author recognizes the importance of innovation. 
* Innovation itself is not rare, but truly impactful innovations are less common.

# Innovation and Tradition

* Individuals proposing changes use the language of existing traditions for communication.
* Understanding a new message requires understanding the tradition it challenges.

# The Role of Feedback

* Innovation modifies tradition, using it as raw material.
* Artistic creativity relies on feedback between the creator and their work.
* Societal feedback occurs when innovations create new conditions that the innovator reacts to.

# Acceptance and Patronage

* Innovations are remembered if accepted by many or powerful individuals.
* Religions often flourish due to powerful patronage rather than solely idea cogency.

# Cogency of Ideas

* Religious innovation's acceptance depends on offering solutions to existing problems.
* These problems can be cognitive, ethical, social, intellectual, emotional, or practical.
* Religion may offer solutions alongside non-religious ones.

# Solutions to Problems

* Religions often address suffering and human evil.
* Their solutions are generally applicable, allowing for individual interpretation.

# Religious Conservatism

* People accept existing ideas and behaviors due to social pressures until better solutions emerge.
* Innovations are adopted if they offer superior solutions to problems.

# Historical Causation

* Religious innovations should be viewed as answers to problems.
* This perspective provides a research guideline but doesn't fully explain historical causation.




## The Limitations Of Marxist And Weberian Views Of Religion

* Marxist interpretation views economic production as determining culture including religion. 
* Weber's theory sees religion/ideology interacting with socio-economic conditions.

## Defects in Marxist and Weberian Theories

* Marxism doesn't account for social inertia, which can cause cultural forms to persist despite changing material conditions.
* Both theories lack precision, making them difficult to test.
* They offer limited insights into the diversity of religious phenomena.


## The Need for a More Nuanced Approach

* Human culture consists of autonomous areas that don't necessarily move in step.
* Religion is influenced by both its own internal tradition and social circumstances.
* Religious change is often over-determined, responding to various needs.

## The Complexity of Religious Change

* Changes within religion can occur at different speeds and have unintended consequences.
* Religious affiliation often serves as a badge of social group membership.




## Unintended Consequences

* Great events like earthquakes and epidemics have no connection to human will but profoundly influence history.
* Unintended consequences of actions often outweigh intended ones.
* Social institutions operate according to laws independent of individual wills.

## The Sangha

* The Buddha founded the Sangha, a monastic order, to spread and preserve his teachings.
* The Sangha was unique among contemporary renouncers in its organization for preserving scripture.
* The story of the Buddha's reluctance to preach and subsequent founding of the Sangha highlights its focus on the welfare of all beings. 




## What Inquiries Will The Evidence Support?

*  The earliest information about the Buddha and his teachings is found in the Canon.
* While Buddhists consider the Canon to be the word of the Buddha, some texts acknowledge authorship by disciples.
* There's no evidence of writing in India before Emperor Asoka's reign (3rd century BCE), suggesting oral transmission initially preserved the Buddha's words.

* The brahmin system of orally transmitting the Veda demonstrates the reliability of oral tradition.
* Buddhist monks likely followed a similar system, with teachers instructing entrants on texts and specialists focusing on specific textual areas.

* Recent research has revealed allusions to non-Buddhist texts within the Canon, indicating the Buddha's knowledge of Vedic doctrine and practices.
* This intertextuality helps us understand the Buddha's arguments and confirms the antiquity of the texts.

* While the Pali texts are undoubtedly later than the Buddha (written down in the 1st century BCE), their core content displays originality, intelligence, coherence, suggesting a single genius as its author.
* The traditional accounts of the Buddha's life lack canonical foundation, leaving us with limited knowledge about him beyond his ideas.

* Extreme skepticism is not advisable; we should provisionally accept tradition until we have something to replace it while acknowledging our uncertainty.

## Therava¯Din History: The Uneven Pace Of Change

* Theravada Buddhism is considered extremely conservative, with minimal doctrinal change since its origin in ancient India.
* This conservatism necessitates focusing on the Buddha's doctrines as they are central to Theravada beliefs.
* While Theravada practice and sentiment have seen more change, Ceylon has remained remarkably conservative due to its geographical isolation.

* The lack of Brahmin influence and Muslim invasion contributed to Ceylon's religious conservatism.
* The arrival of Christian missionaries in the 19th century marked a significant turning point for Sinhalese Buddhism.

* This confrontation with Christianity is the most significant event in Ceylon's Buddhist history, prompting profound cultural changes.
* Three major points of change are identified: the Buddha's founding of the Sa¯sana, the migration of Buddhism to Ceylon, and the rapid changes of the last 150 years.


## Buddhist Identity

* Defining Christianity and Buddhism is crucial for comparative statistical analysis.
* Determining whether simultaneous belief in both religions should be considered in statistics requires careful consideration.

## I Agree.

* Buddhists view gods as powerful beings who can grant worldly favors, similar to influential individuals. They don't believe in a creator god or any omnipotent deity.
* For Buddhists, religion is solely about understanding and practicing the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings) to achieve salvation (liberation from greed, hatred, and delusion).

## Being told that gods have nothing to do with religion

* The author argues that different religions draw the line between what constitutes religion differently.
* The author disagrees with Rhys Davids' view that Buddhists who worship gods are syncretistic, as long as they don't attribute salvation power to these gods.

## Theravada Buddhism and Other Religions

* The author distinguishes two types of religion: soteriology (focused on individual salvation) and communal religion (concerned with societal order).
* Hinduism is presented as an example of communal religion, while Buddhism primarily focuses on soteriology.
* The author argues that it's normal in India and culturally influenced regions to have both types of religion simultaneously.

## Soteriology vs. Communal Religion

* Soteriologies provide answers to questions about salvation and individual fate, emphasizing belief and doctrine.
* Communal religions focus on societal order, using rituals and social norms to mark life events and maintain social cohesion.
* The author notes that both types of religion may be present within a single system, as seen in Christianity.

## Buddhism's Focus on Soteriology

* The Buddha primarily preached a soteriology, emphasizing the path to individual liberation.
* He viewed communal religion as something to be transcended on the quest for salvation.
* The author cites the late development of a specific Buddhist marriage ritual in Sri Lanka as evidence of Buddhism's historical focus on soteriological concerns rather than communal practices.





# Buddhist Communal Religion

* Buddhists have traditionally lived in peasant societies, requiring communal religions.
* While some forms of Mahayana Buddhism developed communal aspects, Theravada remained more conservative, preserving the Buddha's indifference to such religion and his negative stance on rituals.
* The Buddha emphasized leaving the world behind as inherently unsatisfactory, making any attempt to improve one's worldly life through magic or gods a "worldly" concern rather than a "supra-mundane" one.

# Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka

* Unlike India where Buddhism arrived into an established priestly system, Sri Lanka lacked such structure.
* The communal religion of Sri Lanka was a blend of elements from southern India, with Buddhist priests partially replacing brahmins.
* These diverse elements were not seen as a single system by Sinhalese Buddhists and considered irrelevant to salvation.

# Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia

* Similar to Sri Lanka, Southeast Asian cultures where Theravada spread had "spirit cults" but lacked a unified communal religion.
* These religions shared similarities with Indian popular culture, but were deemed irrelevant to spiritual progress or fate after death.

# Buddhist Identity

* Being a Buddhist layman varies across societies. Unlike Christianity or Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism historically did not dictate specific rituals for life events like weddings.
* In India, supporting holy men of any "path" was considered a norm, allowing for multiple allegiances.
* In Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand, Buddhism became the dominant path to salvation, eliminating multiple allegiances and fostering strong state patronage.

# Misinterpretations of Buddhism

* Some modern Buddhists influenced by Western ideas view Buddhism and Hinduism as mutually exclusive entities like monotheistic religions.
* This misunderstanding has contributed to communal conflict in Sri Lanka, though economic factors and political machinations play a larger role.

# The Buddha as Social Reformer?

* While compassionate and concerned for mankind, the Buddha's focus was on individual reform and leaving society behind, not reforming the world itself.
* He saw life as suffering and offered a solution to escape rebirth, not improve worldly conditions.

# Flexibility in Buddhist Doctrine

* The Buddha compared his teachings to a raft, meant to be used for crossing the river of rebirth but discarded afterwards.
* This emphasizes using one's own judgment and adapting the teachings to individual circumstances.




## The Vedic Tradition

* The text discusses the Vedic period in Indian history, which preceded the Buddha's time.
* "Vedic" refers to the literature from that period, written in an early form of Sanskrit called Vedic Sanskrit.
* The word *veda* means 'knowledge' and refers to sacred knowledge about ultimate matters.

* Vedic texts are considered eternally true and infallible, passed down through inspired sages.
* Buddhists share a similar view on the Dhamma, believing its existence is independent of being cognized.

* In ancient India, social roles were largely determined by birth. Brahmins, the priestly class, had the right and duty to preserve *s´ruti*, the Vedic texts.
*  Brahmins held authority in ideological matters because they were considered the interpreters of the Vedas.

* Heterodox thinkers like the Buddha rejected both the Vedas as the ultimate source of truth and the authority of brahmins.
* The Vedic texts are the primary evidence for understanding religious life during that period, as archaeological evidence is scarce before the 3rd century BCE.

* Vedic literature is divided into three strata: the Samhitas (four Vedas), Brahmanas, and Upanishads. Each stratum builds upon the previous one chronologically.
* The four Vedas are the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. They differ in function, with the Rig Veda containing hymns, the Sama Veda arranging them for chanting, and the Yajur Veda organizing them for sacrificial rituals.

* The Brahmanas expand on the ritual aspects of the Vedas, including instructions, myths, and theological justifications.
* The Upanishads (Vedanta) explore the mystical interpretations of the rituals, revealing their esoteric meaning.

* Historians divide the Vedic age into two halves: c. 1500–c. 1000 BCE and c. 1000–c. 500 BCE.
* The Buddha reacted to the later Vedic texts, particularly the earliest Upanishads like the Brhadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads.

## The Early Vedic Period

* People speaking Sanskrit entered northwest India around the middle of the second millennium BCE. 
* They were pastoralists who gradually settled and began agriculture, mainly growing barley.
* They were led by "kings" in war and used horses but cattle became central to their economy.
* They mixed with people speaking Dravidian languages, leaving little trace of their culture.

## Brahminical Ideology and Dharma

* Brahminical ideology is the only indigenous ideology of society that has influenced all Indians before Muslim invasions.
* *Dharma*, a central concept in this ideology, refers to the ideal world order and how society should behave.
* Brahmins claimed the Vedas as the authority for *dharma* but its content likely derived from custom.
* Local interpretations of *dharma* vary considerably.

## Possession and Altered States of Consciousness

* Many Indian communities value altered states of consciousness, particularly possession.
* Possession involves temporary inhabitation by another spirit, unlike shamanism where the spirit travels while the body remains unconscious.
* Vedic religion involved sacrifices to deities, with priests possibly altering their consciousness using a substance called *soma*.

## Fire and Social Status

* Vedic religion centered on sacrifice, which revolved around fire used for both ritual offerings and practical purposes like cooking.
* Brahmins saw digestion as "cooking" in the stomach's fire.
* Fire symbolized man's conquest of nature and was associated with life, consciousness, thinking, and creativity.
* Early Vedic society likely had four main social statuses: priests, rulers, ordinary people, and slaves. 




## Later Vedic Society

* The Indo-Aryans became more settled and agricultural, growing rice and using ploughs.
* Iron was used mainly for weapons.
* Their cultural centre shifted to the Upper Gangetic plains.

## The Cosmic Man

* The *Purus.a-su¯kta* hymn describes a cosmic man whose body represents society.
* Society is divided into four hierarchical classes: brahmins, ksatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras.
* Brahmins are the mouth of the cosmic man, representing knowledge and language.

## The Four Classes

* Ksatriyas are the arms, symbolizing power and rulership.
* Vaisyas are the loins, responsible for economic production and fertility.
* Sudras serve the other three classes.

## Varna and Caste

* These four classes are known as *varnas*, meaning 'colour'.
* Each varna was associated with a colour: white (brahmin), red (ksatriya), yellow (vaishya), black (sudra).
* Varnas were hereditary and exclusive.

## Outcastes

* People outside the varna system were considered outcastes.
* They were excluded from mainstream society and relegated to degraded roles.

## Purity and Pollution

* Brahminical ideology used purity as a way to rank social groups.
* Higher groups were considered 'purer' than lower ones.
* Concepts of purity and pollution were linked to cleanliness and bodily functions.


## Death and Rebirth

* The *R.g Veda* mentions ancestors in heaven, but suggests a cycle of death and rebirth.
* People may return to earth through rain, staying within the same kin group.
* Rebirth is not determined by good or bad behaviour.

## Religion In The Later Vedic Period

* This section discusses the distinction between rituals of public and domestic significance in the later Vedic period.
* It highlights that qualified individuals could perform domestic rituals, while public rituals were mainly instituted by rulers who employed brahmin priests.

* This section explores the symbiotic relationship between kings and brahmin priests in Vedic society.
* Kings relied on brahmins for performing sacrifices to ensure the welfare of their subjects and maintain cosmic order.
* Brahmins depended on kings for material support, creating a complementary dynamic.

* This section examines the different layers of Vedic literature: Samhitas, Brahmanas, and Upanishads.
* Each layer serves a distinct function: Samhitas provide ritual words, Brahmanas offer instructions and myths, and Upanishads present esoteric interpretations.
* Despite their differences, these texts are interconnected and reflect a unified religious worldview.

* This section contrasts the religious climate of the Rig Veda with that of the Upanishads.
* While the Rig Veda focuses on obtaining material benefits through sacrifices, the Upanishads delve into metaphysical doctrines and soteriological concerns.
* It emphasizes the varying rates of change within different aspects of religion and culture.

* This section traces the evolution of sacrificial theory in the Vedic period.
* Early hymns portray sacrifice as a transactional exchange with gods for worldly gains.
* Later hymns explore deeper philosophical questions about the nature of sacrifice and the underlying unity of reality.

* This section introduces the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality underlying all phenomena.
* It explains how the Vedas, Sanskrit language, and brahmins are seen as interconnected with Brahman.
* The equivalence of macrocosm and microcosm is discussed, with Purusha Sukta highlighting the cosmic man who embodies the universe through sacrifice.

* This section explores the Upanishadic doctrine of Atman-Brahman identity.
* It explains how understanding this unity liberates individuals from the cycle of rebirth and suffering.
* The role of gnosis (realization) as a path to liberation is emphasized.

* This section examines the practice of yoga, encompassing both mortification of the flesh and meditation.
* Tapas, or ascetic practices, were traditionally seen as a means to attain supernatural powers.
* Meditation, on the other hand, was associated with gnostic soteriology and aimed at achieving insight into the true nature of reality.

# Meditation

* Indian yogic traditions combine asceticism and meditation.
* Jainism emphasizes mortification of the flesh, while other religions advocate for a simple lifestyle and indifference to worldly pleasures.
* Salvation involves cultivating indifference to pleasure and pain and freedom from desire and aversion.

# Sacrifice

* Early Vedic sacrifices relied on gods granting benefits.
* As brahminical speculation developed, sacrifices were seen as effective due to an omnipresent causal force called 'the unseen'.
* Sacrifices became prototypical for any religious act, including reciting the Veda.

# Karma And Escape From Rebirth

* *Karman* refers to significant acts, especially rituals.
* The theory of *karman* states that all actions have consequences, both good and bad.
* Brahmins initially focused on ritualistic *karman*, but later expanded it to include moral qualities.
* Hinduism views morality as extrinsic, tied to social context, while Buddhism ethicized the concept.

# Life Cycle And Renunciation

* Brahminism emphasizes a life cycle with distinct stages, including householder and renunciation.
* The householder's role is crucial for societal continuance through production and reproduction.
* Desire motivates action and keeps one in the world of *karman*, ensuring rebirth.
* *Karman* explains suffering as consequences of past actions.

# Renunciation

* Renouncers (sam. *nya¯sin*) seek escape from the cycle of rebirth by leaving society.
* Renunciation represents a rejection of social obligations and worldly attachments.
* It involves homelessness, abandoning fire sacrifices, abstaining from production and reproduction, and seeking altered states of consciousness.

## B. The Social Conditions Of His Day

* The Buddha was born in Kapilavatthu, a town in what is now the Nepalese Terai, and spent his life in what is now Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh.
* The Buddha's community, the S´a¯kyas, were not organized according to the brahminical *varn.a* system but had servants.

* They were self-governing and their polity was based on a council of household heads who made decisions by consensus.

* This model of a casteless society influenced the organization of the Buddha's Sangha.
* The Buddha, speaking in brahminical terms, described himself as a *ks.atriya*, likely due to the power dynamics of the time.

##  The Material Conditions Of The Society In Which The Buddha Preached

* The Buddha lived during a period of urbanization and the emergence of states ruled by kings from urban capitals.
* This period also saw the first use of money and the beginnings of organized trade, indicating an agricultural surplus.
* The surplus may have been due to the spread of population into the fertile Gangetic plain, rather than solely technological advancements like iron tools or rice transplantation.

##  The Rise Of Towns And Cities

* Towns and cities arose as centers of political and commercial activity, fueled by trade and an economic surplus.
* Trade requires infrastructure (communications, legality, security) provided by stable political conditions, often facilitated by kings who build roads and ensure safety.

# The Rise of Buddhism

* Awareness of foreign cultures was crucial to the rise of Buddhism.
* Contact with other cultures could occur through trade or military conquest. 
* Evidence suggests contact between India and Babylon, highlighting cultural exchange.

# Trade and Urbanization

* Early Buddhist texts mention long-distance trading, primarily via land routes.
* The *Kevaddha Sutta* indicates seafaring merchants used birds for navigation.
* Literacy's role in trade is uncertain; writing may have been limited to accounting.
* Archaeological evidence for cities from the Buddha's time is scarce due to building materials.

# Cities and Kingdoms

* Earliest Indian cities date back to around 600 BCE, including Kaus´ambı¯ and Ujjain.
* Buddhist texts mention numerous towns, with Ra¯jagaha, Vesa¯lı¯, and Sa¯vatthı¯ being prominent.
* The concept of "large countries" (*maha¯ janapada*) emerged, representing significant political entities.

# Power Structures

* Indian kings were initially seen as rulers of men rather than territory.
* Heesterman suggests the Hindu state was viewed as a field of power emanating from the king.
* Two critical leaps in kingdom size occurred: the establishment of "large countries" and later, the Mauryan empire.
* Larger units subsumed smaller ones, creating complex hierarchies of lordship.

# New Professions

* The growth of larger political structures led to new professions like state officials and traders.
* Brahmins likely dominated bureaucracy, although the *varn.a* system didn't initially recognize this role.
* Early brahmin ideology lacked a place for trade, which was later assigned to the *vais´ya*.

# Brahmin Attitudes Towards Cities

* Brahmin law-givers were hostile towards cities.
* Gautama prohibited Vedic recitation in cities, while Baudha¯yana believed salvation was impossible for city dwellers.
* Brahmin orthodoxy's countless rules were designed for village life, not urban environments. 




## To Whom Did The Buddha'S Message Appeal?

* Evidence suggests that the Buddha's message appealed primarily to town dwellers and new social classes. 
* Analysis of early Buddhist texts indicates that a significant portion of monks and nuns came from large towns, with many belonging to upper-class urban families.
* While Buddhism welcomed anyone into its community, it wasn't primarily a religion for the downtrodden.

## Who Were The Buddha’s Lay Supporters?

* The term "gahapati" (householder) frequently appears in canonical texts, referring to heads of respectable families, typically from the *vaisya* class.
* These individuals often owned land and engaged in business, representing a class akin to gentleman farmers or urban merchants.

## Social Change and Religious Malaise

* Rapid urbanization and social change likely contributed to spiritual unrest during the Buddha's time.
* This shift led to a more complex division of labor, less reliance on kinship groups, and greater individual freedom, potentially causing uncertainty and doubt.

## Disease and Mortality as Contributing Factors

* The warmer climate of the Ganges region may have facilitated the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria.
* Increased population density in urban centers likely heightened disease incidence and mortality, creating a sense of vulnerability and impermanence.


## The Buddha's Message: The Middle Way

* The Buddha preached the "middle way," avoiding the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification.
* His own experience led him to this path after experimenting with both ascetic practices and meditative techniques.

# The First Sermon

* The Buddha initially hesitated to preach, doubting if his message would be appreciated.
* Brahma¯, the god representing brahminical monism, persuaded him to teach.
* He decided to preach to his former companions but discovered they had died.
* He met an ascetic on his way and announced his Enlightenment.

# The Content of the First Sermon

* We don't know the exact words of the Buddha's first sermon.
* The compilers of the Canon included what they believed were the core elements of his Enlightenment.
* Buddhism is presented as the "Middle Way," a term with various interpretations.
* It primarily refers to the practice of those who would become the Sangha, balancing indulgence and asceticism.

# The Middle Way

* This middle way between indulgence and asceticism informs the Sangha's rules of life.
* It contrasts with the brahminical idealization of sensual pleasure and the ascetic extremes.
* The Buddha rejected asceticism decisively, defining *tapas* (austerity) as meditation and reasoned moral discipline in Buddhism.

# The Four Noble Truths

* The Buddha revealed the content of his liberating insight through the Four Noble Truths: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path to cessation.
* *Dukkha*, translated as "suffering," encompasses a broader meaning than mere pain; it signifies dissatisfaction with life.
* Suffering arises from "thirst" or desire, which can be eradicated, leading to liberation.

# The Noble Eightfold Path

* The Fourth Noble Truth outlines the path to liberation: the Noble Eightfold Path.
* This path is often summarized as three stages: morality, meditation, and wisdom.
* Each stage is considered a prerequisite for the next, culminating in "seeing things as they are" through wisdom.

# Enlightenment and Practice

* The Buddha emphasized his own realization of *nibba¯na*, the deathless state, as the basis for his teaching.
* He criticized brahmins for teaching without personal experience.
* The Dhamma, while being Truth, also prescribes actions to realize that truth.
* "Skilful" and "unskilful" replace moral terms, emphasizing mental states conducive to progress.

# Desire, Ignorance, and Liberation

* Identifying desire as the origin of suffering aligns with ascetic traditions but is more complex in Buddhism.
* The Chain of Dependent Origination explains that desire stems from ignorance, which initiates a sequence leading to suffering.
* Greed, hatred, and delusion are identified as the "roots of evil," intertwined with desire and ignorance.

# Nibba¯na: Extinction of Fire

* *Nibba¯na* is often misunderstood as the extinction of the soul or self, but this is incorrect.
* The Buddha taught that beings have no abiding essence (anattava¯da).
* He analyzed individuals into five components: body, feelings, perception, volitions, and consciousness, none of which constitute a permanent self.

# The No-Soul Doctrine

* This doctrine aims to show that life is unsatisfactory due to its impermanence and lack of an enduring essence.
* Recognizing the absence of a self leads to the eradication of selfishness and desire.
* *Nibba¯na* is not a thing but an experience characterized by the absence of greed, hatred, and delusion.

# Samsa¯ra: Experience Within

* *Samsara*, the opposite of *nibba¯na*, is also an experience rather than a thing.
* The Buddha's statement that "the world is within this fathom-long body" suggests focusing on our own experience.
* He challenged the brahminical focus on the existence of the *a¯tman* (soul), emphasizing instead the reality of suffering (*dukkha*)

# Meditation: Concentration and Insight


* Buddhist meditation has two forms: concentration, aimed at achieving one-pointedness and stillness of mind, and insight, focused on understanding the nature of reality.

# Awareness

* Buddhists aim to achieve clarity by cultivating awareness.
* This involves being aware of physical sensations, feelings, states of mind, and thoughts.
* The goal is to cease identifying with these phenomena as a "self," recognizing them as transient.
* Awareness should be practiced in everyday life and religious experience.

# Unselfishness and Carefulness

* Unselfishness and carefulness are core Buddhist values.
* Four "divine" states of mind: kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.
* The Buddha preached out of compassion (*karun.a¯*), and Buddhists emphasize selfless kindness.
* *Metta* Sutta is a meditation on kindness, aiming to suffuse the world with well-being.

# Buddhist Path

* Buddhism emphasizes positive values like kindness and unselfishness over negative moral precepts.
* Five undertakings: not to kill, steal, be unchaste, lie, or take intoxicants.
* Primary duty is generosity, particularly towards the Sangha (Buddhist community).
* The path to a good rebirth and liberation involves generosity, upholding moral precepts, and cultivating the mind.

# Buddhist Cosmology

* The world is layered with heavens above and hells below, but no situation is permanent.
* One's position is determined by past actions (*kamma*).
* *Sam.sa¯ra*, the world and life in it, has no beginning because everything arises from a cause (Dependent Origination).
* There is no creator god as *kamma* explains suffering.
* Death and desire are interconnected; the realm of Desire is presided over by Mara, representing death. 




## The Dhamma In Its Context: Answers To Brahminism

### The Dhamma and its Rivals

* Two rival analyses of life's problems existed at the time: intellectualist (lack of understanding) and emotionalist (lack of self-control).
* The Buddha combined both, arguing that passion blinds us and emotions control us because we don't see things as they are.
* This position appeals to both types of thinkers.

### Challenging Brahminical Doctrine

* The Buddha challenged the brahminical view of an eternal self found in the *Upanisads* and *Vedanta*.
* He accepted the macrocosm-microcosm equivalence but denied the essence of the individual and the world, rejecting a creator god or underlying unity.
* He redefined *karman*, making morality intrinsic and denying ritualistic value for salvation.

### Ethics Over Ritual

* The Buddha ethicized *karman*, emphasizing intention over action.
* This challenged brahminical caste-bound ethics as intentions are universally good or bad, not dependent on social status.
* He redefined "pure" actions as virtuous ones (*puñña kamma*), leading to rewards in this and future lives through mental purification.

### Internalizing Karman

* By internalizing *karman*, the Buddha addressed its communal nature and worldly focus.
* Good actions, while foundational, don't require rebirth for reward; their value translates into mental purity.
* This aligns with Buddhist meditation practices, where moral goodness aids in achieving *nibba¯na*.

### Autonomy and Conscience

* Since ethical value lies in intention, the individual is autonomous, with conscience as the final authority.
* Monks weren't disciplined for offenses they didn't admit, reflecting this emphasis on personal responsibility.
* Lay Buddhists undertake moral commitments personally, signifying conscious subscription to their meaning.

### Ritual vs. Morality

* Ritual lacks ethical value for Buddhists and doesn't contribute to salvation.
* It's not forbidden unless immoral acts are involved but isn't actively encouraged either.
* The Buddha promoted substituting moral practices for ritualistic ones, seeing attachment to rituals as a hindrance to spiritual progress.

### Subverting Brahminism

* Buddhism undermines brahminical authority by denying their monopoly on sacred knowledge and mediation with the divine.
* True religious status comes from personal effort, not ascribed social standing.
* The Buddha redefined "brahmin" based on universal values like gentleness and honesty, regardless of birth.

### A Universe Governed by Ethics

* Ethicizing *karman* turns the universe into an ethical arena where beings are placed according to their deeds.
* This view suggests a correlation between power/well-being and virtue, with gods being more powerful due to their greater virtue.
* Even demons act justly as instruments of karmic retribution.

### Social Implications

* The ethic of intention has radical implications for social order, questioning the *ksatriya*'s traditional role of using force.
* While Buddhists may justify violence in certain circumstances, there's often a sense of unease about its moral basis.
* This tension is exemplified by Emperor Asoka, who declared himself Buddhist but still engaged in warfare and justice administration.



# The Future Buddha

* Born as a king's heir, he witnesses his father sentencing criminals to death.
* Remembering past lives where he also inflicted suffering, he resolves to avoid becoming king.
* He pretends to be deaf-mute, resisting all attempts to provoke him.
* His father orders his execution, but the future Buddha speaks for the first time and preaches to the executioner, then his parents, converting the entire city.

# The Buddha's Critique of Social Roles

* The Buddha primarily criticized brahmins and their claim to authority based on the Vedas.
* He did not explicitly criticize royal power and had to accommodate kings.

# Authority in Buddhism

* The Buddha placed authority in the Dhamma (Truth), which he realized.
* His word was authoritative, but access to it was through the Sangha who preserved and interpreted it.

# Access to Buddhist Texts

* In an oral culture, people relied on monks for access to scriptures and their interpretation.
* Even after written texts emerged, they were rare and confined to monasteries.

# Democratization of Buddhism

* Unlike brahmins who restricted knowledge, the Buddha aimed for accessibility.
* He instructed monks to preach in local languages, rejecting Sanskrit and ritualized chanting.


# The Ka¯la¯ma Sutta and Individual Conscience

* This text encourages individuals to test religious doctrines through experience.
* However, the Buddha is confident that following his advice will lead people to accept his teachings.
* His message is not "Make your own truth" but "Make the Truth your own."

## Buddhism As Religious Individualism

* The Buddha's Dhamma represents a strong form of religious individualism.
* This means individuals are responsible for their own spiritual destiny and have the right to work out their own salvation.
* Buddhism exemplifies this through its doctrine of *kamma*, which emphasizes spiritual equality, and its focus on awareness as religious self-scrutiny.

## The Appeal of Buddhism

* The Buddha's doctrine of karma, emphasizing free will, was a unique and powerful idea that resonated with people in ancient India.
* Many people lived relatively free from oppression during this period, which may have contributed to the acceptance of these ideas.
* Similar to the Protestant Reformation in Europe, Buddhism appealed to merchants and urban dwellers who sought a more individualistic approach to religion.

## Lay Followers and Monks

* While both Protestants and Buddhists rejected religious intermediaries, they differed in their views on achieving salvation.
* Protestants aimed for salvation while remaining in the world, whereas early Buddhists believed leaving the social world was necessary for enlightenment.
* This difference stemmed from the practical necessity of meditation, which required peace and privacy not available in traditional Indian society.

## The Path to Enlightenment

* The Buddha likely believed that lay people could attain certain spiritual stages but not full enlightenment (*nibba¯na*) in this life.
* He emphasized that monks and nuns were best suited for attaining enlightenment due to their dedicated practice of meditation.
* While some lay people lived ascetic lives similar to monks, they were exceptions rather than the rule.

## Lay Discipleship

* The Buddha's sermons to laity mainly focused on morality, leading to a good rebirth but not necessarily *nibba¯na*.
* He categorized his audience into three groups: monks/nuns, lay disciples, and ascetics/brahmins.
* A lay disciple (*upa¯saka*) was someone who expressed reverence for the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, often through acts of generosity and support for the monastic community.

## Religious Affiliation in Ancient India

* In traditional India, religious affiliation was not as clear-cut as in later societies.
* Becoming a Buddhist likely involved expressing faith in the Buddha's teachings and supporting the monastic community through donations and respectful interactions.

# The Buddhist Layman

*  Many individuals likely maintained a Buddhist identity by honoring monks and nuns while continuing to practice local communal religions.
* They might have participated in traditional rituals, observed Hindu festivals, and sought favors from deities through priests.

# Taking Vows

* Buddhist laymen were encouraged to take moral vows, including the Five Precepts (similar to Jain precepts) which emphasized awareness (*appama¯da*) and abstaining from intoxicants.
* On *uposatha* days, they could take Eight Precepts for a day and night, involving chastity, dietary restrictions, and avoiding adornment or entertainment.

# The Buddha and Calvin

* Both the Buddha and Calvin privatized religion, making salvation an individual matter.
* However, Calvin sought public evidence of salvation through social standing, while the Buddha believed salvation was a private, intimate experience not to be demonstrated.

# Buddhism and Trade

* Buddhism appealed to people in a changing world where impersonal interactions were becoming more common.
* A shared ethical framework based on universal moral law could foster trust in business transactions and dealings with officials.
* Buddhism's portability made it suitable for those who traveled, spreading along trade routes.

# Achieved Status

* Buddhism appealed to individuals who did not fit into the traditional *varn.a* system.
* The Buddha challenged brahminical notions of ingrained social hierarchy by pointing to cultural variations where status was achieved rather than ascribed.
* He satirized brahminical beliefs and suggested that social status is a matter of power.

## An Ethic For The Socially Mobile

* Immorality leads to five disadvantages: poverty, bad reputation, social diffidence, anxiety on deathbed and bad rebirth.
* Moral behavior brings five benefits: wealth in this life to a good rebirth in the next.
* Diligence is key to success in both this world and the next. 
* Wealth acquired righteously should be used for dependents, protection, offerings, and charity.

## The Layman's Ethical Duties

* Six outlets for wealth to avoid: drinking, late nights out, fairs, gambling, bad company, laziness.
* Half of wealth for business, a quarter consumed, and a quarter saved.
* Religious donations are part of consumption and buy a place in heaven.
* The Buddha reinterprets traditional rituals with new ethical meanings.

## Duties Towards Others

* Husbands should provide adornment for wives, who should manage earnings skillfully.
* Servants should be given work according to strength, food, wages, care when ill, rare delicacies, holidays, and spoken well of.
* Householders should be friendly to religious wanderers and brahmins, providing for their needs.

## Economic Success and Social Context

* Lay life has four forms of happiness: economic security, enough for consumption, freedom from debt, and a righteous life.
* Both householder and renouncer paths can lead to good or bad results depending on conduct.
* Buddhism is like trade in its affinity with monetization and demystification of the world.

## Demystification and the Act of Truth

* The 'act of truth' enables miracles by asserting excellence in one's social role. 
* A courtesan uses an act of truth to make the Ganges flow backwards, demonstrating the rational ethic of the tradesman: "You're as good as the colour of your money."
* *Kamma*, like cash in economics, is a universalizer in the ethical sphere, judging individuals by the quality of their actions. 




## The Buddha On Kings And Politics

* Misunderstandings arise from failing to differentiate between real kings and fictional ones in Buddhist texts.
* The Buddha met with several kings but did not seem interested in politics or influencing political outcomes.
* Kings are depicted as both protectors and predators, capable of violence.
* Violence was considered legitimate for maintaining order, though the Buddha advocated compassion.

## The Ku¯t.adanta Sutta

* This parable tells of a king advised to improve his people's welfare instead of relying on sacrifices.
* It suggests that poverty leads to crime and that kings are responsible for addressing economic hardship.
* While advocating for social responsibility, the text primarily benefits the propertied classes.

## The Cakkavatti-sı¯hana¯da Sutta

* This sermon presents a cyclical view of history with periods of moral decline and renewal.
* It includes advice from a world ruler to his son on good governance, emphasizing protection of the righteous and seeking guidance from holy men.
* Poverty is identified as the root cause of theft, highlighting the king's responsibility for economic well-being.

## The Aggañña Sutta

* This text satirizes Brahminical beliefs through an aetiological myth explaining the origins of the world.
* It humorously claims that kingship originated from a need to maintain order and that *ksatriyas* should rank above brahmins.

# General Principles Of The Vinaya

* The *Vinaya Pitaka* provides a complete way of life for monks, nuns and novices in the Sangha.
* It balances detailed rules with general principles, ensuring both structure and flexibility.
* The *vinaya* emphasizes "being content with little" as key to overcoming craving and achieving a simple life.

* Monks are encouraged to be self-reliant, independent of external resources.
* Living according to the *vinaya* is seen as embodying the spiritual goal of attaining *nibba¯na*.


# The Sangha: A Community of Individuals

* The Sangha is a community of self-reliant individuals seeking Enlightenment.
* Buddhism values both wisdom and compassion, which are considered inseparable.

* There is tension between personal progress and helping others, reflecting the duality inherent in Buddhism.
* Monks contribute to an atmosphere conducive to fellow monks' enlightenment while also considering the needs of the laity.

* The Sangha represents a middle way between brahminism (community over individuality) and Jainism (individuality over community).


# The Vinaya: Balancing Individual and Community Needs

* The *Vinaya* rules aim to institutionalize the Middle Way, balancing indulgence and discomfort for individuals.
* The *Vinaya* also prioritizes the community rationale, focusing on the Sangha's protection, moral purity, growth, and benefit to society.

* Buddha's rules often address lay dissatisfaction and are seen as solutions to emerging problems.
* The process of forming the *Vinaya* is depicted as ongoing and responsive to changing circumstances.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules

* Modern scholars believe the *vinaya* developed over two to three centuries.
* One scholar dates the *Vinaya Pitaka* to the third century BCE, but the author argues for an earlier date due to references to ancient practices and lack of mention of larger states.
* Even if the Mauryan empire is accepted as a later development, there's still a century for the *Vinaya* to have developed.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* Different recensions of the *Vinaya Pitaka* exist, each claiming authority from the First Council but differing in details and arrangement.
* This suggests additions were made after sects split off.
* Most early splits likely occurred in the third century BCE, with the *Maha¯sa¯nghikas* possibly being older.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* Older recensions, besides the Pali, survive only in Chinese translation and haven't been translated back into other languages.
* Frauwallner summarized the contents of one part (*Khandhaka*) and suggests it was composed about a century after the Buddha's death, possibly related to the Second Council.
* The author believes divergences between Pali and Chinese versions aren't significant enough to affect their arguments.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* The author trusts Rhys Davids and Oldenberg's 1880 dating of the *Vinaya*'s completion around 350 BCE, despite skepticism about the Buddhists' claim of its origin at the First Council.
* While the language and case histories seem stereotyped and compiled later, the internal consistency and cross-referencing with the *Sutta Pitaka* suggest careful fabrication if it is indeed one.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* The *pa¯timokkha*, a list of monastic rules recited fortnightly, isn't part of the Canon but has canonical status.
* Half the *Vinaya Pitaka* (*Sutta-vibhan.*ga) is commentary on this code.
* The other half (*Khandhaka*) deals with community life rules.

## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* It's tempting to assume a progression from rigor to laxity in the *Vinaya*'s development, but this isn't supported by evidence.
* The practice of 'laundering' gifts for monks through intermediaries existed early on, suggesting institutionalization rather than primitive simplicity.


## Dating And Development Of The Rules (cont.)

* The Buddha himself acknowledged a shift from simpler living to more comfortable conditions during his lifetime.
* The *Vinaya*, as it stands, presents a coherent picture, and rejecting its account leaves us with no definitive knowledge of the Sangha's development.
* The author agrees that while some rules may have been added later, the Theravadin interpretation is crucial regardless of their origin.

## The Middle Way Between Discomfort And Indulgence

* The Buddha stressed that monks should be subjectively satisfied, neither seeking comfort nor discomfort. 

* Monks are allowed four 'requisites': clothing (three robes), begging bowl, dwelling and medicine.

* There are also eight items permitted: three robes, begging bowl, razor, needle, belt and water-strainer.
* Property beyond these lists belonged to the Sangha as a corporate body, not individuals.

* Monks are told they have four 'resorts': eating food got by begging; wearing rags from dustheaps; living at the foot of a tree; using fermented cattle urine as medicine.

* Anything more comfortable is to be regarded as an extra, not to be relied on.

* The Buddha did not insist on asceticism and rejected making practices like vegetarianism compulsory.

* A list of ascetic options in what one ate or wore or where one lived came to be classified as thirteen *dhutan.*ga.
* These practices are allowed only if undertaken for the right reasons, such as cultivating 'being content with little'.

* Some ascetic practices are mutually exclusive and monks tend to take them up one at a time.

* Monks practicing asceticism must not draw attention to the fact.


## The Sangha's Tendency Towards Luxury

* The Sangha has been criticized for being too comfortable, in contrast to other renouncers like Jains.
* This tendency towards luxury has led to demands for its 'purification'.

* There is an ambiguity in the position of the ascetic: they are both outside and above society.

* Respect for freedom from material wants is a universal Indian value.

* The more a monk demonstrates indifference to worldly comforts, the more he impresses the laity and receives material support.
* Monks cannot refuse gifts made to the Sangha, but may deflect them from their own use.


## Homelessness and Monasteries

* Homelessness is central to the tradition of renunciation in India.

* Buddhist monks were allowed to stay in one place for three months during the rainy season.

* While there was no rule requiring constant movement, monasteries began to be established.
* Initially monks were not allowed to reside in buildings, but this changed over time.

* Monasteries required organization and officials to manage communal possessions and accept meals from the laity.
* Monks still had no rights to property in one monastery rather than another.

* They were encouraged to travel and spread the word, even during the rainy season.

# Considerations of Decorum

* The Buddha strongly emphasized decorum for the Sangha due to its importance in society.
* Monks are expected to present a picture of calm control with slow, measured steps and quiet demeanor.
* The *pa¯timokkha* includes rules about proper behavior when eating, preaching, or appearing in public.

# Washing Practices

* While brahmins bathed frequently under ritual prescription, Jain ascetics avoided bathing for fear of killing bugs.
* The Buddha's attitude towards washing was not explicitly stated in the *vinaya*, but references suggest it was frequent.

# Dress and Appearance

* Monks shaved their heads upon admission to differentiate themselves from householders who tended to their hair.
* Shaving the head made a person's sex less obvious and depersonalized them.
* The Buddha frowned on nudity, allowing monks to be naked only in bathrooms or when covered by water.

# Robes and Clothing

* Initially, monks wore robes made of discarded rags found in refuse or cemeteries.
* After the Buddha fell ill, he was gifted a robe, and monks were allowed to accept cloth from laity.
* Monks wear three robes, while nuns have two extra pieces of clothing.
* Torn robes are not permitted, and each monk and nun possesses a needle and thread for repairs.

# Robe Ownership and Distribution

* Robes were the monk's most valuable private property, but they could be exchanged or given to parents in need.
* Spare robes belonged to the community (monastery) and were managed by special officers.
* During the rains retreat, laity offer new material for a robe called *kat.hina*, which is stitched together and offered to a deserving monk.

# Sandals, Umbrellas, and Alms-Bowls

* Monks were allowed to wear simple sandals but not normally within the monastery.
* Umbrellas were prohibited except within the monastery, as they were seen as a sign of social dignity.
* Monks always ate from their own alms-bowls made of earthenware or non-precious metals.

# Food Consumption

* Monks were forbidden to get food for themselves and could only consume what was given by others.
* They were indifferent to the quality of their food and not allowed to express preferences.
* While monks are not vegetarians, they refuse meat killed specifically for them.


# Obtaining Food

* The Sangha initially obtained food through begging, silently walking door-to-door receiving offerings.
* Monks do not thank donors but may offer edifying words about the merit gained.
* Lay invitations to meals were also accepted, with a monastery officer deciding who should attend.

# Storing and Cooking Food

* Originally, storing and cooking food were prohibited as they were associated with householder life.
* Exceptions were made during famines when people brought food supplies to the monastery.
* While rules against cooking and storing food are widely observed in the letter, lay servants often handle and prepare food within monasteries.

# The Disbarring Offences And Enforcement Of Chastity

* Monks who commit any of the four *pa¯ra¯jika* offences are deemed to be no longer monks. 
* These offences include: having sexual intercourse, taking something not given (above a trifling value), intentionally killing or causing to kill a human being, and falsely claiming miraculous powers.
* Nuns have eight *pa¯ra¯jika* offences, with the last two concerning sexual offences.

* The Buddha condemned sexual desire and activity both literally and metaphorically. 
* He did not hold the view that sexual desire is the woman's fault and sexual intercourse the result of female temptation of the male.
* He exhorted men to respect women, regarding them as mothers, sisters or daughters depending on their age.

# Hierarchies Of Age And Sex

* The Buddha never questioned the social hierarchies of age and sex. 
* While all were equal in their capacity for Enlightenment, age and male gender had precedence in social relations within the Sangha.
* Senior monks presided at ceremonies and generally had precedence in ecclesiastical affairs.
* Nuns were subject to both their own hierarchy of seniority and to monks.

* The relation of teacher and pupil is crucial in Buddhism. 
* Every novice and junior monk becomes the personal responsibility of a preceptor who teaches him everything he needs to know.
* Remarkably, the early Buddhist view emphasizes the pupil's duty to criticize his teacher if the teacher has taken up a wrong doctrinal position or is in danger of saying something unsuitable.





## The Formal Organization Of The Sangha

* The Sangha has communal ceremonies called "Acts of the Sangha" which are purely functional and lack ritual elaboration.
* Two crucial ceremonies are the higher ordination (*upasampada¯*) and the communal rehearsal of the *pa¯timokkha*.

* Buddhist ordination comes in two stages: novice ordination (pabbajja¯) and higher ordination (*upasampada¯*). 
    * Novice ordination is for boys aged seven or eight, while higher ordination occurs at age twenty.
    * Higher ordination requires a quorum of ten monks (five in border areas), who must be learned and have been ordained for at least ten years.

* The Sangha's only sanction is expulsion.
* Confession is compulsory and serves as the main punishment for most offenses.

* The *pa¯timokkha* code lists 227 offenses, categorized by penalty severity.
* The *pa¯timokkha* ceremony occurs every fortnight on full moon and new moon days (*uposatha* days).
* Monks confess to each other before the communal ceremony, which affirms their purity.

* The *pa¯timokkha* ceremony is crucial for maintaining Sangha unity. 
    * It ensures regular gatherings and strengthens face-to-face relationships among monks.
    * A monastic boundary (*sı¯ma¯*) defines the community for the ceremony.




## Sect Formation: Therava¯Da Defined

* The Sangha, ideally, operates unanimously, but voting exists for disagreements.
* A split occurs when at least four monks on each side hold separate ceremonies.
* Splitting is a technical matter of *vinaya*, monastic behavior.
* Disagreements leading to splits often concern *vinaya* points.
* Different versions of the *pa¯timokkha* code arise from splits and regional variations.

## Maintaining Conformity

* The *pa¯timokkha* code includes an offense against "clinging to evil views," but it doesn't equate to heresy.
* This offense involves propounding a view contrary to Buddha's teachings, specifically about obstructions to monastic life.
* While the *pa¯timokkha* is a system of self-regulation, individual monks can act in bad faith, and corporate decisions may override individual conscience.
* Other regulatory systems exist alongside the *pa¯timokkha*, such as committees of senior monks appointed to settle disputes.
* Respect for seniority and experience is crucial in the Sangha's decision-making process.
* Unanimity in decision-making was another principle emphasized by the Buddha.
* The Buddha encouraged monks to live together harmoniously, practicing loving kindness and avoiding silence during retreats.

## Relations Between Ordained And Laity

* Buddhist monks believe their primary service is showing others the path to end suffering.
* Monks acknowledge they can alleviate temporary suffering but permanent relief comes from individual effort.
* The Buddha established the Sangha as a missionary organization, encouraging monks to preach widely.
* A reciprocal relationship existed between the Sangha and laity: the Sangha offered teachings (Dhamma), while laity provided material support.

## 5 The Accommodation Between Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* **A. Buddhist Devotion:**
    *  Religious movements often experience unintended consequences due to their success.
    * Developments like property use by proxy, control of lay labor, and denying slaves entry into the Sangha likely weren't intended by the Buddha.
* **120 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India:**
    * While Buddhism doesn't emphasize blind faith, it does value *pasa¯da*, a calm and happy confidence in Buddhist teachings.
    * This confidence is seen as beneficial and contributes to the path towards enlightenment.

## The Buddha As An Object Of Faith And Devotion

* The Buddha is the primary object of religious emotion in Buddhism.
* While the Buddha likely wouldn't have approved, a "personality cult" developed around him.
* Buddhist lay religiosity, with its devotional practices, seems to differ from what the Buddha intended.

## 122 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* The Buddha is considered dead and inactive in the world, although some individuals pray to him in moments of crisis.
* Theravada Buddhism has a limited ideological base for cult and mythology compared to other religions.
* Stories about the Buddha's former births (Jatakas) became a major genre of Buddhist literature.

## Pilgrimage

* The Maha¯ Parinibba¯na Sutta serves as the charter for Buddhist pilgrimage, stating that an Enlightened person should be buried under a stupa.
* Buddhists venerate places associated with the Buddha's life, especially Bodh Gaya¯, the site of his Enlightenment.
* As Buddhism spread, new myths arose about the Buddha visiting different countries, creating additional pilgrimage centers.

## Relics


* The cult of relics is more important than pilgrimage and was likely invented by Buddhists.
* The Maha¯ Parinibba¯na Sutta mentions that after the Buddha's cremation, his relics were divided into eight parts. 


## 124 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* The Buddha's death and funeral symbolically reversed the normal process of nature.
* Stupas originated as tombs for the Buddha's relics, which were believed to be sacred.
* Relics are classified into three kinds: corporeal, objects used by the Buddha, and reminders.
* Early Buddhist art avoided direct portrayals of the Buddha, using objects associated with him instead.

## Mortuary Rituals And 'Transfer Of Merit'

* Theravada Buddhist monks officiate at funerals but not other life-cycle rituals.
* They substitute for brahmins in post-funeral rites, transferring merit to the deceased through offerings.
* The concept of "transferring merit" allows lay Buddhists to accumulate spiritual capital and benefit from it.
* This practice reflects a more mechanistic understanding of karma compared to the sophisticated interpretations by the Sangha.

## 126 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* The transfer of merit is a complex process where individuals can gain merit by wishing others could benefit from their good deeds.
* This concept connects Buddhism with local communal religions by offering merit to gods in exchange for protection.
* The practice likely emerged around the time of the Buddha's death, coinciding with the increasing monetarization of society.

* In Theravada Buddhism, "meritorious acts" often involve feeding monks and participating in communal religious activities.

## 128 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* Merit-making is central to lay Buddhism, where good deeds lead to a better rebirth and contribute to a virtuous cycle.
* While merit has metaphysical implications, it also brings psychological benefits like generosity, happiness, and peace.
* The virtuous monk inspires faith in the efficacy of the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings).

## B. Secular Power: Asoka

* Emperor Asoka, who ruled most of India in the 3rd century BCE, is a pivotal figure in Buddhist history.
* Asoka's patronage helped spread Buddhism from northern India to become a world religion.
* The wheel on Asoka's pillars symbolizes the Dhamma and adorns the flag of modern India.

## Asoka’S Inscriptions

* Asoka left numerous inscriptions promoting his concept of *dhamma*, which was heavily influenced by Buddhism.
* He renounced violence after a war in Kalinga, embracing righteousness (*dhamma*) as his guiding principle.
* Asoka's *dhamma* encompassed respect for all religions, animal welfare, and social justice.

* He abolished the death penalty, protected animals, and provided public amenities like wells and shade trees.
* Asoka's emphasis on ethical conduct, simplicity, and diligence aligns with Buddhist teachings.
* He believed that true progress in *dhamma* comes from conviction rather than mere rules.
* Some inscriptions explicitly mention Buddhist concepts, confirming Asoka's commitment to Buddhism.

## 132 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* Asoka went on Buddhist pilgrimages, visiting Lumbini and doubling the size of a stupa.
* He issued inscriptions addressed to the Sangha, recommending specific texts for study and outlining punishments for monks who split the Sangha.
* Asoka sent messengers to five kings and several other kingdoms, achieving a *dhamma* victory.

## Asoka In Buddhist Tradition

* The Theravada chronicles portray Asoka as a model ruler who built monasteries and stupas, converted after seeing a tranquil novice monk, and purified the Sangha by expelling pseudo-monks.
* This account is likely an inflation of historical truth but serves to emphasize the importance of the Sangha's purity and the king's role in protecting it.

## The Missions: Interpreting The Evidence

* Theravada chronicles credit elder Tissa Moggaliputta with sending nine missions to spread Buddhism, including one to Ceylon led by Mahinda.
* Archaeological evidence supports parts of this story, but scholars debate whether these missions correspond to Asoka's embassies mentioned in his inscriptions.
* Some argue that Asoka's *dhamma* messengers were not necessarily Buddhist monks and that the destinations and dates do not align with the chronicles.
* Others believe the missions were indeed Asoka's initiative and identify them with the destinations listed in his inscriptions, despite some discrepancies.

## 136 Buddhism And Society In Ancient India

* The text discusses discrepancies between Buddhist sources and inscriptions regarding Asoka's embassies.
* It suggests that Asoka's missions likely included monks from various traditions, not just Theravada Buddhists.
* Tissa Moggaliputta, a prominent Theravada intellectual, is considered to have been exaggerated in his role in spreading Buddhism throughout India.

## The Sinhalese Buddhist Identity

* Sinhalese identity is deeply intertwined with Theravada Buddhism, which has dominated the island's religious and cultural life for centuries.
* Historical invasions from mainland India, primarily Tamil Hindus, contributed to a distinct Sinhalese identity based on language (Sinhala vs. Tamil) and religion (Buddhist vs. Hindu).

## Periodization Of Sinhalese Buddhist History

* Pre-modern Ceylonese history is divided into periods based on the location of the capital city.
* The Sangha, the monastic order, has faced periods of decline due to foreign invasions and internal issues.
* A significant event was the purification of the Sangha in the 12th century by Parakkama Ba¯hu I.
* The Thai mission of 1753 re-established a valid ordination tradition in Ceylon.

## Sources

* **Scriptures, chronicles, and inscriptions are the sources for the history of the Anuradhapura period.** 
    * Inscriptions become important from the Polonnaruva period onwards.
    * Chronicles, especially the *Maha¯vam.* sa ('The Great Chronicle'), are most important.
    * The first part of the *Maha¯vam.* sa was composed in Pali verse in the sixth century by a monk named Maha¯na¯ma.
    * It was modelled on an earlier fourth-century chronicle, the *Dı¯pavam.* sa ('The Island Chronicle').

## Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalism

* **The *Maha¯vam.* sa is the charter of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism.** 
    * It focuses on wars against Tamils during the Polonnaruva period.
    * The identification of religion and nation goes back to the account of King Dut.t.haga¯man.i (101–77 bce).
    * He is depicted as fighting for Buddhism, not just a kingdom.

* **The *Maha¯vam.* sa has exerted a powerful influence on Sinhalese Buddhist identity.** 
    * It provides models of royal behavior, such as Dut.t.haga¯man.i and Parakkama Ba¯hu I and II.
    * These models reinforce stereotypes about Tamils and the role of Buddhism in Sinhalese history.

## Cosmology


* **Traditional Sinhalese Buddhist cosmology is a local variant of Indian Buddhist thought.** 
    * The phenomenal world operates under the aegis of 'our holy king Buddha'.
    * A cosmic hierarchy enforces the Dhamma through delegations of authority.
    * The king occupies a position analogous to Sakka, deriving legitimacy from Buddhism.

* **Religious geography reflects the cosmology and state structure.** 
    * Sixteen sites of Buddhist pilgrimage are distributed across the island.
    * Pilgrimages follow a hierarchical route, mirroring the cosmic order.

## A Buddhist Society

* Sinhalese society was primarily rural and agricultural until the 19th century.
* It consisted of a rice-growing peasantry, craftsmen, service personnel, and the Sangha (Buddhist monastic order).
* There was no indigenous merchant class; foreign traders handled both internal and external trade.
* Buddhism survived in a peasant society that distinguished itself from non-Buddhist traders.

## Worship Of Buddha Images

* The worship of Buddha images in Ceylon draws heavily from South Indian Hindu temple practices, particularly those associated with court ceremonies.
* In the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, the Buddha image is treated like royalty, reflecting the influence of the last South Indian dynasty that ruled there.
* While Buddha images are now mass-produced, they were likely treated with reverence even before modern times.
* The origin of Buddha images is debated, but they have been found in shrines since at least the 4th century CE.
* A central temple image is often upgraded by placing a relic inside during consecration, though this is typically a symbolic relic.
* Consecration involves painting the image's eyes, another Hindu influence.
* While consecrated images are treated with respect and cannot be moved, they are accessible to everyone.
* Traditionally, Buddha images were likely found only in public sacred spaces. The modern proliferation of images is attributed to Christian influence and mass production techniques. 




## Role Of The Village Monk

* A Buddhist temple is primarily the residence of a monk.
* Other objects like a Buddha image, stupa, and Bo tree are added to make it a temple.
* A village monk does not function like a vicar; villagers invite him for mortuary rites.
* His traditional roles are teaching and preaching.

## The Achievements Of Mahinda'S Mission

* Mahinda brought Buddhism to Ceylon with four other monks, a novice, and an *upa¯saka*.
* He converted King Deva¯nam. **piya Tissa** and his entourage through sermons.
* The king donated land for the Maha¯ Viha¯ra, the first monastery in Anuradhapura.
* Mahinda established the first *sı¯ma¯*, the monastic boundary of the Maha¯ Viha¯ra.
* Relics of the Buddha were brought to Ceylon and a stupa was erected.
* The Order of Nuns was established by Asoka's daughter, Sanghamitta¯.
* A branch of the Bo tree under which the Buddha attained Enlightenment was planted in Anuradhapura.



## Establishing Buddhism In A New Country

* Buddhism is primarily a personal religion but requires institutionalization for its survival.
* The Sangha needs material support and recruits, making royal patronage crucial for establishment.
* Missions to courts were a realistic strategy for spreading Buddhism due to the need for large audiences and wealthy patrons.
* Buddhism's success can be attributed to its powerful and beautiful thought, offering a universalistic ethic and path to salvation.

## The Sangha'S Duty To Preserve The Scriptures

* Buddhism relies heavily on the preservation of scriptures, unlike other religions where doctrinal content is minimal among the general population.
* Buddhist ideas are not simple and require an intellectual class for preservation and exposition.
* Sinhalese monks wrote down Buddhist scriptures during a famine in the first century BCE to ensure their survival.
* A conference decided that learning was essential for realizing the Noble Path, emphasizing the importance of preserving knowledge.
* The Sangha formalized roles for monks: "book yoke" (learning and preaching) and "insight yoke" (meditation), highlighting the dual focus on scholarship and practice.

## The Use Of Pali: Buddhaghosa

* Discusses the accessibility of Buddhist texts in ancient Sri Lanka.
* Highlights the role of Pali as a liturgical language and its gradual adoption over Sinhala.
* Explains how Buddhaghosa, an Indian brahmin monk, played a pivotal role in establishing Pali as the dominant language for Theravada Buddhism through his commentaries on scriptures.

## Translation And Popularization

* Explores the history of translating Buddhist scriptures into vernacular languages, particularly Sinhala.
* Notes that translations were primarily intended for monks and not for lay people.
* Suggests that temple murals provide insights into popular religious knowledge among laypeople.

## Village Dweller And Forest Dweller

* Examines the social roles of village-dwelling and forest-dwelling monks in Sri Lanka.
* Discusses the tension between these two monastic lifestyles, reflecting the balance between renunciation and engagement with society.
* Explains how ascetic practices often become institutionalized, leading to a gradual shift back towards mainstream monastic norms.

## The Structure Of The Sangha In Ceylon

* Monks and nuns throughout the Buddhist world are split into lineages called *nika¯yas*, which do not cooperate formally or informally.
* Therava¯din monks share the same *pa¯timokkha* code but may differ in its interpretation or on *vinaya* matters.
* The first recorded split in Therava¯da occurred around the first century BCE, leading to the formation of Abhayagiri and Maha¯ Viha¯ra *nika¯yas*.
* A second split happened in the fourth century CE, resulting in the Jetavana *nika¯ya*.

* While points of doctrine are not relevant to *nika¯ya* differentiation unless they encroach upon the *vinaya*, accusations of unorthodoxy often follow splits.

* From the fourth century until Parakkama Ba¯hu's 'purification' in the twelfth century, there were three main *nika¯yas* in Ceylon, though their reach beyond the capital is unclear.
* Modern Ceylon has three recognized *nika¯yas*, but they are subdivided based on disagreements and geography.

## Formal State Control Of The Sangha

* Parakkama Ba¯hu I established a single authority structure for the national Sangha, abolishing Abhayagiri and Jetavana *nika¯yas* and unifying the remaining monks under the Maha¯ Viha¯ra.
* He issued a royal edict (*ka†aṇavāta*) with the force of *vinaya* regulations and appointed a Sanghara¯ja ('King of the Sangha') to head the Sangha.

* This system, imitated in continental southeast Asia, breaks down if new *nika¯yas* are allowed to form.
* Parakkama Ba¯hu's organization survived theoretically until the fifteenth century but lost practical reality when the Sinhalese state weakened.
* The British government in the nineteenth century allowed separate *nika¯yas*, ending centralized control.

## Sangha And State In Anuradhapura

* Kings of ancient Ceylon saw themselves as responsible for the well-being of the Sangha, similar to the brahmin-ks.atriya relationship in Hindu India.
* There was generally a community of interest between the Sangha and the state, with kings treating the Sangha with deference.
* Many kings followed Asoka's example by working for the public good, building infrastructure and providing social services.

* Some kings aspired to Buddhahood (*bodhisatta*) and dedicated themselves to the welfare of others.
* The *bodhisatta* ideology penetrated Ceylon slowly, becoming prominent only in later centuries.

## The Sangha As Landlords

* Kings contributed to the wealth problem of the Sangha through large-scale land grants and gifts.
* While individual monk ownership of property seems to have started in Ceylon, the law recognizes a difference between property held by the Sangha corporately and that held individually.

##  Land Grants and Economic Transactions

* King Vat.t.aga¯man.i's reign saw a period of rapid change, including land grants to the Sangha, which became frequent after his time.
* Land grants often involved rights to taxes, labor, and proprietary ownership, giving control over the population residing on the land.
* Legal fictions were used to enable the Sangha to deal with property, such as accepting slaves under different names.

## Monastic Landlordism and its Ideological Problems

* Monasteries could own villages, receive labor from inhabitants, and engage in economic transactions like buying land, selling produce, and receiving interest on deposits.
* The Sangha was theoretically prohibited from disposing of property, but this rule was not always followed.
*  Monastic landlordism created ideological problems for the Sangha as it conflicted with the ideal of non-attachment to material possessions.

## The Scale of Monastic Landholdings

* Fa Hsien and Hiuen Tsiang's accounts suggest a significant proportion of Ceylon's population and resources were devoted to Buddhism in ancient times.
* This concentration of wealth and manpower likely posed challenges for kings during wartime.


## Individual Monks and Property

* Despite legal fictions justifying communal involvement with property, individual monks engaged in economic transactions that conflicted with their professed ideals.
* Monks sometimes managed monastic revenue, received "payments" for their work, and inherited personal property from their teachers.
* This inheritance of monastic property profoundly affected the character of the Sangha, leading to a system of incumbency through pupillary succession.

# Decline...

* Monks in Ceylon were settled throughout the countryside, becoming part of village communities.
* This led to monks adopting the values and customs of their fellow villagers.
* The Sangha's life as landowners in peasant communities resulted in caste-based organization within the monastic order.
* Before 1753, there was a decline in true monasticism, with individuals called *gan.inna¯nse¯* taking lower ordination but not necessarily adhering to celibacy or monastic discipline.

# . . . And Revival

* Royal patronage played a crucial role in purifying and reviving the Sangha.
* Kings often intervened to expel offenders and sometimes even reunited fragmented monastic orders.
* The international nature of the Therava¯din tradition allowed Ceylon to re-import ordination traditions from Burma when needed.
* The revival of Buddhism was also fueled by the revival of scriptural knowledge, as seen in the forest hermitage movement.
* Sinhalese public opinion has always held conflicting views about the state of Buddhism, with some believing it is in decline while others maintain its ancient glory.

## The Character Of Sinhalese Buddhist Religiosity

* Some kings offered their kingdoms to the Sangha or relics.
* Others offered themselves and their families as slaves to the Sangha.
* These acts were symbolic gestures of humility combined with extreme munificence.
* There are Hindu parallels to these practices.
* Many instances of royal piety are recorded, such as King Dut.t.haga¯man.i who never ate without offering food to the Sangha.

* Kings showed respect for learned monks, even swallowing pus from a monk's boil.
* These acts suggest that emotional worship and religious self-surrender came early to Therava¯da Buddhism.
* For commoners, the most important feature of Buddhism is its ideal of civilized conduct.
* Robert Knox, an English sailor who lived among the Sinhalese, noted their emphasis on chastity, temperance, and truth.

* The Sangha has experienced a range of lifestyles, from pomp and pelf to humble frugality.
* The duality of purpose - caring for oneself and others - has driven the Sangha's historical development.

## Nineteenth Century: A Watershed in Ceylon Buddhism

* In 1815, the British took control of the whole island, ending the Sinhalese kingdom's two-thousand-year history.
* This marked the first time Buddhism lost its symbolic place at the head of national affairs.
* The Sangha experienced decline due to lack of state support and control.

* Despite this, the population grew significantly, and there were internal reform movements within the Sangha.
* By the end of the century, a new kind of Buddhism emerged in Colombo's middle class.

## Protestant Buddhism: A New Kind of Buddhism

* This new Buddhism is characterized by its emphasis on the laity and the lesser importance it assigns to the Sangha.
* It originated as a protest against Christianity and reflects Protestantism.
* Protestant Buddhists believe all adherents are equally responsible for the religion's welfare.

* Two influences contributed to its creation: Protestant missionaries and socio-economic changes brought about by British rule.
* A new Sinhalese middle class emerged, embracing religious individualism.
* The use of printing and increased reading (especially in English) facilitated this movement.

## The Disestablishment Of The Sangha

* **The traditional identification of the Sangha with the Sinhalese 'establishment' is highlighted by its refusal to ordain anyone not of the top caste in the late eighteenth century.** This practice reinforced the power and prestige held exclusively by the dominant caste.
* However, in maritime provinces under European rule, the dominance of the top caste waned. Lower castes rose in entrepreneurial activity, challenging the established hierarchy.

* **Monks from lower castes sought ordination in Burma, leading to the formation of the Amarapura Nikaya.** This new monastic order obtained official recognition from the British government, marking a significant shift in power dynamics within Buddhism.
* The Amarapura Nikaya's creation was unprecedented as it relied on private citizens and challenged the secular authorities' right to regulate religious affairs.

* **The British initially promised to protect Buddhism upon assuming control of Kandy in 1815.** This promise, however, faced opposition from evangelicals who saw it as incompatible with Christianity.
* **Over time, the British government distanced itself from Buddhism due to missionary pressure.** They stopped signing 'Acts of Appointment' for monastic incumbents, making it difficult for monks to enforce their authority.

* **The withdrawal of government support led to chaos within the Sangha.** Without official recognition, monks had to rely on civil courts to assert their rights, a costly and uncertain process.
* **Although the British government eventually issued 'Certificates' of appointment, these lacked the authority of the previous 'Acts'.** This further weakened the Sangha's ability to control its affairs and enforce discipline.

* **The disestablishment of the Sangha was an unintended consequence of British policies.** It significantly undermined the traditional power and influence of Buddhism in Ceylon.
* The government's relinquishment of custodianship over the Buddha's tooth relic and the construction of an Anglican church next to the Temple of the Tooth symbolized this shift in religious dominance. 




## The British Missions

* The main missionary organizations were established in Ceylon between 1805 and 1818; the most important were those of the Wesleyans (Methodists) and of the Church of England.
* Despite their association with the ruling power, they had limited success converting people to Christianity.
* By 1891, only about 9½ per cent of the population was Christian, with the majority being Roman Catholics converted under Portuguese rule.

## Missionary Methods

* Missionaries propagated Christianity through education, preaching, and pamphleteering.
* Every mission station had a primary school, and the Church of England ran a collegiate institution to train teachers and ordinands.
* The government also controlled some parish schools, which were eventually replaced by a secular Department of Public Instruction in 1869.

* All officially approved schools were Christian and taught in English, making them necessary for government service and advancement.

## Missionary Challenges

* Missionaries faced challenges due to their inflexibility and lack of cultural sensitivity.
* Their insistence on using the pronoun "to¯" in Sinhala translations of the Bible was considered offensive by locals.
* They also engaged in confrontational preaching tactics, ignoring local customs and decorum.

## The Rise of Buddhist Response

* Initially, Buddhists responded to missionary activity with tolerance and even cooperation.
* However, this changed in the mid-19th century as missionaries became more aggressive in their proselytizing efforts.
* In 1863, Methodist missionary Spence Hardy expressed confidence that Buddhism would be defeated.

## Buddhist Counterarguments

* The publication of Kristiya¯ni Prajñapti (The Evidences and Doctrines of the Christian Religion) by Daniel Gogerly in 1849 marked a turning point.
* This work, which compared Buddhist and Christian doctrine, appealed to reason rather than emotion.
* It prompted Buddhists to engage more directly with missionary arguments and defend their own beliefs.

## Early Buddhist Reactions

* Theravada Buddhists initially resisted printing scriptures.
* The first Buddhist press was established in Colombo by Anglican missionaries in 1823.
* Two monks, Hikkaduve Sumangala and Mohottivate Gunananda, spearheaded the Buddhist response to Christian missionary activity.
* Public debates between Buddhists and Christians began in 1864, with Gunananda playing a leading role for the Buddhists.

## The Rise Of The Buddhist Laity

* Protestant Buddhism emphasized the importance of the laity in religious affairs.
* Lay Buddhists played a crucial role in establishing schools and printing presses, which helped create a literate lay public.
* Vidyodaya Pirivena, a Buddhist college founded in 1873, was instrumental in promoting Buddhist education among both clergy and laity.
* The rise of Buddhist colleges like Vidyodaya Pirivena led to the emergence of Protestant Buddhism, which influenced mainstream Buddhism through its educated clergy.

## The Impact Of The Theosophists

* The Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, with headquarters moving to Adyar, near Madras, in 1879.
* Bishop Copleston expressed concern about the Theosophists' engagement with Buddhism in Ceylon.

* Olcott and Blavatsky arrived in Ceylon in 1890 and embraced Buddhism.
* Olcott aimed to establish a branch of the Theosophical Society in Ceylon, but it was the Buddhist Theosophical Society (BTS) that thrived.
* Olcott's *Buddhist Catechism*, published in 1881, outlined his vision for a unified global Buddhism and is considered a key text in the modern Buddhist movement.

* Olcott introduced several Western elements into Ceylon Buddhism, including the Buddhist flag, Wesak carols, and Wesak cards.
* The Buddhists trusted Olcott deeply, appointing him their representative to the Colonial Office in 1884.

* Tensions arose between Olcott and some Sinhalese Buddhist leaders like Gun. **a¯nanda who felt that the BTS was becoming too influenced by Hinduism.
* Olcott played a significant role in establishing Buddhist schools in Ceylon, which were modeled after missionary schools and emphasized English education.

* The success of BTS schools led to the proliferation of lay Buddhist organizations, such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA), which became a prominent force in Ceylon Buddhism.
* Laymen also began to play a more active role in managing the Sangha's temporalities, leading to ongoing discussions and investigations into this issue.





## Anaga¯Rika Dharmapa¯la

* Born in 1864 as Don David Hewavitarne.
* Became known as Anaga¯rika Dharmapa¯la, meaning 'Protector of the Dhamma'.
* Considered a national hero of Sri Lanka.

## His Early Life and Influences

* Grew up in a rising middle-class family in Colombo.
* Received education at Roman Catholic and Anglican schools.
* Developed a strong dislike for Christianity due to his experiences at school.

## Involvement with Buddhism and Theosophy

* Heard the Panadura debate and met Mohot.t.ivatte Gun. **a¯nanda in 1878.
* Met Olcott in 1880 and worked for the lay BTS until 1898.
* Visited Adyar with Madame Blavatsky in 1884.

## The Maha Bodhi Society and Buddhist Nationalism

* Founded the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 to reclaim Bodh Gaya¯ for Buddhists.
* Moved the headquarters of the society to Calcutta in 1892.
* Aimed to unite and activate Buddhists worldwide.

## Dharmapa¯la's Role at the World Parliament of Religions

* Represented Buddhism at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893.
* Made less impact than Swami Vivekananda, who represented Hinduism.

## Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalism

* Founded a nationalist newspaper called Sim. *hala* Bauddhaya¯ ('The Sinhalese Buddhist') in 1906.
* Idealized the pre-colonial past and used Christian rhetoric to promote his ideas.

## Lay Meditation

* Rediscovered a text on meditation in an old temple in 1890.
* Became the first known Buddhist to learn meditation from a book without a master.
* Popularized lay meditation among the bourgeoisie of Colombo and Rangoon.

## Lay Religious Activism

* Dharmapa¯la created a new status called Anaga¯rika, halfway between monk and layman, embodying a commitment to Buddhism without renouncing worldly activity. 
* He took the Eight Precepts for life and promoted the Sa¯sana (Buddhist teachings) and general welfare of Buddhists.
* This status was inspired by Christian criticisms of monks as selfish.

## Protestant Buddhist Ethos

* The influence of Christianity is evident in the active roles Buddhist monks now play, similar to Christian clergymen, engaging in social welfare, missionary work, and even serving as chaplains.
* Lay Buddhists are also actively involved, not just supporting the clergy but participating in doctrinal debates.
* This shift mirrors the Protestant revolution in Christianity, driven by urbanization and a rising bourgeoisie seeking to break the religious monopoly of the priestly class (in this case, Buddhist monks).

##  Protestant Values and Social Change

* Dharmapa¯la promoted "this-worldly asceticism," emphasizing values like honesty, diligence, and thrift, similar to Calvinism.
* He published a pamphlet, *Gihi Vinaya*, applying Protestant values to daily life, advocating for Western etiquette and morality.
* This led to the adoption of monogamy as the norm among the Sinhalese bourgeoisie, mistakenly believing it to be the traditional norm.

## Religious Egalitarianism

* Dharmapa¯la embraced the Protestant view of religious egalitarianism, believing Buddhist soteriological doctrine and activity were applicable to everyone.
* He saw communal religion practiced by Sinhalese as influenced by Hinduism and advocated for a universal approach to Buddhism.

## Other Characteristics Of Protestant Buddhism

* Protestant Buddhism tends towards fundamentalism, rejecting tradition.
* It claims Buddhism is "scientific," "rational," and "not a religion."
* It relies heavily on English concepts even when expressed in Sinhala.
* This blend of characteristics stems from Protestant missionaries, their opponents' arguments, and western scholarship making Pali texts accessible.

## Limited Scope Of Protestant Buddhism

* Protestant Buddhism, exemplified by Dharmapa¯la, emerged during British rule in Ceylon.
* It divided the Sinhalese population into an English-educated middle class and a traditional peasantry.
* The Sangha remained largely rural, with limited exposure to lay intellectuals' ideas.
* While some monks embraced modern education and social responsibility, many returned to traditional village life.

## 8 Current Trends, New Problems

* Dharmapa¯la's polemical rhetoric has faded, but the idea of Buddhism as purely rational or scientific persists.
* The perception of Buddhism as unique has been replaced by its categorization as one religion among others in Sri Lanka.
* There is a recurring claim that Buddhism is distinct from other religions, offering a unique path to salvation.

## The New Ethos

* Dharmapa¯la's rejection of gods and traditional communal religion is largely absent today.
* A sense of guilt persists among some regarding belief in gods or demons.
* Lay religiosity remains central, emphasizing individual pursuit of *nibba¯na* and spreading Buddhism through society.
* This new ethos aligns with the view of Buddhism as a total religious system comparable to other religions.
* Meditation is seen as appropriate for everyone, regardless of status.




## 198 Current Trends, New Problems

* Protestant Buddhists do not display their wealth as proof of righteousness; rather they act as if they were atoning by this piety for their excessive worldliness.

## Unintended Consequences Of Lay Religious Activism

* Lay leadership in Buddhism has the same effect as in Protestant Christianity: sect formation.
* These sects claim not to be deviant from the main tradition but on the contrary to be the *true* Buddhists.
* They believe that the degenerate Sangha have lost the way, and they are tolerant towards other religious traditions.

## Recent Economic And Social Developments

* The population explosion in Sri Lanka has almost destroyed the traditional village community.
* Many people have migrated to other villages, new irrigation schemes, or cities like Colombo.

## 200 Current Trends, New Problems

* A vast new socio-economic class of poor people living in and around the cities has emerged.
* Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism has been nurtured by politicians who blame the Tamils for economic backwardness.


## The Cultural Eff**Ect Of The War**

* A civil war between the mainly Sinhalese government and Tamil extremists has ravaged the country.
* Some monks have justified nationalist elements, composing battle songs that equate defending the motherland with reaching nirvana.
* The civil war has accentuated the wish in some elements of the Sangha to get involved in worldly affairs and even take leadership roles previously reserved for laymen.

## 202 Current Trends, New Problems

* In Sri Lanka, monks are increasingly entering politics, leading to tensions between religious and secular authority.
* The rise of English-language education highlights the tension between traditional Sinhalese culture and global economic forces.
* Some intellectuals advocate for a return to "mother tongue" ideology, but this is seen as shortsighted by many.

## Hinduizing Trends

* Despite being a Buddhist country, Sri Lanka is experiencing a wave of Hinduization, particularly among urbanites.
* Traditional Sinhalese deities are losing popularity to more powerful and fearsome Hindu gods like Kali.
* Religious practices are becoming less rational and more focused on ecstatic devotion, possession, and the occult.

## The Decline Of Rationality

* There is a growing interest in the occult, including palmistry, table-tapping, hypnotism, and astrology.
* This trend reflects widespread anxiety and a lack of faith in traditional religious authorities.
* Even Buddhist monks are increasingly consulting astrologers for guidance on both this life and the afterlife.

## The Crisis Of Authority

* The breakdown of traditional authority structures has led to a decline in the Sangha's influence over spiritual matters.
* Many Sinhalese, particularly professionals and intellectuals, are seeking religious guidance from lay teachers or even Indian gurus.
* This trend reflects a broader societal shift towards individualism and a "religion of choice."

## Altered States Of Consciousness

* Meditation has become a popular leisure activity among the middle classes, reflecting a growing interest in altered states of consciousness. 


## 206 Current Trends, New Problems

* Some people are attempting meditation without proper guidance, leading to potentially harmful results.
* Individuals may misinterpret altered states of consciousness achieved through meditation, confusing experiences like possession with Buddhist *jha¯na*.
* Using meditation for "welfare work" or personal gain is a new trend that deviates from traditional Buddhist practices.

## Using Buddhism For This World

* Urban and suburban Sinhalese are increasingly using meditation for daily life efficiency rather than as a spiritual pursuit.
* Adapting Buddhist meditation to secular purposes can create conflict between worldly desires and Buddhist values of detachment.
* Modern Sinhalese are incorporating Buddhist elements into weddings, reflecting a trend towards "Buddhicizing" secular events.

## Developments In The Sangha

* The Sangha lacks central authority and has not responded cohesively to these changes.

## 208 Current Trends, New Problems

* Despite challenges, there have been positive developments within the traditional Sangha, such as the hermitage movement and innovative public worship practices.
* Monastic recruitment is primarily from rural backgrounds, limiting intellectual diversity within the Sangha.
* The re-establishment of the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka is a significant development driven by globalization and women's empowerment.

## The Challenge

* The decline of village communities weakens the traditional role of monks as religious leaders.
* To retain its best members, the Sangha needs to offer more engaging career paths.
* State patronage can help ensure the future of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. 




## 210 Current Trends, New Problems

* The Sangha's autonomy will not guarantee its influence over Buddhists.
* To reach a wider audience, the Sangha needs to utilize mass media and increase its presence in urban areas.
* While radio broadcasts can spread Buddhist teachings, secular trends pose a challenge.
* Television offers a powerful tool for the Sangha to connect with people.
