# The Mystique Of The Abhidhamma

* The author introduces the topic of the abhidhamma with a humorous anecdote.
* They express trepidation about approaching the subject due to its perceived complexity and mystery.
* The essay aims to propose a new theory about the role of the abhidhamma, focusing on its take on fundamental philosophical concepts like being and time.

## 1 In The Beginning …

* The author uses an analogy of a journey through time to explore the development of human understanding of time and death.
* They trace the evolution of religious thought from early agricultural societies to the emergence of Buddhism.
* The concept of rebirth is presented as a response to the fear of death, drawing parallels with agricultural practices and beliefs about sowing seeds for future harvests.

* The author highlights the Buddha's unique perspective on time, emphasizing his focus on ending the cycle of birth, aging, and death.
* They argue that the Buddha's teachings prioritize liberation from suffering caused by rebirth over addressing everyday sorrows.
* The analysis of the first three sermons suggests that the Buddha's audience understood time primarily in terms of cycles of birth and death.



# Impermanence

*  The concept of impermanence is explored as a broader treatment of time.
* Birth, aging, and death are presented as paradigms for understanding time in different contexts.
* The text questions whether impermanence equates to suffering or pleasure, concluding that it leads to suffering due to the association with birth, aging, and death.

# Physical Form and Self

*  Physical form is analyzed in relation to the concept of self (anatta).
* It is concluded that physical form, being impermanent, cannot be considered an immortal soul.
* The text encourages viewing all physical forms with "right understanding" as not-self, encompassing past, present, future, internal and external aspects.

# Defilements and Enlightenment

*  Abandoning defilements is presented as a result of seeing physical form as not-self.
* This insight into rebirth is linked to the concept of "learned noble disciple" and "right wisdom in accordance with reality."
* The experience of enlightenment is described as the cessation of birth.

# Time and Psychology

*  The third sermon introduces a psychological treatment of time through the six senses.
* Feeling is presented as arising dependent on contact, shifting focus from rebirth to present-moment experience.
* A strong emphasis is placed on the "burning" nature of existence due to attachment and defilements.

# Dependent Origination

* The concept of dependent origination is introduced as a framework for understanding rebirth without a soul.
* This psychological analysis connects to the cycle of rebirth, with the twelve links serving as a consistent explanation.

# Evolution of Time in Abhidhamma

*  The abhidhamma literature evolves from the suttas' eschatological focus to a more psychologized perspective on time.
* The "one lifetime dependent origination" emerges, emphasizing present-moment experience over rebirth.

# Dhammasaṅgaṇī and Time

* The Dhammasaṅgaṇī simplifies the concept of time to "on that occasion," allowing for various interpretations.
* This vagueness reflects a universalist agenda but contradicts the suttas' specific focus on time.

# Mind-Moment Theory

*  The later abhidhamma introduces the mind-moment theory, proposing that time is composed of discrete, indivisible units.
* This theory impacts the understanding of impermanence, samadhi, and the path to enlightenment.

# Critique of Mind-Moment Theory

* The mind-moment theory is critiqued for its implausibility and reductionist nature.
* It is argued that a static view of the mind fails to capture the dynamic process of experience.

# Several, perhaps all, of these supposed functions of the mind-moment

* The functions ascribed to 'mind-moments' overlap with those of 'name' or 'mental factors'.
* These functions are considered universal assistants to cognition and also specific to certain types of cognition.
* The abhidhamma struggles to distinguish between cognition and mental factors, often conflating them when discussing cognition.

# Just what is going on here?

* The shift from empirical to metaphysical discourse in the abhidhamma creates pseudo-problems.
* Suttas focus on practical experience and solutions to suffering, while abhidhamma seeks to describe all of existence.
* This objectification leads to imposing concepts onto reality, prioritizing definitions over lived experience.

# Find this hard to swallow?

* The orthodox view in some abhidhamma circles is that 'mind-moments' are only directly observable by Buddhas and chief disciples.
* Some challenge this, claiming they can be seen through meditation, similar to claims of seeing God or the universal Self in other traditions.
* This controversy highlights the departure from the Buddha's pragmatic empiricism.

# No aspect of the abhidhamma speaks so eloquently of the dismissal of experience as the treatment of feeling

* The abhidhamma associates 'wholesome consciousness' with pleasure or equanimity, contradicting suttas that describe painful experiences while acting wholesomely.
* This stems from prioritizing the ethical quality of cognition over intention, leading to discomfort acknowledging painful 'wholesome consciousness'.
* Suttas emphasize intention as the source of wholesomeness, allowing for future happiness even amidst present suffering.

# A similar point can be made with reference to the abhidhamma's strange analysis of the kinds of feeling associated with the six kinds of sense cognition

* The abhidhamma claims feelings associated with sight, hearing, smell, and taste are neutral, implying beauty and taste depend solely on happiness.
* This contradicts lived experience where individuals can find things pleasurable or unpleasant regardless of their emotional state.
* Again, this doctrine clashes with suttas that acknowledge all three types of feeling (pleasant, painful, neutral) arising from sense stimuli.



## 2 …There Was …

* The suttas define 'existence' (bhava) primarily as 'states of rebirth'.
* This section explores 'being' from a psychological perspective through the term 'nāmarūpa', meaning 'name & form'.
* While nāmarūpa is linked to the phenomenal world and the concept of multiplicity, Buddhism views it as subject to change and suffering.

## The Ending of Name & Form

* This section contrasts pre-Buddhist and Buddhist perspectives on liberation.
* Pre-Buddhist traditions sought liberation through dissolving nāmarūpa in consciousness (*vijñāna*).
* The Buddha taught that even consciousness is bound to nāmarūpa, leading to infinite suffering.

## Dependent Origination and Nāmarūpa

* This section analyzes nāmarūpa within the framework of dependent origination.
* 'Name' is associated with mental functions (labeling contact), while 'form' relates to physical phenomena (impact contact).

## Contact and Cognition

* The passage from the Mahā Nidāna Sutta highlights the interdependence of name and form in cognition.
*  'Mano' is identified as a mental construct that enables mental cognition, similar to 'name'.
* Both 'impact contact' and 'labeling contact' are essential for complete 'contact'.

## Implications for Ontology

* The passage emphasizes the inseparability of conceptualization from phenomena themselves.
* 'Properties' by which we conceptualize things are functionally equivalent to the things themselves in dependent origination.
* Wisdom lies not in transcending concepts but in understanding their inherent role in cognition.

# Bhikkhu Bodhi's Interpretation

* Bhikkhu Bodhi interprets the mention of 'properties' as implying a distinction between things and their conceptual representations.
* He supports this view by referencing commentaries on the three 'ways' of speech, claiming that 'speech' refers to conceptual description while the 'way' of speech refers to the objective referent (five aggregates).

# The Three "Ways" of Speech

* The phrase "three ways of speech" in the Khandha Saṁyutta actually refers to past, present, and future tenses.
* This highlights the importance of time and rebirth in understanding Buddhist teachings, especially in Pali, a heavily inflected language.

# Ultimate vs. Conventional Truth

* Understanding the difference between 'ultimate' and 'conventional' truth was considered a sign of wisdom in Buddhism.
* However, this distinction can be seen as a form of jargon that is taken too seriously.
* Throughout Buddhist history, the concept has been used to elevate one's own teachings while denigrating others.

# Abhidhamma and Conventional Truth

* The Abhidhamma Piṭaka claims to present 'ultimate truth', but it also contains discussions on 'conventional' topics.
* The Puggala Paññatti lists six concepts, including aggregates, sense media, elements, truths, faculties, and persons.
* This suggests that the Abhidhamma doesn't privilege aggregates with a special ontological status above the concept of 'person'.

# Epistemology of Ultimate Truth

* Later abhidhammikas proposed that conventional truth is known through inference while ultimate truth is known through direct perception.
* They claimed that *vipassanā* deals with ultimate truth, while *samatha* deals with conventional truth.
* However, this theory can be refuted by examining how 'direct knowledge' and 'inferential knowledge' are treated in the Nidāna Saṁyutta.

# Name and Form: A Shifting Definition

* In the Mahā Nidāna Sutta, name and form are called 'name group' and 'form group', implying multiple factors within each.
* Elsewhere, name is defined as feeling, perception, attention, contact, and volition, while form includes physical properties and derived forms.
* The connection between name and its original meaning weakens over time, becoming an umbrella term for mental functions, some directly associated with conceptualizing.

# Name in Abhidhamma

* By the time of the abhidhamma, 'name' expands to encompass all mental phenomena, including cognition, which was excluded in the suttas.
* This expansion is justified by a spurious connection with the verb 'to bend', suggesting cognition bends towards its objects.
* Consequently, 'name & form' becomes translated as 'mind and body', the 'ultimate reality'.

# Chariot Simile: A Misinterpretation?

* The chariot simile illustrates that the word 'chariot' is a convention used when parts come together, just like the word 'self' arises when five aggregates are present.
* The simile doesn't imply that parts are more 'ultimate' than the whole or that reducing the chariot to 'ultimate' parts is beneficial.

# Reductionism and Abhidhamma

* The abhidhamma adopts a reductionist approach, breaking down phenomena into their smallest components.
* Each *kalapa*, the ultimate unit of matter, has its own color, taste, smell, and nutriment.
* This kind of analysis oversimplifies reality and lacks empirical support.

# Jain Animism Parallels

* The abhidhamma's reductionist approach resembles Jain animism, which sees existence as composed of atoms (*paramāṇu*) that are also 'persons' (*pudgala*).
* These elemental souls possess color, odor, and taste, with human souls being an advanced version.




# The Problem with Sabhāvas

* The Abhidhamma defines phenomena (*dhamma*) by their intrinsic essence (*sabhāva*), which is said to be the same as the *dhamma*.
* This concept of *sabhāvas* has been criticized for being metaphysical and obscuring the true nature of reality.

# Mind-Moments and Entities

* Some modern abhidhammikas argue that mind moments are 'acts' or 'events', not entities.
* However, the Abhidhamma often speaks of mind-moments as entities performing functions, suggesting an inconsistency in their approach.

# The Analytic/Synthetic Method

* The Dhammasaṅgaṇī and the Paṭṭhāna, two main books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, analyze and categorize *dhammas* and explore their relationships.
* This method has been compared to the creation story in Genesis, leading to a mind-body dualism similar to that found in other religions.

# The Problem of Rebirth

* The Paṭṭhāna attempts to explain how mind and body are connected through its 'dissociation condition', but this concept is ultimately unsatisfactory.
* This dualistic view of mind and body makes it difficult for Buddhists to respond to scientific critiques of religious concepts like life after death.

# Sabhāvas and Suffering

* The doctrine of *sabhāvas* posits that Nibbana, the state of enlightenment, is 'self-existent', similar to *saṁsāra*.
* This raises the question of whether *sabhāvatā*, 'self-existingness', is part of suffering.
* If it is, then Nibbana would also partake of suffering, which contradicts Buddhist teachings.

# The Limitations of Sabhāvas

* The doctrine of *sabhāvas* fails to draw a clear distinction between suffering and true happiness.
* It therefore cannot effectively guide us towards spiritual liberation.

# So this metaphysical conception of 'being' in terms of sabhava is the culprit for the near-universal misconception of Nibbana as a kind of metaphysical Absolute

* The concept of *sabhāva*, which posits a sphere of 'being' divorced from conditions, leads to misconceptions about Nibbana.
* This metaphysical view is incompatible with Buddhist suttas, which emphasize empirical reality rather than abstract definitions.

# It is very true that the suttas emphatically affirm the reality of Nibbana; but reality in the suttas is in no sense and no way conceived in metaphysical terms

* Suttas affirm the reality of cessation (Nibbana) without metaphysical implications.
* Nibbana exists like empirical realities, not as a fantasy or illusion.

# The concept of *sabhāva*, then, clearly posits a sphere of 'being' divorced from conditions - and this is just what I mean by 'metaphysics'

*  *Sabhāva* represents a metaphysical view that creates a "shadow world" of abstract definitions presented as ultimate reality.

# Perhaps, gentle reader, you think I'm going over the top

* The Visuddhimagga, a key Abhidhamma text, exemplifies this metaphysical tendency by asserting Pali as the root language of all languages, hardwired into reality.
* This reflects an influence from Brahmanical theories that saw Vedic language as emanating from Being itself.

# The fallacy of the theory of *sabhāvas*, just as with the theory of moments, lies in reading the connotations of our terms for reality into reality itself; that is, in assuming that reality reflects its conceptual description

* The mistake lies in assuming reality mirrors our conceptual descriptions, like assuming "breath" implies an immaterial soul.
* This error replicates itself even as concepts become more refined.

# In just the same way, as the word 'contact' is independent from the word 'feeling', we assume that the *sabhāva* of contact is independent from the sabhāva of feeling

* The Abhidhammikas, like those who believe in a self, project objectivity onto concepts, assuming *sabhāvas* exist objectively in reality.
* This leads to a hidden doctrine of self, as ancient thinkers pointed out.

# This is why the ancients unequivocally declared that the doctrine of *sabhāvas* amounts to nothing but a hidden doctrine of self



* The Bhagavad-Gita explicitly links *sabhāva* with the Self, highlighting this connection.
* Our conceptual apparatus shapes our experience of reality, and the only "ultimate reality" beyond concepts is Nibbana – the cessation of consciousness.

## 3 …The Word.

* The text begins by criticizing the foundations of abhidhamma, comparing its collapse to the destruction of the World Trade Center and Titanic.

* A story is told about a grieving mother who seeks solace from a priest who explains death through the concept of a "little man" residing in the chest. This illustrates how people often seek comfort in simplistic explanations for complex phenomena.

* The author argues that such theories, while comforting, are ultimately meaningless and philosophically useless. They shift the focus away from empirical reality into metaphysics, creating a world of abstractions divorced from nature.

* To maintain their authority, these theories become increasingly abstract and mystified, relying on archaic authorization and ancient texts to create an illusion of unquestionable wisdom.

* The author suggests that abhidhamma should be understood as a mystical cult rather than a psychology or philosophy. Its complexity arises from the need to create an impression of authority, with its specialists acting as intermediaries between devotees and ultimate reality.


* The myth of the Buddha teaching abhidhamma in heaven is analyzed as a testament to the gullibility needed to accept such teachings.

* The author connects the myth to the concept of Māyā, the mother goddess representing illusion. He suggests that the resurrection of Māyā in the abhidhamma legend symbolizes the re-emergence of the very illusion it seeks to dispel.

* Ultimately, the author aims to demystify abhidhamma and encourage a more critical examination of its teachings.
