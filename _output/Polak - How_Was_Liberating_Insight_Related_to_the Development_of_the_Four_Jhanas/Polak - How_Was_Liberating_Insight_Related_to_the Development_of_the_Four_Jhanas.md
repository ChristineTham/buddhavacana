# How Was Liberating Insight Related To The Development Of The Four Jhānas In Early Buddhism? A New Perspective Through An Interdisciplinary Approach

* This paper presents a model of liberating insight as an intrinsic quality of the *jhāna* meditative state through an interdisciplinary approach.
* It analyzes various concepts of liberating insight in the *Suttapiṭaka* and their connection to the development of the four *jhāna-s*. 
* The paper points out fundamental difficulties connected with the traditional Buddhist model of insight as a separate meditative method distinct from *jhāna*.

# The Precise Nature and Status of *Jhāna* Meditation in Early Buddhist Soteriology

* This remains one of the most controversial subjects of early Buddhist studies.
* There are unclear issues regarding the relation between *jhāna* meditation and liberating insight.

# Liberating Insight: A Multifaceted Concept

* The term "liberating insight" is used by modern scholars with reference to several Pāli terms (e.g., paññā, *aññā, ñāṇadassana*, *abhiññā,* vipassanā).
* Its meaning varies depending on the context in which it appears.

* In this paper, "liberating insight" is understood as a cognitive act leading to seeing things as they really are, resulting in transformation and certainty of liberation.

# Discrepancies Regarding Liberating Insight

* There are fundamental discrepancies regarding liberating insight in the *Suttapiṭaka* and later Buddhist texts.
* These discrepancies are sometimes difficult or impossible to reconcile.

# The Scheme of Liberation: Insight in the Fourth Jhāna

* A scheme where liberating insight occurs in the fourth *jhāna* by directing the mind towards destroying effluents (*āsava*) has been studied extensively.
* This scheme involves insight into the four noble truths and later applies the same model to *āsava-s*.

# Challenges to the Traditional Scheme

* The consensus is that this complicated scheme cannot represent the original account of enlightenment.
* Knowledge of the four noble truths, while authentic, seems misplaced in this context.
* Schmithausen notes the psychological implausibility of insight into the four noble truths ending desire.
* Bronkhorst argues that knowledge of the four noble truths is useful for someone beginning the path but not for someone at its end.

# Right View and the Noble Eightfold Path

* Right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*), defined as knowledge of the four noble truths, occupies a specific place in the noble eightfold path.
* The *Vibhaṅga Sutta* explicitly states that right view is knowledge of suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path leading to cessation.

# A Gradual Development of Factors

* There are reasons to believe that the noble eightfold path may have represented factors developed gradually.
* The order of these factors would correspond to their development sequence.




# Liberating Insight in Early Buddhism

* The text discusses different concepts of liberating insight in early Buddhism.
* Some texts describe a direct, immediate knowledge of liberation upon awakening.
* This knowledge is characterized by terms like *ñāṇa*, *dassana*, and an aorist of *abhijānāti*.
* These formulas express certitude but don't detail the content of the liberating truth.

# Insight Connected with Jhāna Practice

* Another concept links liberating insight to the practice of the four *jhāna*-s.
* In this view, imperfections within the jhānic states become the object of insight.
* The *Jhāna Sutta* suggests that while absorbed in any *jhāna*, one should reflect on the impermanent, painful, and non-self nature of these states.

# Later Developments: Opapātika and Implausibility

* This concept of insight based on jhānic imperfections seems to be a later development.
* The introduction of the *opapātika* (spontaneously reborn being) concept might reflect growing uncertainty about achieving final liberation in this life.
* Some scholars argue that insight requiring investigation is implausible while absorbed in *jhāna*.

# Psychological Considerations and Modern Perspectives

* Ajahn Brahm, a modern meditation master, describes *jhāna* as a state where control, decision-making, and comprehension are absent.
* This raises questions about the plausibility of practicing insight into jhānic imperfections while simultaneously immersed in *jhāna*.
* The *Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta* states that intentions cease in the first two *jhāna*-s, making it impossible to initiate a new practice within them.

# Insight Beyond Jhāna

* Several *sutta*s describe liberating insight without mentioning *jhāna*.
* In these texts, liberation arises from seeing the body/mind complex as impermanent, stressful, and non-self.





## just as it is (*yathābhūtaṃ*)

* This is not mine (*n' etaṃ mama***), this I am not** (*n' eso 'ham asmi*), this is not my self (*na m' eso attā***).
* This leads to weariness/** disenchantment (*nibbidā*), dispassion (*virāga*) and liberation (*vimutti*).

## 13 Several different Buddhist theoretical schemes of body/mind complex may be used in this context

* These include the four or six elements (*dhātu - e.g.* the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta MN 140/III 237), sense bases (*āyatana* - e.g. the *Mahāsaḷāyatanika Sutta* MN 149/III 287), khandha-s (*Khandha Saṃyutta -* **SN 22/III 1),** or simply feelings (vedanā - *Vedanā Saṃyutta* **SN 36/IV204).**
* Many of these accounts do not seem to serve well either as instructions for practice or as verbalizations of the immediate experience representing the supposed content of the liberating insight.

## Of course this statement does not constitute a conclusive argument in itself, but is nonetheless worth taking into consideration

* There is also a second very serious psychological problem connected with insight meditation which is deliberately practised through the active applying of categories and active analysis.
* While it attempts to provide a clear view of the mind-body complex as it really is here and now, it fails to become aware that the very mental activity of performing insight -- understood as: "deliberate analysis", "applying categories", "maintaining active consciousness" -- is in itself an important mental process which constitutes an essential part of our very being/selfhood in the moment.

## Perhaps something else was however meant by the descriptions, such as the above mentioned one from the *Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta***

* Perhaps it is simply a very speciic way of saying that a meditator directly knows and sees his body (*kāya***) as it really is.
* Then one of the several theoretical schemes used to analyze the body into several components is applied, like that of dhātu-s, āyatana-s*, khandha-*s or simply feelings (*vedanā***).

## So we can see problems with concepts of insight knowledge and insight practice in themselves and with their connection to *jhāna* meditation on both the textual and the practical, psychological level

* The psychological implausibility connected with these concepts may be an important hint suggesting that their very presence in the *sutta***s is in fact a result of doctrinal polemics, shifts and evolution and not of real life practice.
* Alexander Wynne has suggested in *The Origin of Buddhist Meditation* **that** at some point: The scheme of jhānas became a support for different versions of intellectual insight; meditation became the means for an increasingly elaborate set of mental gymnastics (Wynne, 2007: 124).

## Therefore let us now turn for help to modern cognitive science

* If the original concept of liberating insight was indeed based on real life experience and thus on actual human cognitive processes, the results of this dynamically developing discipline may shed some important light on our problem.
* Liberating insight is supposed to be a special kind of understanding bringing transformative knowledge. But what is the real cognitive mechanism of insight? Where does it take place?

## In the stereotypical concept of Buddhist insight we ind some implicit preconceptions which seem to be rooted in our ordinary, common sense way of thinking

* Let's take for example this deinition by Gunaratana: Insight meditation requires investigation and observation (Gunaratana, 1985: 151).
* Or by Grifiths, from his paper: **Concentration or Insight: The Problematic** of Theravāda Buddhist Meditation: Wisdom is a type of […] discursive knowledge and vision. The means used to achieve this kind of conscious awareness is a continuous attempt to internalize the categories of Buddhist metaphysics (Grifiths, 1981: 613).

## There is nothing particularly controversial or unique about these deinitions, as they represent a fairly stereotypical approach to insight, quite popular in Buddhism

* They are based on a common sense, widely accepted notion of "understanding" as a deliberately undertaken mental activity which takes place in a ield of consciousness.
* This understanding results in obtaining declarative knowledge of explicit character - the liberating knowledge which is so problematic in the *sutta***s.




# Conscious Thought Does Not Exist

* Conscious thought happens unconsciously.
* We are aware of some elements or products of thought, but not thought itself.
* Our senses process far more information than our consciousness can handle.
* Unconscious mechanisms handle the majority of information processing.

# Buddhist Insight and Cognitive Science

* Buddhist insight was concerned with unaltered awareness of sense input.
* Modern cognitive science suggests limitations to conscious awareness in interpreting data.
*  Buddhist thought seems against a conscious self, but its concept of insight relies on "folk psychology."

# Implicit Insights

* Professor Ran R. Hassin's research suggests insights occur without conscious awareness.
* These insights can manifest in behavior without conscious awareness or intention.
* This aligns with the idea of unspecifiable liberating knowledge in early Buddhism.

# Liberating Insight and Meditation

* Early Buddhist texts suggest liberating insight was unspecified and unspecifiable.
* Implicit insights, occurring without conscious effort, align with the spontaneous nature of an arahant.
* The unintentional nature of implicit insights solves problems related to deliberate insight practice during jhana states.

# Psychological Plausibility of Liberating Insight

*  Liberating insight should be a psychologically plausible process.
* It shouldn't require deliberate practice and should harmonize with states like the fourth jhana.
* Theories of "implicit insight" or "cognitive unconscious" offer promising perspectives on early Buddhist liberating insight.

# Reinterpretations of Jhāna States

* Early Buddhist texts describe psychological states unusual from a common-sense perspective but not conflicting with natural science or psychology.
* Later Buddhists may have misinterpreted the original doctrine due to external influences and a misunderstanding of implicit insight.
* The terms used to describe jhana states, like sati, sampajana, and upekkha, might refer to a particular way of perceiving sense objects rather than concentrated awareness.

# Jhāna States as Sense-Inactive?

* The Indriyabhavana Sutta critiques meditative practices leading to sense shutdown.
* It suggests a state described by the same terms as the third jhana, involving equanimity, mindfulness, and clear comprehension while avoiding agreeable and disagreeable experiences.
* This challenges the view of jhana states as purely sense-inactive and mentally static.

# Jhāna States and Sense Experience

* The Maha-tanha-sankhaya Sutta suggests that after attaining the fourth jhana, a meditator dwells with each sense registering its objects, mindfulness of the body established, and an immeasurable mind.
* This further supports the idea that jhana states were not necessarily characterized by complete sensory withdrawal.

# The Nature of Insight in Early Buddhist Jhāna

* Early Buddhist texts suggest that jhāna is a state characterized by profound cognitive effects, leading to spontaneous insight.
* This insight arises naturally from the purified mind achieved through jhāna practice, without conscious effort or analysis.
* The *Cetanākaraṇīya Sutta* emphasizes that no intention should be made during concentrated states, as true insight arises spontaneously.

# Spontaneous Insight and Liberation

* The process of attaining liberation through jhāna involves a natural progression from weariness/disenchantment to dispassion, cessation, and finally, liberation.
* The *Sekha Sutta* compares the attainment of liberation to a chick breaking out of an egg, highlighting the effortless nature of this process.
* This type of insight is implicit and unintentional, producing profound changes in cognition without immediate verbal knowledge.

# Jhāna as a State of Altered Consciousness

* Early Buddhist jhāna is described as a meditative practice that combines insight with sensitivity to both mind and senses.
* While it involves altered states of consciousness free from discursive thought, it differs from traditional classifications of *samatha* (concentration) and *vipassanā* (insight).

# Evidence for Jhāna in Later Traditions

* Similar forms of meditation can be found in later Buddhist traditions and teachings of modern Theravādin masters.
* Silent illumination practiced by Chan master Hongzhi exemplifies a state of simultaneous silence and illumination, where clarity arises without grasping at thoughts.
* *Vipassanā jhāna*, as described by Sayadaw U Pandita, involves focusing on impermanence, suffering, and absence of self, leading to insight and wisdom.

# Misinterpretation of Jhāna

* The paradoxical nature of early Buddhist jhāna, combining insight with calm and sensitivity, likely contributed to its later misinterpretation.
* The concept of implicit insight was difficult to grasp, leading to a focus on verbalized knowledge as the primary form of liberating insight.
* This shift resulted in a reinterpretation of jhāna as a concentrative practice, divorcing it from the spontaneous nature of insight described in early texts.

# Conclusion

* Early Buddhist jhāna represents a unique meditative state characterized by profound cognitive effects and spontaneous insight.
* While later interpretations have emphasized concentration or verbalized knowledge, the original understanding highlights the transformative power of implicit insight arising naturally from a purified mind.
