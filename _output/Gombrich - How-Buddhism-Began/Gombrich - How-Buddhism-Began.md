# How Buddhism Began

* This book offers a fresh look at the earliest Buddhist texts.
* It argues that understanding the Buddha requires understanding his debates with other religious teachers, especially Brahmins.
* The book emphasizes the importance of metaphor, allegory, and literalism in shaping Buddhist doctrines.
* It suggests that successive generations of disciples created distinctions and developed doctrines beyond the Buddha's original intention by taking his words literally despite his warnings.

# Introduction To The Second Edition
* This book aims to present the Buddha's ideas in their historical context.
* The author acknowledges other scholars' contributions to understanding the Buddha's teachings, particularly regarding brahminical influences and meditation origins.
* The book explores doctrinal changes within the Pali Canon by tracing how ideas evolve over time, potentially leading to misunderstandings or diverse interpretations.

# Doctrinal Development
* Hwang Soon-il's doctoral thesis investigates the development of the concept of nirvana in the Pali Canon.
* The author emphasizes that they are not concerned with establishing a precise chronology of texts but rather tracing the evolution of ideas within them.
* They reject conspiracy theories suggesting intentional alterations to the texts by monks.

# New Interpretations and Commentarial Tradition
* The author defends their new interpretations of Buddhist teachings against criticism, arguing that they offer explanations for why these interpretations were overlooked by ancient commentators.
* They suggest that commentators may have lacked knowledge of brahminism or attempted to smooth out inconsistencies in the text.
* In some cases, the author proposes textual emendations to improve coherence and understanding.

# Realism vs. Idealism
* Sue Hamilton's work builds on the book's discussion of the Buddha's realism/idealism debate.
* Hamilton argues that the Buddha focused on lived experience rather than metaphysical questions about existence.
* This interpretation, according to the author, sheds light on the diverse interpretations of Buddhist teachings.

# Monks Released by Insight and Supernormal Powers
* The author discusses monks who are said to be "released by insight" but lack supernormal powers associated with meditation.
* They cite a story from the *Divyavadana* that suggests a monk could acquire these powers through effort, implying prior practice of meditative techniques.

# Narrative Accidents and Sectarian Orthodoxy
* The author reflects on the possibility that some Buddhist narratives might be "narrative accidents" rather than strict doctrinal statements.
* They suggest that sectarian orthodoxy may not have been rigidly defined, allowing for flexibility in soteriological narratives.





# Preface

* The author was invited to give the Jordan Lectures for 1994 with a specific format requiring four scripts in advance.
* The lectures were discussed in seminars where attendees made observations and asked questions.
* Due to time constraints, the author could not fully incorporate seminar discussions into the revised lectures.
* The author acknowledges contributions from individuals who wrote after the seminars.
* The author explains inconsistencies in hyphenation, Pali word usage, and translation choices, prioritizing clarity over elegance.

# Abbreviations

* A list of abbreviations used for Pali texts and other references is provided.

# Debate, Skill In Means, Allegory And Literalism

* The lectures aim to formulate problems and raise questions rather than provide definitive answers.
* The author emphasizes the tentative nature of their conclusions and acknowledges their own limitations in knowledge.
* Karl Popper's epistemology is cited as a guiding principle, emphasizing provisional knowledge and the importance of criticism for progress.
* The author hopes to inspire constructive criticism and further research in early Buddhism.
* Popper's warning against essentialism is highlighted, advocating for understanding through exploring "why" and "how" rather than seeking definitions. 




# I

* Much debate in comparative religion is unproductive because it seeks "correct" definitions.
* Definitions can be useful for specific purposes but there's no single correct definition for terms like "religion."
* The author argues against essentialism, the belief that things have unchanging essences.

# II

* The author discusses his social history of Theravada Buddhism and how he addressed potential objections to studying religion historically.
* His current focus is on doctrinal history, specifically how the Buddha's teachings emerged through debate and were later interpreted by his followers.

# III

* The author introduces the concepts of essentialism and nominalism, arguing that the Buddha's teachings align with a nominalist perspective.
* He cites Karl Popper's work on science and essentialism, noting similarities between Popper's ideas and Buddhist philosophy.
* The author argues that the Buddha took a non-essentialist view of Buddhism itself, distinguishing between the eternal truths (dharma) and their institutionalization (sasana).

# IV

* Some scholars question whether Buddhism is a useful concept due to the diversity of its forms.
* The author suggests that the Buddhist doctrine of conditioned genesis can help understand the connections between different forms of Buddhism.
* He argues against extreme relativism while advocating for a middle way between oversimplification and excessive deconstruction.

# V

* The author applies the concepts of impermanence and conditioned genesis to the Pali Canon, setting the stage for an examination of these texts.

# The Critical Study of Buddhist Texts

* Modern editors of the Pali Canon have generally contented themselves with trying to establish a *textus receptus* or 'received text'.
* Most of our physical evidence for the Pali Canon is astonishingly recent, far more recent than our physical evidence for the western classical and biblical texts.
* The vast majority of Pali manuscripts are less than three hundred years old.

# The Limitations of Existing Evidence

*  The commentaries, even though they too are available to us in similarly recent manuscripts, provide many opportunities for cross-checking.
* Most of the canonical texts cannot be later than the first century B.C., and in fact I would argue that most of them must go back in substance to at least the third century B.C..

# Using Chinese Translations

* Most of the sermons (*suttas*) survive also in Chinese translation, sometimes in more than one version.
* A great deal can be gained by comparing the Pali with the Chinese versions.

# The Need for Critical Analysis

* We can apply our critical intelligence, and at least point out where the texts seem to be incoherent and may therefore be corrupt.
* Editors have hitherto been reluctant to suggest any emendation which has no manuscript support. I would like them to be bolder.

# My Position on the Pali Canon

* I do not 'take divergencies within these materials' (the Nikayas), 'and even incoherences . . . to be of little significance'; still less do I 'regard doctrinal developments during the oral period of transmission to have been minimal'.
* My main purpose is not to stratify the texts, even if that is a by-product of some of my arguments. I want to trace the evolution of some of the ideas contained in the Buddha's teachings as reported in the Pali texts, in order to get a clearer idea of what the texts are saying.

# The Role of Debate

* The Buddha, like anyone else, was communicating in a social context, reacting to his social environment and hoping in turn to influence those around him.
* The *dharma* is the product of argument and debate, the debate going on in the oral culture of renouncers and brahmins (*samaja-brahmaja*), as the recurrent phrase has it, in the upper Ganges plain in the fifth century B.C.. 




## Evidence for the Buddha's Environment

* There is limited evidence for writing in India during the Buddha's time.
* The brahmin texts the Buddha reacted to were likely orally preserved and may have changed over time.
* Information about other renouncer groups is scarce, with Jain texts being the most accessible but still incomplete.

## The Genesis of the Buddha's Teaching

* The *dharma* emerged from debate and discussion within a specific religious milieu.
* Understanding this context provides a balanced view between seeing Buddhism as simply Hinduism or entirely separate.

## The Buddha's Approach to Debate

* The Buddha engaged in dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds, adapting his language to their beliefs.
* He avoided direct confrontation and instead used "skill in means" to guide them towards enlightenment.
* This approach likely resulted in inconsistencies in his expressed views, which were later smoothed out by tradition.




## The Variety of Expression in Buddhist Texts

* Converts came from diverse backgrounds and likely continued using some of their former terms and concepts.
* This variety influenced the formulation of teachings, leading to multiple currents within texts.

## Debate Within and Around the Sangha

* Debates among monks on doctrinal points were common and often involved seeking the Buddha's arbitration.
* Many unresolved arguments remained after the Buddha's death, influencing later doctrinal developments.

## Allegory in Buddhist Texts

* The Buddha sometimes used allegory to present his teachings, as seen in the Mahavagga of the *Vinaya Pitaka*.
* Allegory can be a form of literalism, extending metaphor into narrative.

## Unintentional Literalism and Scholastic Literalism

* Unintentional literalism has driven doctrinal changes by focusing on precise words rather than speaker intention.
* Scholastic literalism involves reading distinctions into earlier texts that were never intended.

## The Buddha's Awareness of Literalism

* The Buddha recognized the dangers of literalism, as seen in his classification of listeners and condemnation of those who "put the words first."

## The Raft Simile and Misinterpretation

* The raft simile warns against clinging to the words of teachings rather than their spirit.
* Later exegetes misinterpreted the text phrase by phrase, leading to paradoxical interpretations.




# Clearly *dhamm*a and *adhamm*a in the sentence are a pair: *adhamm*a is the contrary of dhamma.

* *Dhamma* can mean 'prescribed behaviour or condition', and *adhamma* the opposite, a behaviour or condition condemned by the Buddha.
* Buddhaghosa has selected this meaning of *adhamma* here, but as a result he has to interpret *dhamma* as a recommended state.

# Continues... Debate, Skill In Means, Allegory And Literalism 25

* The Buddha was the great communicator and master of skill in means.
* He foresaw that even he would not be able to preserve his teaching from corruption.
* The author hopes they have been able to convey their intended meaning.

# How, Not What: Kamma As A Reaction To Brahminism

* The Buddha's teaching evolved in dialogue with other religious teachers, especially brahmins.
* He was not an essentialist and was interested in how things worked rather than what they were.
* The author is uncertain about how interested the Buddha himself was in presenting a philosophically coherent doctrine.

# Ii

* The text discusses the debate between the Madhyamikas, who believed the Buddha had no viewpoint, and the Svatantrikas, who argued for a positive Buddhist philosophy based on canonical passages.
* The Buddha emphasized experience over reason, as seen in the Kalama Sutta where he encourages questioning and personal verification of teachings.

# Buddhist Philosophy

* The Buddha criticized brahmins who claimed knowledge without experience, using the *Tevijja* Sutta to highlight the importance of firsthand knowledge.
* While there are "right views" in the Canon, the Buddha's emphasis on pragmatism suggests he may have held back from fully articulating his philosophy.
* The emergence of Buddhist philosophy is seen as an unintended consequence of the Buddha's preaching and social interactions.

# Upanisadic Teachings

* The text outlines key Upanisadic teachings: rebirth based on karma, escape through gnosis of Brahman (ultimate reality), the nature of reality as a unity of microcosm and macrocosm, and the unchanging essence of Atman (self).
* These teachings are contrasted with the Buddha's own views.

# Buddhist Response to Upanishads

* The Buddha accepted the Upanisadic dichotomy between changing phenomena and an unchanging ultimate reality but denied the existence of the latter as a thing.
* He also rejected the notion of an essence in both the individual and the universe, drawing a parallel equation of 0=0 instead of the Upanisadic 1=1.

# Development of Buddhist Ontology

* The text suggests that the development of Buddhist ontology can be traced through the changing use of the word "dhamma."
* In brahminical thought, Dharma refers to both what is and what should be, encompassing categories of things classified by their essences.




# The Meaning of *Dhamma*

* The Buddhist Dharma has two facets: descriptive and normative.
* While Pali Canon doesn't use the term "sva-dharma," *dhamm*a often appears in plural form, referring to what the Buddha taught.
*  The plural *dhamm*a can also mean "rules" or, most commonly, "objects of thought."

# The Development of *Dhamma* as a Concept

* In early Buddhism, *dhamm*a refers to the contents of thought, similar to how sights are objects of seeing.
* This sense of *dhamm*a is broad and difficult to translate accurately.
* Steven Collins suggests that *dhamm*a initially referred to both elements of the normative system and "objects" of insight meditation.

# Meditation and the Expansion of *Dhamma*

* In meditation texts, meditators train themselves to see reality as the Buddha taught it.
* They progress from observing physical processes to being aware of feelings, states of mind, and finally, *dhamm*a (plural).
* The *dhamm*a in this context are the Buddha's teachings, which become synonymous with any object of thought for Buddhists.

# Ontology and the Plurality of *Dhamma*

* The term *dhamm*a likely generalized from this meditative context.
* Early Buddhist texts classify phenomena according to senses but don't suggest a finite number of things.
* This contrasts with brahminical *sva-dharmas*, which imply a closed universe.


# The Influence of Vaifesika Philosophy

* In Sanskrit, *dharm*ah (plural) acquired the meaning "noeta" (objects of thought).
* This usage may have originated from Buddhism and influenced the *Vaifesika* school of philosophy, which shares similarities with Buddhist sense perception theory.

# Abhidhamma and the Rise of Essentialism

* Compiling lists of things the Buddha referred to led to the idea that these constituted the building blocks of the universe.
* This resulted in a closed inventory of *dhamm*a, though their instances could be numerous.
* While opposing Upanisadic monism, Buddhist *abhidhamma* resembled brahminical thought in its conception of a finite number of things.

# Nagarjuna's Reaction and the Buddha's Intention

* Nagarjuna reacted against essentialism, aligning with the Buddha's original intention.
* Buddhism contrasts with Brahminism on both moral and ontological levels.

# Buddhism vs. Jainism

* Buddhism is open-ended in contrast to Jainism's closed cosmological diagrams and exhaustive classifications.
* The Buddhist universe is unbounded spatially, while Jain cosmology is finite.

# The Buddha's Rejection of *Atman*

* The Buddha rarely uses ontological language but explicitly denies the existence of *atman* (self/essence).
* He rejects the Upanisadic dictum "tat tvam asi" ("Thou art that"), which identifies individual and world self/essence.

# Texts Denying Self-Existence

* The *Alagaddupama Sutta* refutes the idea that one's self is identical to the world or that one becomes the world self at death.
* The *Akguttara Nikaya* lists eighteen thoughts about internal and external selves, all rooted in craving for existence.
* These texts highlight the Buddha's attack on constructing an ontology based on the idea of "I exist."

# The Upanisadic Roots of Self-Concept

* The Upanisads developed the doctrine of self-identity through speculation on sacrifice.
* The *Taittiriya SaÅhit*a links the concept of *atman* to the physical body, specifically faeces as the core of the self.

# The Buddha's Teaching on Consciousness

* The Buddha uses the example of cow dung to illustrate the impermanence of all things, including the self.
* He alludes to Vedic doctrine, suggesting that the assumption of a physical existence in the next world is also impermanent.
* This idea is supported by the Buddha's use of the word "attabhava" which usually refers to the body or person in a particular life, rather than the self.

# The Buddha and Vedanta

* Some scholars argue that the Buddha's soteriology was close to Vedanta because of shared terminology like "brahma-bhuto."
* However, the author argues that the Buddha used the language of his opponents metaphorically.
* A passage in the *Udana* (VIII, 3) seems to support a Vedantic view, but its context is unknown and it could be interpreted as logic rather than ontology.

# Consciousness and Ontology

* The Buddha never confused epistemology with ontology, unlike the Upanisads.
* He did not reify consciousness, seeing it as a process, not a thing.
* A verse in the *Kevaddha Sutta* seems to reify consciousness, but the author argues that it can be interpreted as describing the cessation of consciousness in nirvana.

# Conditioned Origination

* The doctrine of conditioned origination (paticca-samuppada) is central to the Buddha's teaching, explaining how processes occur in a non-random manner.
* There are different interpretations of this doctrine, but they all emphasize the interdependence of phenomena.
* Even the Buddha found it difficult to understand and teach, highlighting its complexity.

## The Buddha's Doctrine of Dependent Origination and Karma

* **Sati's Misunderstanding:**

    * A monk named Sati believed in an unchanging consciousness that transmigrates after death. This view was considered a "wicked view" by the Buddha.
    * Sati's belief is compared to Arittha's view, which denied the importance of monastic discipline for spiritual progress.
    * Both views are seen as stemming from a lack of understanding of the Buddha's teachings.

* **Dependent Origination:**

    * The Buddha explained that consciousness arises dependently on various causes.
    * He used the analogy of fire arising from different fuels to illustrate this point: just as fire is classified according to its fuel, consciousness is classified according to its cause (e.g., eye-consciousness arises from visual stimuli).
    * This concept emphasizes the interconnectedness of all phenomena and the absence of a permanent, independent self.

* **Karma as Central to Buddhism:**

    * The author argues that karma is central to Buddhist ideology, contrary to some anthropological views that see it as secondary or linked to an "insufficiency ethic."
    * Karma refers primarily to morally relevant action, with intention being the key factor.

* **The Buddha's Redefinition of Karma:**

    * The Buddha redefined "action" as "intention," shifting the focus from physical acts to mental processes.
    * This challenged brahminical ritualism and emphasized ethical responsibility for one's thoughts and motivations.

* **Purification and Progress:**

    * In Buddhism, purification became a dominant metaphor for spiritual progress.
    * Good karma is seen as purifying, leading to happiness and liberation from suffering.

* **Skilful and Unskilful Karma:**

    * "Typical" karma refers to overt actions with external effects, while "dogmatic" karma encompasses any morally charged action (physical, vocal, or mental).
    * Skilful karma arises from non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion, leading to happiness and liberation.

* **Beyond Karma:**

    * At higher stages of spiritual development, typical karma becomes less relevant as one transcends the need for its benefits.
    * The Enlightened person has not eliminated karma but has rendered it irrelevant through the eradication of unskilful intentions.

# The Dual Conception of Karma

* Ordinary words are not always adequate for extraordinary circumstances.
* Philosophical analysis does not always find everyday language an adequate tool.
* An example is the term "karma," which has a dual conception: typical karma and dogmatic karma.

# Typical and Dogmatic Karma

* Typical karma refers to the karmic consequences of actions motivated by desire, as seen in lay life.
* Dogmatic karma refers to the actions of enlightened beings, who act without desire and thus have no karmic consequences.
* This distinction is analogous to the philosophical concept of "pro-attitude," which generalizes the notion of desire.

# The Sarvastivada School

* The Sarvastivada school was a pre-Mahayana Buddhist tradition that divided into two branches: Vaibhasikas and Sautrantikas.
* The Vaibhasikas interpreted the Buddha's definition of karma to include both intention and its manifestation in bodily or verbal action.
* They separated intention from the act, considering intention as "dogmatic" karma and the manifestation as "typical" karma.

# The Mechanism of Karma

* Buddhist philosophers sought to understand how good or bad karma leads to results for the doer.
* The Sarvastivadins believed that past acts still existed in the present, leading to their consequences.
* They classified everything as either mental or physical, except space and nirvana.

# Non-Information Karma

* The Vaibhasikas introduced the concept of "non-information" karma, a physical entity imperceptible to the senses but carrying the karmic effect of an action.
* This resembled Jain beliefs about karma being generated in physical form.
* The Sautrantikas, however, rejected this interpretation and adhered to the Buddha's emphasis on intention as the core of karma.

# Transfer of Merit

* The transfer of merit is a significant concept in Buddhism, with roots in brahminical texts.
* The Sarvastivada used the term "prapti" (possession) to explain how properties like karma could be transferred between processes.
* The Theravada adopted this term but focused on transferring "possession" of merit rather than merit itself.

# Merit and Salvation

* In Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas and bodhisattvas saved others by transferring merit.
* This transfer of reified karma can be seen as analogous to divine grace in Christianity.
* It subverts the original ethic of intention-based karma and allows for salvation without individual effort.




# Joining Brahma

* The text discusses how the Buddha presents a path to joining Brahma after death, which is understood metaphorically as attaining nirvana.
* This path involves cultivating boundless kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, pervading one's mind with these qualities.
* The Buddha contrasts this approach with the brahminical idea of achieving liberation through gnosis and identifying with universal consciousness.

# Ethicized Consciousness

* The Buddha emphasizes an "ethicized" consciousness, where kindness and ethical behavior are central to spiritual progress.
* This stands in contrast to the Upanisadic notion of a static, unchanging Self.
* The text highlights the importance of action and moral conduct over metaphysical speculation.

# Tevijja Sutta and SN Sutta III, 1, 8

* Both texts demonstrate the Buddha's response to Upanisadic teachings by focusing on ethical behavior rather than metaphysical concepts.
* The *Tevijja Sutta* presents kindness as a path to salvation, while SN *sutta* III, 1, 8 uses a conversation between King Pasenadi and Queen Mallika to illustrate the importance of caring for others.

# Self and Moral Agency

* The Buddha's teachings prioritize moral agency over metaphysical conceptions of self.
* While he doesn't explicitly deny the existence of a self, his emphasis is on ethical conduct and its consequences.
* The text suggests that "being kind" is a central aspect of Buddhist practice, though it may not be universally interpreted as salvific in all Buddhist traditions.



# Iii Metaphor, Allegory, Satire

* The Buddha frequently used simile and metaphor in his teachings.
* The Pali Canon uses the term *pariyaya* for figurative language, contrasting it with the systematized presentation of doctrine in the Abhidhamma (*nippariyayena*).
* This chapter explores how literally various features of early Buddhist texts should be interpreted.

# Nirvana as Metaphor

* Nirvana is part of an extended metaphor that includes Enlightenment and its opposite.
* The three fires (passion, hatred, delusion) symbolize what needs to be extinguished in order to achieve nirvana.
* The Buddha likely drew this metaphor from the Vedic practice of brahmins tending three sacred fires.

# The Five Khandha as Fuel

* The term *upadana* refers to both attachment and the fuel that sustains it.
* The five khandha (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are metaphorically described as bundles of fuel (*upa*dana-kkhandha*) that feed the fires of craving.

# The Burden Metaphor

* In SN III, 25–6, the Buddha uses the metaphor of a burden to describe the five khandha and craving.
* This metaphor was misinterpreted by the *pudgalavadin* school, who took it literally to argue for the existence of a separate self (*pudgala*).

# Sa-upadi-sesa and An-upadi-sesa Nirvana

* The terms *sa-upadi-sesa* and *an-upadi-sesa* refer to two types of nirvana.
* *Sa-upadi-sesa* nirvana is achieved while alive, with the five khandha still present but no longer burning.
* *An-upadi-sesa* nirvana occurs at death, when the five khandha cease to exist.

# The Burning House Allegory

* The Lotus Sutra's allegory of the burning house echoes the Fire Sermon's metaphor.
* This allegory uses the image of a burning mansion to represent the world and suffering beings trapped inside.

# The Buddha's Miracles in the Vinaya Khandhaka

* In the Vinaya Khandhaka, the Buddha performs miracles to convert brahmin fire-worshippers.
* These miracles, particularly those involving fire, can be seen as an extension of the Fire Sermon metaphor.

# The Fire Sermon

* This text begins by claiming the Buddha is a true brahmin.
* It depicts the Buddha's superiority to Brahma, the god representing brahmins' essence.
* The text presents brahmin religious practice as the epitome of what is wrong with life.
* The Buddha rejects it not because he is unqualified but because it contradicts true desirability.

# The Contest with Naga Worship

* The Buddha impersonates Agni, the brahmins' fire god, in a contest.
* This suggests a takeover bid rather than a debate.
* Another contest exists between Buddhism and naga worship.
* Epigraphic and archaeological evidence supports naga worship in shrines and temples.

# Naga Ordination

* A story explains the rule forbidding animal ordination.
* It involves a naga disguising itself as a human to be ordained.
* The Buddha reveals the naga's true nature, stating nagas cannot progress in his doctrine.
* In Sri Lanka, higher ordination candidates are dressed like nagas, possibly symbolizing wealth and status.

# Naga Symbolism

* "Naga" has three meanings: supernatural cobra, elephant, and ironwood tree.
* The saying that naga is the greatest among trees, serpents, and laity suggests its association with wealth.
* Important monks are referred to as mahanaga, indicating naga did not denote lay status in Pali texts.

# Appropriation of Terms

* The Buddha is called "naga" because he commits no offenses.
* This suggests Buddhism appropriated terms from other groups, including naga worshippers.
* The Sinhalese ordination custom may be a response to naga worship, claiming Buddhist nagas are superior.

# Allegorical Biography

* Much of the narrative about the Buddha's life after Enlightenment is allegorical.
* His biography before Enlightenment also contains allegorical elements.


# The Origin of the Buddha's Story

* The story of the four encounters (old age, sickness, death, ascetic) is told of Vipassi, not Siddhattha Gotama.
* This suggests a common pattern for all Buddhas' early lives.
* The *Mahapadana Sutta*, containing this story, may not be from the Buddha's time but composed later.

# Poems in the Suttanipata

* The first poem, Pabbajja Sutta, describes the Buddha leaving home and meeting King Bimbisara.
* The second poem, Padhana Sutta, begins with "While I was exerting myself," suggesting a first-person narration.
* Both poems were likely originally one, but the commentary ascribes them to different authors.

# The Padhana Sutta and Mara

* This text tells the story of Buddha's Enlightenment through an allegorical battle with Mara, personifying death. 
* It differs from the accepted version where Buddha reaches enlightenment by overcoming asceticism.
* In this poem, Mara tempts Buddha to abandon asceticism, but Buddha defiantly states that his weakening flesh strengthens his mind and understanding.

# The Nature of Mara

* Mara represents both Death and Desire, urging Buddha towards a life in the world which Buddhists see as repeated death.
* He is depicted with an army representing various desires and moral temptations.
* This allegory portrays normal life as a form of death.

# Asceticism and Enlightenment

* The depiction of Buddha defeating Mara through asceticism contradicts orthodox Buddhist teachings.
* It suggests Jain influence, where asceticism is seen as the path to liberation.
* This text might reflect a debate within Buddhism about the role of asceticism in achieving enlightenment.

# Humor and Satire in Depictions of Mara

* The Pali texts often treat Mara lightly, even humorously.
* In the *Ma*ra-tajjaniya Sutta*, Moggallana expels Mara from his body, asserting authority over him.
* At the end of the Padhana Sutta, Mara is compared to a crow disappointed by a stone resembling fat, highlighting his foolishness.

# Satirizing Brahminical Cosmogony

* The Buddha used allegory satirically, as seen in passages mocking brahminical accounts of creation.
* One example is the Buddhist retelling of Brahma's creation myth, where Brahma's loneliness and desire for companionship lead him to believe he created other beings.
* This parody highlights the illusory nature of desires and challenges brahminical claims of divine creation.

# The Aggañña Sutta and Buddhist Cosmology

* The *Aggañña Sutta* parodies brahminical cosmogony, presenting a humorous account of the origin of society, kingship, and social classes.
* Although not intended as a literal explanation, Buddhists adopted it as a basis for understanding societal origins.
* This text reveals inconsistencies when taken literally, but its satirical nature renders these irrelevant.

# The Buddhist Map of the Cosmos

* Theravadin cosmology consists of two models: one depicting the five (or six) realms of rebirth according to karma, and another encompassing this within a larger framework.
* Human beings are situated in the middle of the smaller model, with heavens above and hells below.
* This system emphasizes the states of rebirth determined by karma.

# The Problem of Karma and Rebirth

* There are two types of karma: typical karma and dogmatic karma.
* Buddhists needed to explain what happens to people who die while in a state of high meditation.
* This led to the development of a complex cosmology with multiple levels of existence.

# The Buddhist Cosmology

* The Buddhist cosmos is divided into three parts: the plane of desire, the plane of form, and the plane of no form.
* The plane of desire corresponds to our world.
* The plane of form corresponds to the Brahma worlds.
* The plane of no form is inhabited by beings who have attained a high level of meditation.

# The Origin of the Cosmology

* The Buddhist cosmology was influenced by brahminical ideas about sacrifice and the universe.
* Buddhists adapted these ideas to fit their own beliefs about spiritual progress.
* Some details of the cosmology may have been added later through literal interpretations of Buddhist teachings.

# The Brahma-vihara

* The *brahma-vihara* are four states of mind that were originally thought to be salvific.
* Later, they came to be associated with rebirth in the Brahma world.
* Buddhaghosa reified these teachings into a hierarchical cosmology.

# Subjective States and Objective Correlates

* Buddhists believed that subjective states of mind had objective correlates.
* This belief was influenced by brahminical ideas about the microcosm and macrocosm.
* The Buddha's own views on this issue are unclear.

# Time in Buddhism

* Buddhists have two concepts of time: cosmic time and personal time.
* Cosmic time is cyclical and infinite, while personal time is created by our own mental activity.
* This dual structure reflects the brahminical influence on early Buddhism.




# The Literal and the Metaphorical

* The distinction between literal and metaphorical language is crucial in science but may be blurred in Buddhist texts describing meditative states.

* Determining whether descriptions of psychological states are literally applicable to the macrocosm or only metaphorically can be challenging.

# The Kevaddha Sutta

* This sutta uses satire and allegory to demonstrate the Buddha's superiority over Brahma.
* It involves a monk seeking answers about the elements from gods in different realms, ultimately leading him back to the Buddha.
* The story relies on the assumption that the gods exist outside the monk's mind and that he can travel to higher realms through meditation.

# Iddhi: Supernormal Powers

* The Buddha finds supernormal powers like levitation loathsome because they are achievable through magic and wouldn't lead to conversion.
* While the Buddha generally disapproves of such powers, there are instances where he displays them, suggesting a complex attitude towards their use.
* The exercise of *iddhi* in some texts appears allegorical, expressing the Buddha's understanding of life processes.

# Blurring Boundaries: Earthquakes and Miracles

* Early Buddhist texts blur boundaries between natural phenomena and supernatural events.
* The Maha Parinibbana Sutta suggests that earthquakes can be caused by powerful individuals with control over their minds.
* This concept challenges traditional cosmologies and implies a connection between thought and physical reality.

# Perception and Reality

* The text explores the relationship between perception (*sañña*) and reality, questioning whether our perceptions accurately reflect an independent world.
* The Buddha's teachings focus on processes rather than ontological status, leaving open the possibility of both idealist and realist interpretations.
* The term *loka-mani* ("thinking oneself to be the world") suggests a potential moral message about egotism and the identification of self with experience.

# Open Interpretations

* The Buddha's teachings intentionally avoid taking sides in ontological debates, leaving room for multiple interpretations.
* His focus on processes and experiences rather than fixed entities makes questions like "Does a Buddha exist after death?" ultimately unanswerable within his framework.

# Retracing An Ancient Debate: How Insight Worsted Concentration In The Pali Canon

* This chapter focuses on changes within the Pali Canon regarding how Enlightenment can be achieved.
* It highlights the idea that Enlightenment can be attained through intellectual analysis (insight) alone, as seen in two Sutta Pitaka texts.
* This concept is also found in a Buddhist Sanskrit text by Harivarman, but Theravada Buddhism is the only surviving school to accept it.

# Iv

* The chapter proposes two processes of change: scholastic literalism and debate.
* Scholastic literalism involves reading more meaning into words than intended, while debate arose from discrepancies in accounts within the Sutta Pitaka.
* These processes are not mutually exclusive and often intertwined.

* A seven-fold classification of people based on moral and spiritual types is found in the *Puggala-paññatti*.
* This classification lists: released on both sides, released by insight, bodily witness, who has seen the point, released by faith, follower of the teaching, and follower through faith.

* The Kitagiri Sutta explains each type in terms of meditative states (vimokkha) and corruptions (asava).
* It describes how each type interacts with these concepts and whether they need to be careful about their actions.
* The *Puggala-paññatti* provides supplementary information, highlighting the progression from follower of the teaching to who has seen the point and from follower through faith to released by faith.

* The classification system reveals inconsistencies, particularly regarding the "released by faith" type who is not actually released.

## The Seven Types of Spiritual Attainment

* This section discusses a list of seven types of spiritual attainment found in Buddhist texts.
* Two individuals on this list are described as "released," meaning they have achieved liberation from suffering.
* The criteria for release seem to be based on the destruction of corruptions through insight, but this concept is not fully explained.

## AN IV, 74–9: A Dialogue on Spiritual Attainment

* This section analyzes a text from the Anguttara Nikaya (AN IV, 74–9) that also discusses the seven types of attainment.
* The text features a dialogue between monks Tissa and Moggallana about the knowledge gods have of human spiritual progress.
* Tissa describes the first six types on the list, stating that their attainment may lead to Enlightenment under favorable conditions.
* Moggallana then consults the Buddha, who adds the seventh type: "the one who stays in the signless."

## Interpretation and Debate

* The author interprets AN IV, 74–9 as part of a debate among early Buddhists about the relative value of faith, concentration, and insight for achieving Enlightenment.
* Insight is presented as the most powerful quality, leading to release, while faith is seen as weaker.
* The text seems to argue that concentration should be valued more highly than faith in the path to Enlightenment.

## Comparing Texts: AN I, 118–120

* This section compares AN IV, 74–9 with another text (AN I, 118–120) where three monks debate the merits of different types of attainment.
* The Buddha ultimately concludes that any of these types can potentially achieve Enlightenment, highlighting the various paths to liberation.

## The Nature of Buddhist Texts

* This section emphasizes that Buddhist texts are not literal records but formalized and standardized versions of oral teachings.
* Despite their formalization, these texts reflect real debates and discussions among early Buddhists about spiritual practice.

## Comparing Lists: Seven Types vs. Six Grades

* This section compares the list of seven types with a six-grade system found in the Alagaddupama Sutta (MN 22).
* The author argues that the "follower of the teaching" and "follower through faith" were originally considered a single category, later separated by scholastic interpretations.

## The Evolution of Categories

* This section traces the development of the distinction between "dhammânusari" (follower of the teaching) and "saddhânusari" (follower through faith).
* The author suggests that this separation occurred when these terms were isolated from their original context and ranked within a hierarchical system.

# The only text I know of which gives a little more substance to this differential - until we reach our list of seven

* At III, 225 all of the six organs of the senses are said to be impermanent and liable to change; at III, 227 the same is said of the five aggregates (*khandha*).
* Both texts continue: O monks, one who has faith in and feels sure about these teachings (*dhamm*a) is called a follower through faith; he has entered on the way to correctness; he has entered the stage of good men (*sappurisa-bhumi*) and passed beyond the stage of ordinary unenlightened people (*puthujjana-bhumi*).
* He cannot do anything which would cause him to be reborn in hell or as an animal or ghost.

# When we look back at the definitions of these two types in the Kita*giri Sutta*

* The *saddhânusari* is positively defined mainly by the fact that he 'only has faith in and affection for the Tathagata'.
* The phrase is apparently borrowed from the sixth and final category in the Alagaddu*pama Sutta*.
* The need felt to differentiate the *dhammânusari* from the saddhânusari has led to a slight distortion of that passage, a distortion which adds plausibility to our tracing of the line of development.

# I believe that this discussion covers all informative occurrences of the terms dhammânusari and *saddhânusar*i

* For their mention in the list of seven or its extensions, the references have been given above.
* Now that we have seen how debate and scholastic literalism combined to form the lower half of our original list, we turn our attention to the top three types in the list.

# The competition between meditation and insight as the effective method by which to achieve nirvana

* This is the topic of a justly famous article by Louis de La Vallée Poussin: 'Musila et Narada: Le Chemin de Nirvaja' (de La Vallée Poussin, 1936–7).
* Though I do not entirely agree with what he says - to begin with, I do not think that either 'ascetic' or 'ecstatic' is an appropriate description of Buddhist meditation - I have thought it useful here to give a translation of the beginning of his article (minus its first paragraph), and do so in the Appendix.

# I see the devaluation of concentration as originating in certain identifiable texts

* One of them is called the *Susima Sutta* (SN II, 119–128).
* This is the text, de La Vallée Poussin tells us (p. 201), on which Harivarman based his position that one could attain release without entering any of the *jhana*, the stages of concentration.

# Before I do that, however, I must trace the route by which pañña-vimutto, 'released by insight', came to be seen as half of the obscure concept 'released on both sides'

* Our investigation of this begins with the corresponding abstract noun, *paññavimutti*.
* How should we translate *paññ*a? The P.E.D. entry begins: 'intelligence, comprising all the higher faculties of cognition, "intellect as conversant with general truths" (Dial. II, 68), reason, wisdom, insight, knowledge, recognition.'

# When the word *pañña-vimutti* appears in the texts it is usually paired with *ceto-vimutti*

* The P.E.D. says of *ceto* that it equals citta, and on the latter it has an enormous article.
* As it says, 'in Indian Psychology *citta* is the seat and organ of thought'; it also simply means 'thought' or 'thinking'.


# Just as was the case with *dhammânusarino* and saddhânusarino

* I do not think that these words originated as technical terms.
* I suppose there is probably no psychological term in the early Buddhist texts which did not finally come to be classified by the *abhidhamma* and so acquire a technical meaning; and certainly *citta/ceto* and *paññ*a have precise meanings in systematised dogmatics.

# Because the compounds *ceto-vimutti* and *pañña-vimutti* differ in syntax, they do not have quite the same meaning

* But they originally have the same reference.
* There is only one release: it is a mental event, triggered by insight.

# However, for the Buddhist tradition my assumptions that these are not technical terms but that they are near-synonyms with the same reference are problematic

* At MN I, 437, Ananda asks the Buddha why some monks are *ceto-vimuttino* and some *paññavimuttino*.
* The Buddha does not reply, as in effect he did to the three monks at AN I, 118–120, that there is no answer to this question.

# There are several *suttas* with which we could illustrate this contrast

* Let us look as AN I, 61: O monks, there are these two things conducive to gnosis. Which? Calm and intuition.
* What advantage does one enjoy by developing calm? The mind is developed. What advantage does one enjoy by developing one's mind? Passion is abandoned. What advantage does one enjoy by developing intuition? Insight is developed.

# Four views can be found in the texts

* First: the above three-fold formulation naturally lends itself to a ranked interpretation: that each stage is a prerequisite for the next; that meditation is a training essential for understanding.
* This has probably been the most widespread interpretation. It shades into a second possible interpretation: that to attain nirvana both methods must to some extent be employed, but that either may be given priority.



# The Dichotomy Between Ceto-vimutti and Pañña-vimutti

* This view suggests that understanding is superior to meditation, potentially leading to Enlightenment alone.
* Some interpretations argue that only one type of *vimutti* (release) is genuine, creating a paradox in terminology.

# Early Formulations vs. Later Dichotomies

* Early formulations like the four jhana combine elements found later in separate methods.
* The dichotomy between ceto-vimutti (release of mind) and pañña*-vimutti (release by insight) becomes more prevalent in later interpretations.

# Redundancy and Synonymy in Buddhist Texts

* *Suttas* often use synonymous or near-synonymous words for emphasis and transmission clarity.
* Exegetes sometimes overanalyze this redundancy, seeking doctrinal rationale where there might be none.

# Analyzing the Formulae for Nirvana Attainment

* The formula "through the waning away of the corruptions...himself in this very life realizes, witnesses, attains and stays in the corruption-free release of mind, release by insight" exhibits significant redundancy.
* *Ceto-vimutti* and *pañña-vimutti* are used interchangeably, suggesting they refer to the same thing.

# Corroboration from Samañña-phala Sutta

* This sutta describes Enlightenment as true insight into the four noble truths leading to release from corruptions.
* The text uses "cittaÅ vimuccati" and "ceto-vimutti," demonstrating their interchangeability.
* Knowing one is enlightened is part of being enlightened, highlighting the clarity associated with this state.

# Challenging the Later Interpretation

* The *Mahavagga* of the *Vinaya Khandhaka* refers to the Buddha's Enlightenment as *ceto-vimutti*, not pañña*-vimutti, contradicting later hierarchical views.
* Similarly, in the *Anattalakkaja Sutta*, monks achieve enlightenment through understanding the three hallmarks of existence, yet it is described as *ceto-vimutti*.

# Further Evidence from Akguttara Nikaya

* A sutta in the Akguttara Nikaya explicitly states that developing certain perceptions leads to both *ceto-vimutti* and pañña*-vimutti, reinforcing their equivalence.

# Pañña-vimutti as a Term for Enlightenment

* In some passages, pañña*-vimutti is not contrasted with other types of Enlightenment, suggesting it simply refers to the state itself.
* The *Magandiya Sutta* describes both "dispassionate towards perceptions" and "released by insight" as reaching the same goal.

# The Origin of the Dichotomy

* The *Mahanidana Sutta*, while containing the formula for nirvana with both *ceto-vimutti* and pañña*-vimutti, also includes classifications of meditative states that deviate from standard ones.
* This suggests that early attempts to describe diverse meditative experiences might have contributed to the later dichotomy.

## The Maha-nida*na Sutta*

* This sutta outlines nine states of consciousness, including formless meditative levels and planes of existence beyond perception. 
* It emphasizes understanding the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of these states, leading to release through wisdom (*Pañña-vimutto*).

## The Kita*giri Sutta*

* This sutta introduces the term *ubhato-bhaga-vimutto*, 'released on both sides,' referring to a meditator who can freely enter and leave any of the eight meditative states.
* It highlights that true release involves understanding and experiencing these states, not merely achieving them intellectually.

## The Susima Sutta*

* This sutta presents a contrasting view where monks claim Enlightenment without meditative accomplishments.
* They assert release by insight alone (*Pañña-vimutto*), lacking the supernormal powers typically associated with advanced meditation.
* The redaction of this sutta, compared to its Chinese counterpart, seems to aim at elevating the status of the Buddha's monks by attributing Enlightenment to them without requiring extensive meditative practice.

## Analysis and Interpretation

* The texts analyzed present conflicting views on the nature of release (*vimutti*). 
* While the Maha-nida*na Sutta* and Kita*giri Sutta* emphasize the importance of meditation in attaining liberation, the Susima Sutta* suggests a possibility of Enlightenment through insight alone.
* This discrepancy highlights the complexities and potential ambiguities within Buddhist teachings regarding the path to liberation.

# The Buddha's View on Meditation and Enlightenment

* This section argues that the Buddha likely never envisioned enlightenment without meditation.
* It suggests that the term *pañña-vimutti*, originally referring to liberation through wisdom, came to encompass enlightenment without specific meditative attainment.
* This shift might be linked to changes in the *Susima Sutta*.

# The Emergence of "Enlightenment Without Meditation"

* This section explores how *pañña-vimutti* evolved to include enlightenment without meditation. 
* It highlights the *Susima Sutta* and its potential redefinition due to Sangha apologetics.
* The *Musila-Narada Sutta* is presented as a counterpoint, emphasizing the importance of experiential realization alongside intellectual understanding.

# Different Paths to Enlightenment

* This section examines various texts that depict different paths to enlightenment.
* It discusses the *Kita*giri Sutta*, which outlines seven types of enlightened beings, some achieving enlightenment through meditation and others through wisdom alone.
* The *Susima Sutta* is contrasted with the *Musila-Narada Sutta*, showcasing differing perspectives on the role of meditation in enlightenment.

# The Impact on Monastic Practices

* This section explores how the evolving understanding of enlightenment influenced monastic practices.
* It cites the *Chakka Nipata* sutta, which describes two groups of monks: those focused on meditation (*jhay*i) and those emphasizing intellectual pursuits (*dhamma-yoga*).
* The text highlights a division within the monastic community based on these differing approaches to enlightenment.

# Chronology of Changes

* This section attempts to establish a timeline for the development of these ideas.
* It notes similarities between the *Kita*giri Sutta* and the *Bhaddali Sutta*, suggesting they belong to a later stratum of texts.
* The author estimates that at least two to three generations, or around 65 years, would be required for such a significant shift in soteriology.

# Nirvana and Enlightenment

* This section clarifies the interchangeability of "nirvana" and "enlightenment" in early Buddhist texts.
* It defines nirvana as the extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, while enlightenment emphasizes the gnostic aspect of this achievement.

# Who Was Akgulimala?

* Akgulimala was a brigand who wore a necklace of his victims' fingers.
* He needed a thousand victims and was one short when he encountered the Buddha.
* The Buddha evaded Akgulimala's attack, leading to a dialogue that resulted in Akgulimala's conversion.
* The Buddha used wordplay on the verb "titthati" (to stay or stop) to convert Akgulimala.
* Two Pali Canon texts, the Thera-gatha and the Ak*gulimala Sutta*, recount this episode. 




# V

* Akgulimala was a mass murderer who wore a necklace of fingers.
* The Buddhist text, *Anguttara Nikaya* (AS), describes his encounter with the Buddha. 
* The commentaries, *Papañcasudani* (Ps) and *Paramattha-dipani* (Pad), provide background stories to explain Akgulimala's actions.

# Akgulimala's Origins

* Both Ps and Pad agree that Akgulimala was born a brahmin.
* Ps: He was born under the constellation of thieves, leading people to believe he would be a brigand.
* Pad: His birth worried the king because weapons shone brightly at his birth.

# Akgulimala's Education

* Both commentaries state that Akgulimala was sent to Taxila for education and excelled in his studies.
* Ps: Jealous classmates tricked his teacher into believing Akgulimala was having an affair with his wife.
* Pad: The jealous classmates convinced the teacher that Akgulimala was treacherous.
* Both versions say the teacher asked Akgulimala to kill a thousand people (Ps: legs, Pad: fingers) as a final test.

# Akgulimala's Transformation into a Brigand

* Ps: Akgulimala killed people in the jungle and collected their fingers to fulfill his teacher's demand.
* Pad: Akgulimala lived on a hilltop and took fingers from travelers, stringing them into a necklace.

# The King's Response

* Both commentaries mention that Akgulimala terrorized the region, forcing people to abandon their homes.
* The king of Kosala learned about Akgulimala's actions and planned to capture him.

# The Buddha's Intervention

* Ps: Akgulimala's mother recognized him as her son and went to bring him home.
* Pad: Akgulimala's mother also recognized him but was unable to convince his father to intervene. 
* Both versions state that the Buddha saw Akgulimala with his divine eye and knew he could be saved.

# The Encounter

* Ps: Akgulimala, needing only one more finger to complete his task, encountered the Buddha.
* Pad: Akgulimala, seeing his mother, planned to kill her for the final finger but changed his mind when he saw the Buddha.
* Both versions describe a confrontation between Akgulimala and the Buddha, where Akgulimala attempts to kill him.

# The Significance of the Necklace

* Ps: The necklace is explained as a mere counting device for the thousand people Akgulimala was ordered to kill.
* Pad: Dhammapala tries to make the teacher's request more direct by asking for fingers specifically.





# Even he, however, was not very successful at achieving coherence

* The text lacks coherence in describing the brigand wearing a necklace of fingers.
* It fails to address the impracticality and bulkiness of such a necklace.

# In the *suttas* of the four *nikayas*, i.e., the canonical collections of sermons, the Buddha occasionally interacts with super-normal beings.

* The Buddha primarily interacts with and preaches to human beings in these texts.
* These human portrayals seem realistic by modern standards.

# There also occur, in parts of the Pali Canon generally regarded as old, accounts of Buddhist monks performing miracles (patiha*riya*) which fall outside the standard list of *iddhi*.

* The monk Dabba's luminous finger is an example of such a miracle.
* Akgulimala saving a woman in childbirth might also be categorized as such a miracle.

# The Buddha's interlocutors mainly fall into two categories: laymen (often brahmins) and ascetics.

* Some ascetics have striking practices, like living like animals or restricting their diet.
* The Buddha addresses some *suttas* to individuals who live like dogs or cows.


# What I am trying to show is that, unless the AS is unique, Akgulimala must have been a type of person recognizable in the environment of his day.

* The text suggests that fearsome brigands existed, but it's unclear if they wore garlands of fingers.
* Commentators offer no plausible explanations for this detail.

# At this point let us return to the text.

* This section focuses on analyzing a specific verse from the text.

# Yet the first pada has twelve syllables, the second twelve (without being the permitted variant, a *jagat*i), the third only ten.


* The verse's meter is corrupt, with inconsistent syllable counts per line.
* Different manuscripts offer varying readings for the second pada.

# In the *Thag*, the third pada also scans: so 'ham cajissami sahassapapaÅ

* This section discusses the scanning of the third pada in a different edition.

# What does this verse mean? Translators have had to choose between what seems to fit the original Pali and what would make sense in the context of the story.

* Translating the verse accurately while maintaining its meaning within the story's context poses a challenge.
* Different translators offer varying interpretations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

## I Translate This Into English:

* Schmidt sees difficulty in the first line and suggests a present tense interpretation, adding "and I said to him" in brackets. 
* His translation of pahassaÅ as conditional is ingenious but grammatically possible, though it doesn't fit the Thag reading.
* Schmidt's interpretation depends on taking cirassaÅ/cirassa twice as "long ago," which is incorrect.

##  Miss Horner's Translation:

* She agrees with me about the adverb cirassaÅ naturally going with mahito. 
* Her translation of the second pada supplies "yet" and translates the main verb as present, but these points don't invalidate her interpretation.
* She translates cirassa in the third pada as "soon," suggesting a negative not in the text.

## The Commentaries:

* Both Ps (III, 33) and Pad (III, 57–8) agree that Akgulimala heard of the Buddha's reputation and was delighted to realize it was him.
* They interpret cirassaÅ vata as "after a long time indeed" and me as "in order to favour me."

## Problems with the First Line:

* The commentators detach me from mahito semantically, interpreting it as "for my sake," but this is linguistically awkward.
* The Burmese variant reading *so 'haÅ carissami pahaya p*apa*Å ('So I shall live abandoning evil') scans and makes sense.

##  The Third Pada:

* The AS (and Thag) make no mention of Akgulimala needing a thousand fingers when he encounters the Buddha.
* The idea that he needed a thousand must have arisen from an over-literal interpretation of the line "so 'haÅ cajissami sahassa-papaÅ" ('So I shall abandon a thousand evils').

##  The First Two Padas:

* The version of the second line in the text of the AS has one syllable too many.
* Norman tries to make the first line scan by deleting the anusvara at the end of cirassaÅ and claiming resolution of the fourth syllable, but this is rare in Pali tutthubha.

## A Proposed Solution:

* The first line must be corrupt. Changing *mahesi* to *maheso* resolves many problems.
* Akgulimala is revealed as a proto-Faiva/Fakta, worshipping Fiva for a long time.
* His practice of collecting fingers is likely the result of a vow.



## # Which person in fact is *papuji*?

* It is ambiguous between the second and third persons singular.
* A third possibility: it stands for the first person singular, *papujiÅ*, with loss of *anusvara*.

## # How does this discovery fit into the history of Indian religion?

* Fragmentary evidence for tantric practices before the seventh century A.D.
* Akgulimala's necklace of fingers as evidence for such practices in the Pali Canon.
* Tantra rests on identifying with a god in a literal sense, often through possession.
* Tantra also draws power from impurity, challenging brahminical norms of purity.

## # Tantric deities and their characteristics

* Deities worshipped by early tantrics were forms of Fiva and the Goddess (Devi).
* The Goddess has a mythology of her own, sometimes seen as Fiva's consort, sometimes more powerful in her own right.
* Fiva is associated with the darker side of life, a menacing outsider.

## # Kali and Mahakala

* Kali, 'the black one', frequents cemeteries and decorates herself with corpses.
* Mahakala, 'the great black one', can also mean 'Great Death'.
* The *Kali Tantra*, a relatively modern text, describes Kali adorned with human parts.

## # Kali in the Pali Canon

* A brief account of Kali in the *Thera-gath*a suggests she was similarly visualized over two thousand years ago.

## K. R. Norman Translates (Norman, 1969:20):

* The text presents two verses about Mahakala, a former merchant who became a Buddhist ascetic.

* The first verse describes Mahakala visualizing the goddess Kali dismembering corpses and wearing their parts as ornaments. This visualization is interpreted as representing his past life as a follower of Fiva/Fakta, a tantric tradition.
* The second verse reflects on the impermanence of the body and the potential for one's own corpse to be treated similarly after death.

## Other References to Fiva and Kali in the Pali Canon:

* Mentions of Fiva (*Sivo devaputto*) and *siva-vijj*a (knowledge related to cemetery practices) are found in the *SaÅyutta Nik*aya and *Digha Nik*aya, respectively.
* Isana, another name for Fiva, is mentioned as a king of gods in the *Dhajagga Sutta*.

## Mahefa and Kali:

* While "Mahefa" (a common Sanskrit name for Fiva) is not explicitly found in the Pali Canon, Norman suggests that *mahesakkha*, traditionally interpreted as meaning "of great power," might be derived from *mahefakhya* ("called Mahefa") and originally referred to Fiva.

* Kali is mentioned as Mara's sister in the *Mara-tajjaniya Sutta* and a nun named Cajdakali, known for her temper, is mentioned in the Vinaya Pitaka.
* These references suggest a satirical allusion to Kali's relationship with Mahakala.

## Akgulimala and Human Sacrifice:

* Although Akgulimala collected fingers from living victims, not corpses, Norman argues that this practice is plausible given Kali's association with robbers and human sacrifice in Indian tradition.
* The story of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang being targeted for sacrifice by river pirates further supports this connection.

## Buddhism and Tantra:

* For a thousand years, Buddhism in India was largely antithetical to tantra, particularly Faiva/Fakta tantra.
* Buddhism emphasized self-control, meditative states, and ethical principles, while tantra involved possession, impurity, and transgression of normal morality.

* However, around the time of Hiuen Tsiang's experience, Buddhism was significantly influenced by tantra, leading to the emergence of Vajrayana Buddhism.
* While Vajrayana incorporates elements of tantric practice, it remains grounded in Buddhist ethics, ultimately aiming for Enlightenment.
