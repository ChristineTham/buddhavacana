# About Hamburg Buddhist Studies

* Explains the historical context of Buddhist studies at the University of Hamburg. 
* Highlights the importance of understanding Buddhism in a globalized world.
* Emphasizes the interdisciplinary approach of the *Hamburg Buddhist Studies* series, aiming to engage a wider audience beyond specialists.

# About This Volume

* States that the book originated from a conference held at Hamburg University in 2017.
* Explains the central theme: exploring types of systematic doubt in Buddhism from various perspectives.
* Mentions the exploration of connections between Pyrrhonism and Buddhist scholasticism, as well as the skeptical nature of New and Critical Buddhism.



# Introduction

* Philosophical curiosity begins with questioning self-evident things.
* This volume explores the role of sceptical questions in Buddhist thought.
* Scepticism can be a way of life, a practical problem, or a theoretical problem.

# Manifestations of Scepticism in Buddhist Philosophy

* The volume examines scepticism in Buddhist philosophy from historical, philosophical, and comparative perspectives.
* It investigates whether Buddhist works display sceptical attitudes and the origins of these attitudes.
* It compares sceptical arguments in Buddhism with those in Western philosophy, particularly Pyrrhonism.

# Rationale for Examining Buddhist Philosophy through Scepticism

* Using a common terminology like scepticism can reveal intellectual relationships between Indian and Greek philosophy.
* Comparing Buddhist and Western philosophies can highlight theoretical similarities and differences.
* Studying modern trends in Buddhism that connect Buddhist doctrines to sceptical principles benefits from using Western notions of scepticism.

# Mark Siderits: "Buddhism and Scepticism"

* Argues that Buddhist philosophy does not employ sceptical strategies.
* Examines how Buddhist thinkers addressed issues that have been the subject of sceptical doubt in Western philosophy.
* Concludes that Buddhism generally argues for determinate views, even when its arguments may appear sceptical.

# Vincent Eltschinger: "Dharmakīrti and Academic Scepticism"

* Compares Dharmakīrti's epistemology to Hellenistic schools of thought.
* Argues that Dharmakīrti's attitude towards knowledge is closer to Stoic optimism than Academic scepticism.
* Both Dharmakīrti and the Academics used probabilism to deal with practical uncertainty.

# Ethan Mills: "Nāgārjuna as a Sceptic"

* Defends a two-phase reading of Nāgārjuna as a sceptic about philosophy.
* Argues that Nāgārjuna first argues for emptiness and then demonstrates that the idea of emptiness undermines all philosophical views, including itself.
* This interpretation is supported by other Buddhist thinkers like Candrakīrti, Kumārajīva, and mKhas-grub Dge-legs-dpal-bzang-po.

# Georgios Halkias: "Aristocles's Passage and the Madhyamaka Connection"

* Explores the historical link between Madhyamaka philosophy and Pyrrho's scepticism.
* Presents a Buddhist reading of the Aristocles Passage, which summarizes Pyrrho's ideas.
* Finds correspondences between the two systems in terms of goals, methods, and results.

# Adrian Kuzminski: "Pyrrhonian Scepticism and Early Buddhism"

* Proposes that Pyrrho obtained some of his philosophical principles from Indian Buddhism during his stay in the subcontinent.
* Compares Pyrrho's sceptical approach to knowledge with that of the Buddha.
* Argues that Pyrrho's thinking integrated elements found in India but not in Greece, resulting in a Pyrrhonian phenomenological atomism similar to Abhidharma *dharma* theory.

# Some Sceptical Doubts About "Buddhist Scepticism"

*  Mark Siderits argues against the idea of significant scepticism within Indian Buddhist philosophy.
* He distinguishes between ontological and epistemic scepticism, focusing on the latter in relation to Buddhism.
* Siderits differentiates between radical scepticism (denying knowledge) and Pyrrhonian scepticism (withholding judgement about knowledge).
* He points out that Buddhists are not sceptical about the existence of a self but affirm its non-existence, contrasting this with their belief in karma and rebirth.

#  Epistemological Internalism and Semantic Externalism

* The author explores radical scepticism's role in shaping metaphysical positions like subjective idealism.
* He contrasts Berkeley's argument for idealism, which relies on semantic internalism (meaning tied to direct mental access), with Vasubandhu's Yogācāra arguments against external world realism.
* Vasubandhu rejects the external-world disjunct based on metaphysical reasoning rather than semantic constraints.
* The author introduces semantic externalism as an alternative, arguing that meaning is determined by causal connections with external states of affairs, independent of individual knowledge.



# Semantic Externalism and Buddhist Thought

* The meaning of words depends on our sensory experiences and interactions with the world.
* If we are brains in vats (BIVs), the meaning of words will be different from that of flesh-and-blood humans.
* This difference in reference leads to two distinct languages: English and Vat-English.
* The sceptical hypothesis, which claims we might be BIVs, is self-refuting because it would lead to a contradiction regardless of which language we are speaking.

# Semantic Externalism and Yogācāra

* Applying semantic externalism to the Yogācāra claim that we might be series of *ālaya* consciousnesses leads to similar conclusions.
* The meaning of words would differ depending on whether we are experiencing reality directly or through the ripening of karmic seeds.
* This suggests that the Yogācāra buoyancy argument, which relies on the inability to distinguish between these two possibilities, is vulnerable to criticism based on semantic externalism.

# Buddhist Thought and Semantic Externalism

* The Buddhist concept of meaning being established through convention aligns with the externalist view that meanings are not individualistic but arise from social interaction and environmental context.
* This suggests a potential compatibility between Buddhist thought and semantic externalism.

# Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonian Scepticism

* Semantic externalism's refutation of radical sceptical hypotheses challenges the idea of using scepticism for revisionary metaphysical purposes.
* This might lead to the conclusion that metaphysics is futile, which aligns with certain interpretations of Madhyamaka philosophy.

# The *Avyākṛta* and Early Buddhism

* The Buddha's refusal to answer certain indeterminate questions (*avyākṛta*) has been interpreted as a form of scepticism.
* However, this interpretation may be incomplete. 
* The Buddha's silence could be seen as rejecting questions based on false presuppositions, such as the existence of a permanent self.

# Presupposition Failure Filter and Buddhist Reductionism

* The Buddha's use of negative catu*ṣkoṭ*i to address questions about the post-mortem status of enlightened persons can be understood through the concept of a "presupposition failure filter."
* This filter identifies and eliminates statements that lack semantic significance due to false presuppositions.
* It plays a crucial role in Buddhist Reductionism by separating conventional truth from ultimate truth.

# Madhyamaka and Semantic Non-Dualism

* Madhyamaka philosophy employs the presupposition failure filter to argue against the existence of ultimately real entities with intrinsic natures.
* This leads to a form of semantic non-dualism, where there is only one truth: the conventional.

# Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonian Scepticism

* While Madhyamaka shares some similarities with Pyrrhonian scepticism, such as aiming to quell inquiry into metaphysical matters, there are also significant differences.
* Both systems face self-refutation objections but address them differently.
* Nāgārjuna's strategy in the MMK resembles Sextus' approach in that it involves responding to specific realist views rather than presenting a master argument against all metaphysics.

# The Prolixities of Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism

* Both systems offer support for calling Madhyamaka a kind of scepticism.
* However, their aims differ: Sextus seeks tranquillity through suspending judgment, while Buddhists aim to eradicate the "I"-sense and achieve liberation from suffering.
* It's unclear how Pyrrhonian acquiescence in appearances could lead to such eradication.

# Kuzminski's Argument for Madhyamaka as Pyrrhonism

* Kuzminski argues that Madhyamaka shares similarities with Pyrrhonism, particularly in its rejection of dogmatic beliefs like karma and rebirth.
* This claim is difficult to reconcile with the emphasis on karmic causation in MMK 26.
* Kuzminski's interpretation of *nirvāṇ*a as indistinguishable from saṃsāra also faces challenges.

# A Better Candidate for Indian Pyrrhonism

* Given Kuzminski's description of Pyrrhonian skepticism, Lokāyata might be a better parallel to Pyrrhonism in India.
* However, Madhyamaka actively criticizes Lokāyata.

# Metaphysical Realism and Emptiness

* Pyrrhonian indifference towards the nature of reality behind appearances contrasts with Madhyamaka's doctrine of emptiness.
* While Pyrrhonism doesn't rule out metaphysical realism, Madhyamaka explicitly rejects it.

# Dependent Origination and Emptiness

* Some argue that dependent origination can be used to prove the emptiness of all things.
* This argument relies on a misunderstanding of *svabhāva*, which refers to inherent nature rather than existence.

# Nāgārjuna's Critique of Epistemology

* In VV, Nāgārjuna uses a sceptical strategy to argue against the possibility of establishing reliable epistemic instruments (*pramāṇ*as).
* This strategy highlights potential flaws in any attempt to validate knowledge.

# The Role of Luck in Epistemology

* A champion of *pramāṇa* epistemology might argue that luck plays a role in our epistemic achievements, but it can be minimized through reflective equilibrium.
* They would contend that seeking an ideal solution to epistemological challenges is rational despite the possibility of never fully achieving it.

# The Scope of Nāgārjuna's Critique

* It remains unclear whether Nāgārjuna's critique in VV targets only metaphysical realists or extends to other schools like Buddhist Reductionism.
* Later Madhyamikas found room for a theory of *pramāṇ*as at the conventional level, suggesting that epistemology can coexist with the doctrine of emptiness.

# Beyond Reasonable Doubt? A Note On Dharmakīrti And Scepticism*

* Madhyamaka is relevant to Buddhism and scepticism due to its similarities with Pyrrhonism: Nāgārjuna's tetralemma resembles Pyrrho's; his refusal to endorse positions aligns with Pyrrhonian skepticism; and his critiques of concepts like causality echo Aenesidemus.
* This paper focuses on Dharmakīrti, a prominent figure in Buddhist epistemology, rather than Madhyamaka. While later Mādhyamikas used his work, Dharmakīrti was not a Mādhyamika himself.

* Despite similarities between Madhyamaka and skepticism, Dharmakīrti's epistemology is closer to Stoicism, sharing assumptions about knowledge and its possibility. This can be compared to the relationship between Stoicism and scepticism, where Stoicism adopts a more dogmatic stance towards knowledge. 




## Contrasting Epistemologies

* **Dharmakīrti's Philosophy**
    *  Dharmakīrti's epistemology relies on perception and inference as reliable sources of knowledge.
    * Perception provides direct, unbiased access to reality, grasping bare particulars.
    * Inference corrects errors in perception and reveals the true nature of reality.
    * Reality is characterized by momentariness, selflessness, and painfulness.

* **Stoic Epistemology**
    * Stoicism emphasizes the rationality of the universe and the mind's ability to grasp truth.
    * *Sunkatathesis*, a key concept, describes the mind's assent to impressions from the senses, leading to knowledge.
    * These impressions are vivid and distinct from those in dreams or hallucinations.

* **Scepticism**
    * Arcesilaus, a Sceptic philosopher, challenged Stoic epistemology by arguing that impressions from true and false objects are indistinguishable.
    * He advocated for the suspension of judgment (*epochê peri pantôn*) due to the unknowability of things (*akatalêpsia*).
    * Arcesilaus emphasized the limitations of human experience and the obscurity of the world, contrasting with the Stoic and Dharmakīrti's use of light metaphors. 




## Life And Action

* One of the main objections against scepticism was its suspension of judgement, which made action impossible as it requires assent and impulsion.
* Arcesilaus argued that sensory impressions could not be avoided but assent wasn't necessary for action; he believed impressions naturally triggered an impulse towards them.
* He proposed reasonability as a criterion for right action, allowing individuals to act in the best possible way despite the fallibility of their judgements.

## Carneades' Alternative

* Carneades offered a more sophisticated alternative to Stoic assent by proposing "convincing impressions" as a criterion for decision-making.
* These impressions were those that strongly appeared true but could be false, allowing for a subjective and fallible basis for action.
* This approach aimed to make action possible without turning the bases of action into dogmas.

## Dharmakīrti's Perspective

* Like Hellenistic sceptics, Dharmakīrti had to account for the possibility of successful life and practice despite acknowledging the possibility of true knowledge.
* He distinguished between empirical reality, accessible through perception and inference, and transempirical states, which are intrinsically imperceptible.
* Religious practice, connected with the invisible, relied on a weaker epistemological criterion than that used for cognizing empirical reality.

## Everyday Activities and Uncertainty

* Dharmakīrti argued that individuals engage in activities like farming despite uncertainty about future results due to factors beyond their control.
* This uncertainty, termed "non-perception of something imperceptible," compels them to act without certainty regarding the existence or non-existence of desired outcomes.
* Śākyabuddhi, a commentator on Dharmakīrti's work, argued that rationality involves acting both out of certainty and doubt, as exemplified by farmers who act despite uncertainty about future harvests.

## Religious Practice and Scriptural Authority

* Dharmakīrti acknowledged three types of objects: perceptible, imperceptible hic and nunc, and intrinsically imperceptible.
* Ordinary human cognition is limited to the empirical realm, making it impossible to access transempirical states relevant to religious practice.
* This limitation necessitates reliance on scriptural authority for guidance on religious matters, as scriptures provide knowledge about invisible realms inaccessible through ordinary perception or inference.

## Choosing a Scripture

* Dharmakīrti recognized the challenge of choosing among various and often contradictory scriptures in ancient India's pluralistic religious landscape.
* He credited Dignāga with proposing critical examination as a means to evaluate scriptural authority, suggesting that individuals should assess scriptures before acting upon them.

# Dharmakīrti's Method of Critical Evaluation

* This method assesses the truth or falsity of statements in religious scriptures.
* A scripture can be considered reliable regarding supersensible matters if its statements about empirical facts are true and it doesn't contain internal contradictions.
* This reliability is inferred from the scripture's reliability in dealing with empirical matters.

# Application to Non-Buddhist Scriptures

* Dharmakīrti applied this method primarily to criticize non-Buddhist scriptures, particularly the Veda.
* He argued that the Veda contradicts itself and presents incorrect views on topics like the soul, permanence, and causality.
* He compared those who blindly accept the Veda's teachings despite its contradictions to unchaste women in their audacity.

# Dharmakīrti's Second Method

* This method considers a scripture reliable if it aligns with reality regarding central doctrinal points (like the Four Noble Truths).
* It assumes that since these core teachings are well-established, other teachings within the same scripture are likely also reliable.

# Problems with the Second Method

* Dharmakīrti questioned the formal validity of this second method, arguing that it relies on a flawed inference.
* He pointed out that words don't always correspond to reality and that assuming reliability based on some true statements doesn't guarantee the truthfulness of all statements within a scripture.

# Scripture as a Means of Valid Cognition

* Dharmakīrti ultimately relativized the epistemic status of scripture, arguing that it is not a full-fledged means of valid cognition in supersensible matters.
* He emphasized that even if someone is generally reliable, it doesn't mean all their statements are true, especially those concerning topics beyond reason's grasp.

# The Fallacy of "With a Remainder"

* Dharmakīrti criticized the inference used by some to justify the Veda's authority as being "with a remainder" (śeṣ*avat*).
* This type of inference assumes that because some parts of a text are true, all parts must be true, which is logically flawed.

# Nāgārjuna'S Scepticism About Philosophy

* Nāgārjuna is often interpreted in many ways due to seemingly contradictory tendencies in his texts: positive arguments for universal emptiness and negative encouragement to abandon all views.

* The author proposes a sceptical interpretation of Nāgārjuna, arguing that he uses arguments for emptiness to purge Buddhists of any view, even about emptiness itself.
* This interpretation is supported by the fact that it resolves the tension between Nāgārjuna's seemingly incompatible tendencies.

#  Nāgārjuna and Causation

* The author will use Nāgārjuna's discussion of causation in chapter 1 of the MMK as a case study to illustrate the strengths of the sceptical interpretation.

# Historical Context

* Nāgārjuna develops quietist strands of Early Buddhism while incorporating elements of analysis-insight strands.
* There are historical precedents for sceptical interpretations of Nāgārjuna in India, Tibet, and China.
* For Nāgārjuna, Buddhist practice itself constitutes a type of scepticism. This suggests a link between scepticism and religious practice that can contribute to broader discussions on the topic. 




## Scepticism About Philosophy

* This section introduces the concept of "scepticism about philosophy," which involves using philosophical methods to critique philosophy itself. 
* Examples of sceptics about philosophy include Sextus Empiricus, Zhuangzi, al-Ghazali, Maimonides, Montaigne, and Nāgārjuna.
* Sceptics about philosophy define their target based on their opponents' views rather than formulating their own definition of philosophy.

## Nāgārjuna'S Two Phases

* This section proposes that Nāgārjuna's philosophical approach has two phases:
    * **Phase one:** Offering arguments for emptiness and against essence (*svabhāva*).
    * **Phase two:** Demonstrating that the concept of emptiness undermines all philosophical views, including itself, leading to a state without any views or positions.

* This second phase is seen as the purging of philosophical impulses and the end of philosophy itself, making Nāgārjuna a sceptic about philosophy.
* While Nāgārjuna's texts move between these phases, there's a tendency towards phase two, especially in later parts of his work.

## Addressing Objections

* This section addresses the objection that claiming to have no claims is self-refuting or logically inconsistent. 
* It draws an analogy with Pyrrhonism, arguing that scepticism is a practice rather than a theoretical position and therefore not subject to the Law of Non-Contradiction.
* Nāgārjuna's texts are seen as part of a therapeutic practice aimed at pacifying conceptual proliferation (*prapañcopaśama*), which involves letting go of attachments to views and concepts.

## Prapañcopaśama: The Pacification of Conceptual Proliferation

* This section explores the concept of *prapañcopaśama*, which is central to Nāgārjuna's philosophy.
* It explains that *prapañca* refers to the expansion, development, or manifestation of concepts and language, often associated with unnecessary and harmful attachments.
* The pacification of *prapañca* is seen as the goal of phase two, leading to a state free from the desire for philosophical theories and conceptual constructions.

## Conclusion

* This section summarizes the argument that Nāgārjuna is a sceptic about philosophy who aims to lead people beyond the need for philosophical views.
* It highlights the importance of taking both phases of Nāgārjuna's philosophy seriously and suggests that his skepticism allows for a unified understanding of his work.

## The Cause Of Scepticism: The Critique Of Causation

* Nāgārjuna aims to dismantle the impulse to theorize about causation, not offer an alternative theory.
* He uses a *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma) to argue against four options for how things arise: from itself, from another, from both, or from no cause.

## The Four Options of Causation

* **Option One:** An arisen being arises from itself (held by the Sāṃkya school). Nāgārjuna argues that this is impossible because the essence (*svabhāva*) of the effect is not found in its conditions (*pratyaya*).
* **Option Two:** An arisen being arises from something else (held by Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, and Abhidharma Buddhists). Nāgārjuna presents two arguments against this:

    * If the essence of the effect is not found in its conditions, then the essence of the other (*parabhāva*) is also not found. It's unclear how the two separate essences are related without a causal power.
    * The concept of a causal power (*kriyā*) leads to an infinite regress because it requires another relation to explain its own origin.

## Nāgārjuna's Critique


* Nāgārjuna rejects the idea of causal powers and argues that there is no way to establish a clear relationship between cause and effect.
* He uses logical arguments and the concept of *svabhāva* (essence) to deconstruct traditional theories of causation.

# Nāgārjuna's Argument Against Causation

* Nāgārjuna presents arguments against various theories of causation found in Buddhist thought.
* He critiques the idea that effects arise from themselves (self-causation) and the notion of causal power (*kriyā*).
* He uses the "argument from the three times" to challenge the temporal relationship between cause and effect.

# Option Three: A Combination of Self-Causation and External Causation

* Nāgārjuna doesn't explicitly address this option but implies it wouldn't work given his arguments against self-causation and external causation.

# Option Four: No Cause at All

* Nāgārjuna also doesn't directly address this option, but suggests it's either absurd or fails to provide any explanation for causes and conditions.

# Nāgārjuna's Arguments Against Specific Causal Theories

* He targets various causal theories related to material cause (*hetu*), object of cognition (*ālambana*), immediately preceding cause (*anantara*), and dominant cause (*ādhipateya*).
* Similar arguments are presented concerning the effect (*phala*).

# Nāgārjuna's Intention

* His arguments against causation are negative, aimed at undermining existing causal theories.
* He ultimately aims to lead readers towards emptiness and mental peace by abandoning all views.


# Buddhist Scepticism: Religiosity Without Belief

* Some may question how a sceptic like Nāgārjuna can be considered a Buddhist philosopher.
* The author argues that Nāgārjuna's scepticism aligns with the quietist tradition in Buddhism, which emphasizes the cessation of conceptualization as a path to enlightenment.

# Two Tendencies in Buddhist Philosophy

* One tendency focuses on gaining insight into reality through analysis and classification.
* The other, represented by quietism, seeks liberation through the abandonment of all views.

# Nāgārjuna's Synthesis

* Nāgārjuna combines these two tendencies by using analytical methods to ultimately achieve a state of mental quietude free from conceptualization.

# Scepticism and Religiosity

* The author argues that Nāgārjuna's scepticism doesn't contradict Buddhism but rather offers a unique path to religious experience through the relinquishment of beliefs.
* This approach is compared to Pyrrhonian scepticism, where piety can exist without belief.

## Historical Precedents

* Candrakīrti's commentary on Nāgārjuna's MMK verse 25.24 exemplifies "phase two" by focusing on the cessation of conceptual proliferation as *nirvāṇ*.

* Kumārajīva, who transmitted Madhyamaka to China, may have held a sceptical understanding of Nāgārjuna, viewing negation as a therapeutic device rather than a descriptive tool. His student Sengzhao expressed similar ideas about emptiness and stillness of mind.

* The Tibetan tradition offers clearer examples of sceptical interpretations. Khedrupjey refuted an opponent who claimed Prāsaṅgika Mādhyamikas lacked beliefs or systems, highlighting the existence of radical sceptics within this tradition.
* Patsab Nyimadrak, a 12th-century philosopher, epitomizes a sceptical approach. He believed Mādhyamikas should expose contradictions in opposing views without affirming any truth claims themselves.

Patsab saw Madhyamaka notions like the two truths as therapeutic tools for undermining views. He rejected emptiness as an object of inference or perception, ultimately aiming for a cessation of attempts to cognize reality, which he considered "wisdom."




## Conclusion

* This chapter defends an interpretation of Nāgārjuna as a sceptic about philosophy.
* Nāgārjuna's philosophical activity takes place in two phases:
    * Phase one: Supporting the thesis of universal emptiness and criticizing alternative views.
    * Phase two: Demonstrating that the thesis of emptiness undermines itself along with all competing philosophical theories, leaving a thorough Mādhyamika in a state of pacification of conceptual proliferation with no view, thesis, or theory at all.

* This interpretation can make sense of Nāgārjuna's critiques of causation and defends the prospects for Buddhist scepticism.
* Some contemporary philosophers may find this interpretation uninteresting because it portrays Nāgārjuna as uninterested in constructive philosophy. 
* However, the author argues that this interpretation renders Nāgārjuna philosophically interesting in three senses:

    * It allows him to take his place alongside Jayarāśi and Śrīharṣa in the Indian chapter of the history of philosophical scepticism.
    * As a Buddhist sceptic, Nāgārjuna gives us material for further inquiries into the relation between scepticism and religion and whether sceptical religiosity is viable in the 21st century.
    * A sceptical Nāgārjuna prompts serious metaphilosophical reflections on the uses (and abuses) of philosophical practice, including interpretations of his own texts.

* Argues that both philosophies share a common goal of achieving inner peace and tranquility through the abandonment of fixed beliefs.
* Traces the roots of this shared philosophy back to Pyrrho of Elis, the founder of Pyrrhonism.
* Suggests that the contemplative method of Pyrrhonism aligns with the liberational goals of Buddhism. 




## A Man Of Windless Calm

* Pyrrho accompanied his teacher, the philosopher Anaxarchus of Abdera, during Alexander's Asian campaigns.
* They spent time in Bactria and northwest India, interacting with Iranian Zoroastrian priests and Indian gymnosophists (naked masters).
* These encounters influenced Pyrrho's philosophy, leading him to promote "ineffability" and the "suspension of assertions" about moral judgments.

## Pyrrho's Teachings

* Pyrrho's teachings emphasized "antinomial methods of contemplation," "equanimity towards all assertions," "indifference towards their differentiation," and "moderation towards desires and wants."
* He advocated for the suspension of prejudice and judgment, verbal abstinence, and the attainment of *ataraxia*, a state free from mental and emotional turmoil.

## Pyrrho's Transformation

* Pyrrho is described as transforming from an unknown student into a revered teacher after his experiences in the East.
* He was praised for his exemplary lifestyle and seen as a guide who helped others recognize their divinity.
* Sextus Empiricus, a later Pyrrhonian philosopher, noted that Pyrrho embodied his philosophy in a more physically manifest way than his successors.

## The Aristocles Passage

* Bett (2000) acknowledges that Pyrrho's unique contribution was combining *ataraxia* with the indeterminacy thesis.
* Pyrrho drew from Greek philosophy but did not promote epistemic indeterminacy for self-promotion or materialist teleology like Democritus.
* Sextus Empiricus distinguishes Democritus's philosophy from scepticism, emphasizing the latter's suspension of judgment and attainment of *ataraxia*.

## The Aristocles Passage: Source and Interpretation

* Our knowledge of Pyrrho comes primarily from Timon of Phlius's summary preserved by Aristocles of Messene in his *History of Philosophy*.
* Bett (2018) argues that the Aristocles Passage (AP), though transmitted through multiple sources, likely reflects Pyrrho's thought faithfully.

## The Aristocles Passage: Content and Analysis

* The AP focuses on investigating our capacity for knowledge rather than the nature of reality itself.
* Pyrrho is presented as advocating for a suspension of judgment about the world to achieve *ataraxia*.
* The author proposes a Buddhist reading of the AP, highlighting its congruence with Buddhism as a soteriological enterprise.

## The Aristocles Passage: Structure and Themes

* Timon outlines a coherent system in the AP structured around three questions (Q1-Q3) relating to the nature of things, our disposition towards them, and the outcome of this disposition.
* These questions correspond to "base/view," "path/practice," and "fruit/benefits" respectively.
* The responses (R1a-R3c) provide a framework for achieving *ataraxia* through suspending judgment about the world.

## The View: [Q1] What Is The Nature Of "Things" (Πράγματα)?

* Pyrrho uses *pragmata* to refer to both phenomena and noumena, encompassing a range of elements.
* Pyrrho argues that sense-derived conceptions about phenomena do not support rigid outlooks or dogmas (*δόξα*) concerning their nature.
* He believes phenomena appear variable, indeterminate, and unqualifiable, suggesting reality is dependently arising without fixed essence.

## The Path: [Q2] What Disposition Ought We To Cultivate In Order To Relate To Pragmata?

* Pyrrho advises against clinging to interpretations and remaining impartial and unpersuaded by phenomenal appearances.
* He suggests not believing anything is more or less than it is, both is and is not, or neither is nor is not.
* This aligns with Buddhist teachings that emphasize the unreliability of sense perceptions and the need for impartiality.
* Pyrrho recommends remaining without stubborn beliefs, impartial, and unwavering, mirroring the Buddhist concept of a brahmin who does not grasp any view as supreme.
* He instructs against making any claims about the nature of *pragmata*, employing the tetralemma (*τετράλημμα*) to illustrate this point.

## The Fruit: [Q3] What Is The Outcome If We Adopt This Path Of Training?

*  The application of sceptical instructions leads to verbal abstinence, inner serenity, and bliss.
* Sceptical training facilitates states of speechlessness (non-assertion), tranquillity (freedom from perturbations), and pleasure.
* Pleasure is understood as a by-product of introspective practice, similar to the bliss experienced in Buddhist meditation.
* Pyrrhonists train to maintain awareness of subjective appearances, recognizing that sense data are indistinguishable and unqualifiable.

*  This leads to suspending convictions and avoiding extremes, akin to Buddhist wisdom (prajñā) and its associated happiness and bliss.
* Both Buddhism and Pyrrhonism view a state free from agitation as the natural condition of a mind free from dogmatic assertions and attachments.

* Sextus Empiricus argues that tranquillity (*ataraxia*) is fortuitous, following upon the suspension of judgment (*epochē*).
* He uses the analogy of Apelles's painting to illustrate how *ataraxia* arises unexpectedly as a consequence of suspending judgment.

## On Divinity And Goodness

* Pyrrho's fragment on truthful speech, correct standard, and the nature of divinity and goodness has led to debate among scholars about its meaning.
* The fragment suggests that living a balanced life involves aligning oneself with qualities like spiritual excellence and benevolence.

## Pyrrho's Teachings and Conventional Morality

* Pyrrho believed in holding conventional standards for living, recognizing that ultimate truth may be inaccessible through language.
* He likely taught that the nature of divinity and goodness serves as a guide for leading an equable life.

## Parallels with Buddhism

* Both Pyrrhonism and Buddhism emphasize compassion and aim to alleviate suffering.
* Sextus Empiricus compares Pyrrhonist teachers to physicians who use different methods tailored to individual needs, similar to the Buddha's approach in teaching the Dharma.

## A Shared Philosophical Ground

* Despite differences, Pyrrho's vision can be understood through a Buddhist lens, highlighting shared goals of achieving serenity and liberation from suffering.
* Both traditions emphasize practical methods for attaining these goals, suggesting a common philosophical ground despite their distinct origins.

# The Evident and the Non-Evident: Buddhism through the Lens of Pyrrhonism 

* Pyrrhonism is an ancient Greek therapeutic philosophy founded by Pyrrho of Elis.
* Pyrrho encountered Indian Gymnosophists and Magi during his travels with Alexander the Great, which influenced his philosophy.
* Pyrrhonism advocates for suspending judgment about the nature of experience, leading to *ataraxia* (peace of mind).

#  Pyrrhonism: A Reconstruction 

* Pyrrhonists were seekers or inquirers, not doubters like modern skeptics.
* They distinguished between evident experiences (immediate thoughts and sensations) and non-evident things (about which doubt is possible).
* Pyrrhonists rejected both positive and negative dogmatism, accepting only evident experiences.

# The Nature of Appearances 

* Pyrrhonists believe that immediate appearances are involuntary and cannot be denied.
* They argue that the significance of appearances depends on the context in which they appear.
* Error arises not from appearances themselves but from our interpretations of them.





# Interpretation and Uncertainty

* Our interpretations are inherently uncertain, even if they seem reliable (e.g., smoke as a sign of fire).
* Pyrrhonists believe that the experience itself is not wrong, but our interpretation of it can be.

# The Nature of Experience

* We experience both evident things (immediate sensations and thoughts) and previously evident things as non-evident.
* We notice absences as well as presences in our experiences.

# Sextus Empiricus's Classification of *Pragmata*

* **Manifestly evident:** Immediate, involuntary thoughts and sensations (e.g., a blue sky).
* **Temporarily non-evident:** Things that are not currently present but could be (e.g., thinking about Athens while in Rome).
* **Practically non-evident:** Things we cannot determine even though we can see they could be determined (e.g., whether stars are odd or even in number).
* **Inherently non-evident:** Absences that are "everlastingly hidden away" (e.g., God, Soul, Void).

# The Inherently Non-Evident

* These things exist only as imaginings, not as sensations.
* We can imagine them, but they never appear in our sensory experience.
* Examples include the Soul, Nature, God, and the Void.

# Belief vs. Pyrrhonian Suspension of Judgment

* Dogmatists believe in inherently non-evident things because they can imagine them.
* Pyrrhonists suspend judgment on these things because they lack empirical verification.
* They acknowledge that we cannot know if they exist or not, only that they are absent from our sensations.

# Absence and Indeterminacy

* Inherently non-evident things represent pure absence, shaped by no prior presence.
* Signs for these things lack determinate referents because there is no independent appearance to confirm them.
* This leads to conflicts and opposing views because beliefs about inherently non-evident things are based on faith rather than knowledge.

# Pyrrhonism and Peace of Mind

* By suspending judgment about all inherently non-evident things, Pyrrhonists find relief from conflict and achieve peace of mind (*ataraxia*).
* They accept uninterpreted appearances and the indeterminate absence that accompanies them.

# Sources of Pyrrhonism

* Diogenes Laërtius claims Pyrrho's philosophy was influenced by Indian gymnosophists.
* Western scholars often attribute it to Greek traditions like Democritus, Megarians, and Cyrenaics.
* The debate continues about the extent of Indian influence on Pyrrhonism.

# Pyrrhonism and Indian Influence

* Pyrrhonism's dialectical, ethical, psychological, and language-critical levels likely originated in Greece before Alexander's visit to India.
* Pyrrho may have incorporated some Indian thought into his existing beliefs.

# Democritus and Pyrrhonism

* Democritus taught the nondifference of phenomena and a eudaimonistic approach to philosophy, which are also found in Pyrrhonism.
* Some scholars argue that Democritus's influence on Pyrrho is stronger than any Buddhist influence.
* Evidence includes Democritus's use of "no more" (similar to Pyrrhonian thought) and his emphasis on the relativity of perception.

# Sextus Empiricus on Democritus and Cyrenaics

* Sextus Empiricus distinguishes Pyrrhonism from Democritus, labeling the latter a dogmatist due to his belief in atoms and void.
* Sextus also differentiates Pyrrhonism from Cyrenaicism, which focuses on pleasure as the aim, while Pyrrhonism seeks tranquility.

# Democritus's Own Words

* Democritus himself made a distinction between genuine knowledge (obtained through finer investigation) and bastard knowledge (derived from senses).
* This dogmatic view contrasts with the Pyrrhonian suspension of judgment about external reality.

# A Phenomenalistic Atomism

* The author proposes an alternate reading of Pyrrhonism, suggesting it adopted a phenomenalistic atomism influenced by Democritus but transformed to focus on thoughts and sensations as atoms within consciousness.
* This is illustrated through the analogy of letters in an alphabet, where individual letters have no meaning until combined into words.

# Distinguishing Pyrrhonism from Other Schools

* The author argues that Pyrrhonism's phenomenalistic atomism sets it apart from other Greek schools like Democriteans and Cyrenaics.
* While Democriteans were atomists without being phenomenalists, and Cyrenaics were phenomenalists without being atomists, Pyrrhonists embraced both aspects.

# Pyrrho's Encounter with Indian Thought

* The author suggests that Pyrrho encountered a non-dogmatic phenomenalism among Indian gymnosophists, possibly Buddhists, which influenced his thinking.
* This encounter may have led him to recast dependent origination into atomistic terms, resulting in a "Greek reinvention of Buddhism."




# Dependent Origination

* The concept of dependent origination emphasizes that the elements of our experience are not explained by separate entities or forces.
* *Dharma*s, the phenomenal atoms in Buddhism, are understood as sensations and thoughts that are constantly changing and interconnected.
* Buddhist scholars have debated the exact number and nature of *dharma*s, but they generally agree that they constitute the flow of experience.

# Pyrrhonism and Buddhism

* Pyrrho, a Greek philosopher, developed a school of thought called Pyrrhonism, which emphasized the suspension of judgment about matters that are inherently non-evident.
* Pyrrhonists believed that appearances (phenomena) are all we can truly know, and that dogmatic beliefs about things beyond appearances are ultimately unfounded.

* The author suggests that Pyrrhonism offers a useful lens for understanding early Buddhism.

# Parallels Between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism

* Both Pyrrhonism and Buddhism emphasize the interconnectedness and impermanence of phenomena.
* Both reject clinging to dogmatic beliefs, seeing them as sources of suffering.
* Both advocate for an open-minded inquiry into experience, based on evidence rather than preconceived notions.
* Both aim for a state of tranquility and liberation from suffering through the understanding of the nature of reality.

# Conclusion

The author argues that Pyrrhonism provides valuable insights into the core tenets of early Buddhism, particularly its emphasis on dependent origination, the rejection of dogmatic beliefs, and the pursuit of enlightenment through the direct experience of phenomena.

# The Buddhist Equivalent of Belief

* To believe something is to be attached to it.
* Attachment is indistinguishable from belief.
* Both Buddhists and Pyrrhonists see beliefs as intentional human activities that create fictional entities.

# Rejection of Dogmatisms

* Pyrrhonists reject positive and negative dogmatisms, while Buddhists reject eternalism and annihilationism.
* Eternalists are like Pyrrhonists' positive dogmatists, believing in permanent entities.
* Annihilationists are like Pyrrhonists' negative dogmatists, denying the existence of anything permanent.

# The Middle Path

* Buddhists accept appearances as interdependent, neither absolutely existing nor nonexistent.
* Pyrrhonists also embrace a middle path between positive and negative dogmatisms, seeing appearances as contingent and contextual.
* Both emphasize appearances over concepts and promote phenomena-based inquiry.

# Suspension of Judgement

* Pyrrhonists suspend judgment due to incompatible interpretations of the non-evident.
* Buddhists similarly avoid speculating on inherently non-evident matters like the nature of the self or afterlife.
* Both focus on what is evident, avoiding fictional entities that interrupt experience.

# Appearances as Their Own Criterion

* Pyrrhonists refuse to interpret appearances, taking them at face value.
* Buddhists see appearances as "empty," lacking hidden content that explains them.
* Both view interpretations and fictional entities as distractions from understanding appearances directly.

# Ataraxia and Liberation

* Pyrrhonist *ataraxia*, or imperturbability, is comparable to Buddhist liberation or enlightenment.
* Both result from deconstructing beliefs and accepting the dependent origination of appearances.
* This leads to peace by freeing oneself from the anxiety of belief and uncertainty.

# Right Conduct and Piety

* Pyrrhonists and Buddhists live "by what is apparent" and practice right conduct/piety.
* This involves following evident experience without belief or interpretation, accepting experiences as they are.
* It includes compassion for all real-life experiences, even those of believers.

## Scripture and Scepticism in Vasubandhu's Exegetical Method

* **Vasubandhu's approach to skepticism regarding Buddhist scriptures:**
    * Recognizes philosophical difficulties that arise when critically examining Buddhist scriptures.
    * Allows for skepticism but seeks to preserve the authority of scriptures.
    * Converts religious scepticism into epistemological scepticism, which doubts our ability to accurately access truths conveyed by scriptures rather than denying those truths themselves.

* **Two types of scepticism:**
    * Religious scepticism: Misguided and rooted in cognitive or affective error.
    * Epistemological scepticism: Concerns the way scriptures are interpreted and apprehended.

* **Vasubandhu's exegetical strategy:**
    * Serves a tradition that values its scriptures while subjecting them to rational inquiry.
    * Employs hermeneutical tools like distinguishing between explicit and implicit meaning, special intentions, and hidden ornaments.

* **Three perspectives on scepticism in Vasubandhu's work:**
    * Methodological remarks about the epistemological status of scriptures and how they should be approached.
    * Theory of exegesis as seen in his *Vyākhyāyukti*.
    * Application of these ideas in his commentaries, considering both pedagogical and philosophical contexts.

* **Pedagogical context:** Teacher elucidates scripture to resolve sceptical objections from disciples.
* **Philosophical debate context:** Scriptures are used to support arguments or weaken opponents' positions.
* **Pyrrhonian problematic:** Vasubandhu's approach in polemical exegesis brings him up against the Pyrrhonian problem of inability to resolve disagreements without begging the question.

## Meta-Theory: Between Devotion And Doubt

* Vasubandhu's reflections on Buddhist scriptures exhibit both skeptical and devotional attitudes.
* He acknowledges the potential for misunderstanding scriptures due to the absence of the Buddha and other realized beings.
* Scriptures are considered reliable, but human understanding may fail to grasp their true meaning.
* Vasubandhu emphasizes that scepticism should be directed towards our reception of scriptures, not the texts themselves.

## Scepticism as Pedagogical Tool

* Vasubandhu views sceptical objections in a pedagogical setting as beneficial for enhancing understanding and fostering devotion.
* Objections are seen as provisional and ultimately resolved in harmony with the scriptures.
* This approach is described as "devoted criticism," where criticism aims to restore faith through rational inquiry.

## Defending Mahāyāna Scriptures

* Vasubandhu defends the authenticity of Mahāyāna scriptures against accusations of being apocryphal.
* He argues that sceptical objections to Mahāyāna doctrines are based on misinterpretations or misunderstandings of the scriptures.
* His exegetical approach aims to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of these scriptures.

## Distinguishing Buddhist and Non-Buddhist Scriptures

* Vasubandhu's method of scriptural interpretation primarily applies to Buddhist scriptures, as non-Buddhist scriptures are often rejected outright.
* He attributes scepticism towards Buddhist scriptures to misjudgements on the part of the sceptic, such as literal interpretations of non-literal utterances or fixation on words rather than meaning.

## Reconciling Devotion and Doubt


* Vasubandhu reconciles skepticism and devotion by suggesting that questioning scriptural knowledge claims arises from flawed human understanding.
* While Buddhist scriptures are considered essentially unerring, a skeptical attitude towards our interpretation of them is seen as justified and philosophically healthy.

## Theory: Doubts And Objections In The Vyākhyāyukti

* Vasubandhu addresses the issue of questioning scripture content in his work, the VY.
* He distinguishes between doubt and objections as responses to scriptural claims.

## Doubt

* Doubt is considered an unwholesome state of mind to be abandoned.
* It arises from ignorance and is associated with childishness, delusion, and lack of wisdom.
* Vasubandhu believes that removing doubt leads to happiness and well-being.
* Doubt is not seen as a useful approach for assessing knowledge claims.

## Objections

* Objections are incorporated as an essential element in teaching the Dharma.
* They are presented alongside replies, suggesting they serve as springboards for resolution.
* Objections can be classified into three types: those concerning meaning, words, and reasoning.
* Vasubandhu provides examples of each type of objection.
* Objections, unlike doubt, are grounded in logical claims and rational thinking.

## The Difference Between Doubt and Objections

* Doubt is portrayed as prejudiced and rationally unjustifiable scepticism.
* Objections are a form of scepticism that can be rationally defended or responded to.
* Objections ultimately validate Buddhist scripture by demonstrating that they can overcome misunderstandings.
* According to the VY, scepticism is warranted when assessing scriptural claims, but doubt is misguided.

## Pedagogical Applications: Sceptical Arguments In The Dharmadhar-Matāvibhāgavṛtti

* This section discusses how Vasubandhu uses scepticism in his commentary (*DhDhVV*) on Maitreya's work, which outlines the Madhyamaka school's theory of emptiness.
*  Vasubandhu employs a pedagogical strategy where he anticipates and addresses potential objections to Maitreya's doctrines, thereby clarifying them further.

## Objections and Responses in the DhDhVV

* The *DhDhVV* features a dialogue format where a hypothetical listener raises objections to Maitreya's teachings, and Vasubandhu, as the commentator, provides responses.
* Many objections focus on the nature of *dharma*s (phenomena) and *dharmatā* (their true essence), their relationship, and ontological status.

## Addressing Objections Regarding Dharma and Dharmatā

* One objection concerns whether *dharma*s truly lack both existence and appearance. Vasubandhu argues that both properties are necessary for the misperception of reality to occur.
* Another objection questions if everything can be reduced to just *dharma*s and *dharmatā*. Vasubandhu clarifies that these two categories encompass all phenomena, using the analogy of aggregates, elements, and sense spheres being ultimately reducible to them.

## The Nature of Appearance

* A listener inquires how something non-existent can appear. Vasubandhu compares it to illusions like magician's elephants, emphasizing that appearance doesn't equate to existence.
* Another objection focuses on the ontological relation between *dharma*s and *dharmatā*. Vasubandhu argues they are neither the same nor different, using the concept of existence and non-existence being both distinct and not distinct.

## Conclusion: Understanding Over Credibility

* Vasubandhu's approach suggests that objections to scriptural testimony often stem from misunderstanding.
* By addressing these objections, a deeper understanding of the scriptures and doctrines emerges.
* Ultimately, when the credibility of scriptures is questioned, it is human understanding that should be scrutinized.

## Argumentative Applications: Contested Scriptures In The Abhidhar-Makośabhāṣya

* This text focuses on how Vasubandhu, in his work *Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (AKBh)*, deals with disagreements and doubts regarding scriptural interpretation.

*  The *AKBh* is a polemical work where Vasubandhu engages in hermeneutical analysis of sūtra fragments to address objections raised by his philosophical opponents.
* Some sūtra fragments are accepted without question, while others spark debate. In one instance, the authority of a sūtra is disputed, leading to an impasse and a sceptical remark from Vasubandhu acknowledging the limitations of resolving exegetical disagreements definitively.

## Objections against the interpretation of sūtra passages

* Vasubandhu and his opponents raise objections to each other's interpretations of scriptures, targeting the understanding rather than the truth conveyed by the scriptures themselves.
* Vasubandhu often criticizes his opponents for misinterpreting scriptures due to cognitive biases like fixating on literal meanings or seeking implicit meanings where explicit ones are intended.

## The Hermeneutical Dichotomy of Explicit and Implicit Meaning

* A deeper level of scepticism arises concerning the criteria for determining when scriptures should be interpreted literally versus implicitly.
* This issue is highlighted in a debate about dependent origination, where Vasubandhu criticizes the Vaibhāṣika's reification of states within the process, arguing that they misinterpret a sūtra defining ignorance as "non-knowledge related to the past."
* The Vaibhāṣika counter by claiming the sūtra defines ignorance implicitly as a *dharma*, highlighting the difficulty in applying hermeneutical methods consistently and reliably. 




# Vasubandhu's Hermeneutics and Scepticism

* Vasubandhu assumes that expositions in Buddhist scriptures indicate explicit meaning.
* The Vaibhāṣika school challenges this assumption, arguing that some expositions require further explication.
* Vasubandhu defends his position by claiming that the interlocutor misunderstands the exposition.
* This disagreement leads to a circular reasoning problem, highlighting the limitations of both sides' arguments.

# Vasubandhu and Scepticism

* Despite engaging with sceptical arguments, Vasubandhu does not advocate for suspending judgement on scriptural knowledge.
* He believes that true meaning can be revealed through proper exegetical procedures, even though only Buddhas have direct experience of these truths.
* Vasubandhu's approach resembles external coherentism or reliabilism, where the truth of scriptures is accessible through reliable methods of interpretation.

# Scepticism in Scriptural Commentary

* For Vasubandhu, scepticism plays a crucial role in scriptural commentary by directing it towards understanding Buddhist teachings and addressing potential misunderstandings.
* Both teachers and students may raise sceptical objections regarding scriptural authority, which can be addressed through further learning or used to solidify knowledge claims.

# Reasoning and Scripture as Sources of Knowledge

* Vasubandhu presents a nuanced view of the relationship between reasoning and scripture in acquiring liberating knowledge.
* While reasoning is essential for interpreting scriptures, it is fallible. Scriptures, on the other hand, are inherently sources of truth, regardless of whether they are correctly understood.

# Sceptical Buddhism As Provenance And Project*

*  Examines links between "secular," "critical," "sceptical," and "radical" Buddhism as possibilities for rethinking Buddhism in the 21st century.
* Explores whether "sceptical" Buddhism can coexist with Buddhist *praxis*, considering its implications for addressing suffering in a globalized world.
* Positions itself as a work in progress, reflecting the author's personal biases and research interests.

# Sceptical Buddhism?

* Discusses philosophical scepticism's relationship to epistemology, contrasting it with ordinary doubt and religious reform.
* Highlights Pyrrhonian scepticism's rejection of assent to non-evident propositions, including the proposition that knowledge is impossible.
* Notes that while Pyrrhonian scepticism avoids dogmatism, it doesn't necessarily reject epistemology altogether but rather sets it aside.

# Batchelor'S Secular Buddhism

* Introduces Stephen Batchelor's "secular Buddhism," which demythologizes traditional Buddhism for a contemporary audience.
* Emphasizes that Batchelor's secular Buddhism is not simply a stripped-down, self-help version of the Dharma but aims to retain its ethical core.
*  Draws on Batchelor's book *After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for a Secular Age*, which builds upon his earlier work *Buddhism without Beliefs*. 




## Indeed, He Argues,

* Mindfulness taken out of its original context could reinforce self-isolation by shielding practitioners from unsettling emotions.

## Instead of imagining a dharma that erects even firmer barriers around the alienated self, let us imagine one that works toward a re-enchantment of the world.

* Batchelor proposes a "middle way" between dogmatic faith and unreflective atheism.
* He seeks an essence for secular Buddhism in early texts, highlighting a "skeptical voice" that avoids making ontological assertions.
* This approach emphasizes practical knowledge leading to behavioral changes over theoretical knowledge.

## Beyond the appeal to an "ideality of origins," here we see Batchelor make an explicit connection between secular Buddhism and what we might call a "realist" or even "pragmatist" approach to knowledge.

* He cites Trevor Ling's observation that Buddhism began as a culture that evolved into an organized religion, suggesting this insight can inform modern secular Buddhism.
* Batchelor envisions Buddhism as a comprehensive way of being in the world, transcending limitations of "religion" and traditional social structures.

## One of Batchelor's most insightful suggestions—and one that draws his work into conversation with the Critical Buddhist movement, addressed below—is his discussion of the "critical" aspect of Buddhist teachings.

* He argues that following the Buddhadharma is difficult because it "goes against the stream" of our reactivity.
* Entering the eightfold path requires overcoming instinctive drives, social conditioning, and psychological inclinations.
* Nirvana becomes an "opening of a space" for true freedom by moving beyond these limitations.

## At first glance, this sounds plausible, but by associating all of these negative traits with "the legacy of biological evolution," Batchelor may here be replacing one set of "myths" with another.

* While acknowledging the role of social conditioning, Batchelor emphasizes resisting our evolutionary heritage.
* He views greed and hatred as physical drives rooted in our limbic system, stemming from survival advantages for humans as a species.

## Can a truly "sceptical" Buddhism keep to the ethical—some would argue *political*—imperative of the Buddhist path; namely, the commitment to the liberation of all beings from suffering? 

* Batchelor hints at a broader political vision when he defines *dukkha* as anything that impedes human flourishing.
* He includes societal factors like patriarchal culture, despotic governments, oppressive religions, and poverty as contributors to suffering.





## Critical Buddhism: "Buddhism Is Criticism"

* **Critical Buddhism's Core Arguments:**

    * Early Buddhism was based on rational, skeptical, and humanistic principles.
    * These critical aspects have diminished in many branches of Asian Buddhism, particularly Zen traditions.
    * Contemporary Buddhism needs a "critical reformation" through textual scholarship and comparative analysis, drawing from Western thought like Descartes.

* **Critical vs. Topical Thinking:**

    * Critical thinking involves clear distinctions and combats discrimination by promoting logical/ethical discernment.
    * Topicalism (or *dhātu-vāda*) emphasizes a singular, real locus (*dhātu*) as the foundation of reality, neglecting critical differentiation between truth and falsity.

* **Faith and Scepticism in Critical Buddhism:**

    * Critical Buddhism is not simply Cartesian rationalism but is grounded in Buddhist doctrines like *pratītyasamutpāda*.
    * It involves faith in these doctrines while using intellect and language to judge their meaning and application.
    * A limited form of skepticism exists, but it's secondary to the ethical goal of Buddhist practice.

* **The Purpose of Buddhism:**

    * Critical Buddhism focuses on "the clear discrimination of phenomena" (*dharma-pravicaya*) as a method rather than an end in itself.
    * The ultimate goal is "the realization of 'wisdom' (*bodhi*) for the practice of 'great compassion' (*mahākaruṇā*)".
    * This shift emphasizes constructive ethics and soteriology, requiring a degree of certainty to ground criticism as a basis for ethical action. 




## Radical Buddhism

* This section introduces the author's previous work on Critical Buddhism and their subsequent exploration of progressive and radical Buddhist thought in Japan.

* The author criticizes what they perceive as the uncritical liberalism of Critical Buddhism.

* They highlight their interest in exploring Buddhism in conversation with more explicitly political and progressive forms of thought within the Japanese tradition.


## Against Harmony: Progressive and Radical Buddhism in Modern Japan

* This section focuses on the intellectual genealogy and analysis of progressive and radical Buddhism in Japan since the Meiji Restoration (1868).
* It emphasizes the period between 1868 and 1930, during which Japan experienced a rise in nationalism and imperialism.
* The author notes a consensus among "New Buddhist" movements during this time regarding:
    * The need to reform or supplement existing Buddhist institutions with a more vigorous "lay Buddhism."
    * The importance of Buddhism as a "this-worldly" (*genseshugi*) philosophy.
    * The engagement of Buddhism with social, economic, and political issues, particularly those contributing to modern suffering.

* While most New Buddhists remained within the realm of progressive liberalism or social democracy, some were influenced by secular anarchists and Christian socialists, leading to more radical groups like the Youth League for Revitalizing Buddhism (Shinkō Bukkyō Seinen Dōmei).

##  New Buddhism and Materialism

* This section explores the lack of emphasis on metaphysics, cosmology, and doctrine within New Buddhism.
* It attributes this to their commitment to "this-worldliness" and an encounter with pantheist/immanentist and materialist thought traditions, including Marx and Russian anarchists like Bakunin and Kropotkin.

* The author draws parallels between the thought of Epicurus and the Japanese New Buddhists, highlighting their shared emphasis on happiness, freedom from pain, ordinary virtue, and a critique of religious and philosophical transcendence.
* They quote Matthew Stewart's summary of Epicurus's philosophy, emphasizing its focus on happiness through understanding the true nature of things and rejecting harmful fears and superstitions.

##  Epicurean Scepticism and Politics

* This section examines the political implications of Epicurean scepticism, noting that while often considered apolitical, their rejection of "politics" reflects a critique of unreflective and dogmatic forms of belief and practice.
* The author suggests that Epicureans might align with Murray Bookchin's idea of politics originating in local communities rather than large administrative bodies.

## Pragmatism and Transformation

* This section emphasizes the pragmatic nature of philosophy for Epicurus, Lucretius, Pyrrho, and other classical sceptics.
* It highlights their belief that philosophical ideas should be applied in life to achieve a radical transformation of one's outlook on oneself and the world.
* The author draws parallels between this pragmatic approach and the religious impulse, but notes that Pyrrhonian scepticism ultimately aims for "untroubledness" (*ataraxia*) through suspending judgment and accepting the indifference of things.

##  Untroubledness vs. Engagement

* This section contrasts Pyrrhonian "untroubledness" with the more engaged approach of New (and especially radical) Buddhists.
* It suggests that "untroubledness" might be rooted in an acceptance of conventional modes of awareness and understanding, which could be delusory or ideologically constructed.

## Buddhist Phenomenology

*  Phenomena depend on conceptual imputation with social, cognitive, and sensory dimensions. This challenges the "Myth of the Given," arguing that we cannot understand the concept of reality assumed by this myth.
* The dependence is causal, involving an interplay between subjective and objective aspects of reality. 
* Madhyamaka philosophy suggests a phenomenological perspective that sets aside ontology and metaphysics entirely.

## Conclusion

* Bringing Buddhist thought into conversation with Western skepticism and progressive philosophies reveals intriguing possibilities.
* Epicurus, Spinoza, and Marx are better described as proponents of "radical immanence" than materialism, preferring to move away from metaphysics altogether.
*  "Immanentist" thought eschews weak nihilism and sees the lack of ontological ground as a call for greater responsibility. 
* While Pyrrhonian skepticism resembles classical Buddhism, Epicurean skepticism aligns better with progressive contemporary Buddhism.
