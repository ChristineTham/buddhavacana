* Five chapters were contributed by scholars who presented at the conference.
* Two authors wrote new chapters specifically for the book.
* The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation provided financial support for the project.

# Community And Remembrance
* Shared remembrance of the past is crucial for forging and maintaining religious identity.
* Communal remembrances often include stories about founders, seminal events, and other significant aspects of a tradition.
* These remembrances can be expressed through stories, rituals, sacred sites, and monuments.
* Religious groups can be seen as "communities of memory" because shared remembrance is central to their identity.
* The past is always remembered in a partial, distorted, and subjective manner.
* Collective memories are complex assemblages of fact and fiction, myth and history.
* Examining these narratives provides valuable insights into religious beliefs, practices, and cultural contexts.

## Interpretation

* Memories and histories are not straightforward and involve selective and creative processes.
* Collective memory is not fixed and changes over time and across generations.
* The transmission of memories involves ongoing negotiation and interpretation.
* Reading texts always takes place within specific contexts and involves various influences.

## Summary Of Contents

* It covers a chronological range from medieval China to contemporary Taiwan, with a focus on Japan.
* Chapters analyze topics like the Three Levels movement, Meditation Master He, Nanquan Puyuan's story, lineage in Rinzai Zen, and Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan.

## Bibliography

* Lists various academic works relevant to the study of memory, history, and Buddhist studies. 




# Chapter 1 Traces Of The Sanjie (Three Levels) Movement At Baoshan

* This chapter examines the intersections between Baoshan as a place of practice and Sanjie as one of the styles of practice that left its traces at Baoshan.
* It compares liturgical texts from Baoshan and a related Sanjie site, introducing the two monks considered founders of these fields of practice. 
* The chapter discusses Baoshan memorial inscriptions for nuns and monks that show signs of Sanjie affiliation, particularly through the distinctive but contested mortuary ritual of "forest interment" or corpse exposure.

# Backgrounds

* This section provides historical context for the emergence of both Lingyu and Xinxing's soteriological outlook.
* It traces the roots of their beliefs back to the short-lived hybrid Chinese/Xianbei dynasties of the Eastern Wei and Northern Qi. 
* The section details the rise and fall of these dynasties, including periods of Buddhist persecution and patronage.
* It highlights the significance of Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty in establishing Baoshan as a major Buddhist site.
* The section also discusses the Tang dynasty's relationship with Buddhism, including Empress Wu's proscriptions against the Sanjie movement.



## The "Final Age" Context Of The Soteriologies Of Lingyu And Xinxing

* Belief in the advent of the "Final Age of the Dharma" was foundational for both Lingyu and Xinxing.
* This ideology influenced the development of devotional cults, like Pure Land Buddhism.
* Final Age eschatology described the diminishing efficacy of Buddhist teachings over time, followed by the advent of a new Buddha's Dharma.

## Dazhusheng Cave And Lingyu

* The "writing on the wall" at Dazhusheng cave cites the Candragarbha-*sūtra*, warning of the disappearance of pure Dharma.
* Inscriptions inside and outside the cave focus on motivating practice during the difficult Final Age.
* The collection of texts at Dazhusheng may reflect Lingyu's Dilun-based practice and teaching, emphasizing repentance, responsiveness of Buddhas, and the ultimate dharmadhātu. 
* Lingyu wrote a treatise on the destruction of the Dharma (Miefa ji), which is no longer extant.
* Two inscriptions discussed are from the Candragarbha-*sūtra* and the *Chanhui wen*.




## The Candragarbha-Sūtra

* **The Candragarbha-*sūtra***
    * A multi-layered text known for its versions of Śākyamuni's prophecies about the decline of his Dharma.
    * Culminates with a violent saga set in the kingdom of Kauśāmbi, marking the advent of the Final Age.
    * Translated by Narendrayaśas in 566 and became a key source for East Asian *mofa* discourse.

* **Decline Prophecy**
    * Several variations exist within the Candragarbha.
    * Emphasizes supporting monks even if they break precepts.
    * Predicts a gradual decline of Dharma practice over 2,500 years.

* **Support for Errant Monks**
    * Argues that supporting monks who imperfectly keep precepts prevents non-Buddhist teachings from taking over.
    * Sets a good example in bad times.
    * Promises speedy attainment of the first *bhūmi* (ground) of the bodhisattva path to donors.

* **Efficacy of the Robe**
    * The monastic robe is seen as a link to the power of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, even when worn by unworthy individuals.
    * The sanctity of the robe remains despite the decline in the wearers' worthiness.

* **Narrowing Options for Devotees**
    * The Candragarbha depicts a gradual disappearance of various Buddhist practitioners, leaving devotees with only questionable monks.
    * Despite this, supporting these monks is presented as a source of refuge and access to the bodhisattva path.

* **Optimistic Outlook in Difficult Times**
    * Claims that even evil beings will eventually extinguish defilements and protect the Buddha's Dharma.
    * Making offerings to monks who do not keep precepts is seen as equivalent to making offerings to the Buddha himself.
    * A *dhāraṇī* (incantation) is recited to extend the endurance of the True Dharma, accompanied by miraculous signs.

* **Falseness as a Sign**
    * The betrayal of the monastic robe affirms the truth of the Buddha's prophecy.
    * Making offerings to those who do not keep their word demonstrates belief in the Buddha's word and becomes a gateway to transcendence.

## The Confession-Repentance Liturgy

* This section describes a repentance liturgy inscribed at Baoshan, known as the *Chanhui wen*.
* It is based on the *Jueding pini jing*, which outlines early Buddhist confession rituals.
* The inscription begins with homage to various Buddhas and then proceeds with a comprehensive catalogue of offenses that the practitioner may have committed.

## Homage to the Buddhas

* This section lists numerous categories of Buddhas, including those from the ten directions, past Buddhas, fifty-three Buddhas, and thirty-five Buddhas.
* The practitioner pays homage to all these Buddhas.

## Confession and Repentance

* The practitioner confesses their offenses, both in this life and previous lives.
* They pray for the Buddhas to compassionately remember them and help remove karmic residue.
* The confession includes a vow to dedicate merit gained from repentance to the accomplishment of supreme wisdom.


## Buddha Images and Visualization

* Inside the cave, images of Vairocana, Amitābha, and Maitreya are prominently displayed.
* These Buddhas represent key figures in Buddhist soteriology.
* The inscription lists eighty-eight Buddhas (fifty-three and thirty-five) which serve as a liturgical framework for repentance.

## Seven Roster Buddhanāma

* The *Chanhui wen* is classified as an early Chinese version of the Seven Roster *Buddhanāma*, a ritual form based on Indian precedents.
* This form became standard in China and is connected to various devotional liturgies incorporating repentance practice.
* Scholars like Daniel Stevenson and Bruce Williams have studied this genre and its connections to broader soteriological themes.

## Significance of Buddha Names

* The lists of Buddha names serve specific functions within the ritual.
* Buddhas of the ten directions provide a basis for spatial visualization.
* Seven Buddhas of the past prompt reflection on cycles of Dharma decline and regeneration.
* Fifty-three Buddhas symbolize purification, while thirty-five Buddhas act as witnesses to confession.

# Repentance And Sanjie Practice

* The Sanjie movement was active into the ninth century despite imperial proscriptions.
* Xinxing, a possible student of Daoping and thus Lingyu's fellow disciple, emphasized repentance rituals for beings with karmic burdens.
* He used Final Age periodization from the Candragarbha-*sūtra* and advocated offerings to erring monks.

# Three Levels

* Sanjie refers to three spiritual capacities: superior, middling, and debased.
* Xinxing claimed humans in the current age were at the lowest level, unable to benefit from varied teachings (*biefa*) and needing universal teachings (*pufa*) of nonduality.
* Effective practice involved acknowledging one's evil (*ren'e*) and universal reverence (*pujing*) for others' incipient Buddhahood.

# Inexhaustible Treasury

* The "inexhaustible treasury" (*wujinzang*) concept, drawing on the *Avataṃsaka*'s inexhaustible merit treasury, was central to Sanjie.
* Xinxing preached that access to this merit field was achieved through non-discriminatory giving.
* Daoxuan's biography of Xinxing highlights his ascetic lifestyle and circumambulation of Buddha-image stupas.

# Xinxing's Teachings

* Xinxing abandoned the precepts but lived ascetically, adhering to six daily worship periods and begging for food.
* He emphasized donations to corrupt monks first as a sign of universal offering.
* He cited the *Candragarbha* to support this claim, though it doesn't explicitly prioritize precept breakers.

# Sanjie and Jingtu

* Both Sanjie and Jingtu arose from anxiety about practice efficacy in the Final Age.
* They emphasized repentant self-reflection attracting Buddha attention and acknowledging world and personal corruption.
* Sanjie promoted donation of "some small thing" communally dedicated to the *wujinzang*.

# Jinchuanwan Cave

* This cave site, likely from the 660s, shows Sanjie elements echoing Dazhusheng's foundational Buddha-name liturgy.
* The main image is Śākyamuni, recreated in 2002.
* East wall engravings include texts by Xinxing, the *Candragarbha-*sūtra*, and the *Shilun jing*.

# West Wall Engravings

* West wall engravings feature the *Qijie foming jing*, *Diamond Sūtra*, *T*ianpin miaofa lianhua jing*, and Rulai shijiao shengjunwang jing.
* Xinxing's *Qijie foming jing* emphasizes repentance and Buddha evocation (*Buddhanama*), echoing Dazhusheng's *Chanhui wen*.

# Invocation Practices at Dazhusheng and Jinchuanwan Caves

* The text describes invocation practices found at the Dazhusheng and Jinchuanwan caves, both associated with Sanjie Buddhism.
* At Dazhusheng, the invocations primarily focus on Buddha-names from various sutras like the *Guan Yaowang Yaoshang er pusa jing* and the *Jueding pini jing*.

# Liturgical Complement to the Qijie Foming Jing

* Xinxing, a prominent Sanjie figure, created the *Zhouye liushi fayuan fa*, a liturgical text that complements the *Qijie foming jing*.
* This text specifies a structured regimen of worship for each of the six daily periods, involving offerings, homage, and recitation of Buddha-names.

# Comparing Dazhusheng and Jinchuanwan Caves

* The Dazhusheng cave, associated with Lingyu, reflects Sanjie identity more subtly through its design and textual references.
* In contrast, the Jinchuanwan cave, linked to Xinxing, explicitly showcases his teachings and writings, highlighting a more overt expression of Sanjie identity.

# Sanjie Identity and Community Practices

* The text highlights how Sanjie Buddhism sought to establish distinct spaces for its practitioners.
* This is evident in their attempt to create exclusive cloisters for Sanjie clergy, which were ultimately banned in 725.

## Proscriptions Against Sanjie

* The Sanjie texts and practices were banned by imperial edicts five times: in 600, 694, 699, 721, and 725.
* Arguments suggest the bans were due to the doctrine of Universal Dharma challenging imperial authority.
* Hubbard argues for particularity and complexity in each case of suppression.

## The Sui Dynasty Ban (600)

* A memorial was issued six years after Xinxing's death prohibiting Sanjie propagation.
*  Hubbard suggests Gao Jiong, a Sanjie patron, angered Empress Wenxian by opposing her plans, leading to the ban.

## Empress Wu and the Sanjie (694-699)

* Empress Wu issued edicts delegitimizing Sanjie texts and curbing practices.
* She attempted to control Sanjie resources but also supported it in some respects.

## Baoshan and Corpse Exposure

* Some inscriptions at Baoshan reference corpse exposure, a practice associated with Sanjie asceticism.
* The most common designation on memorial niches is *huishen ta*, indicating a broader interest in enshrining post-cremation relics.

## Relics and Repentance

* There was avid interest in relics during the 5th and 6th centuries.
* Tanqian promoted court-sponsored relic worship, connecting with the *dharmakāya*.
* Relic veneration served political purposes, repentance practice, and mortuary practices.


## Forest Interment (*Linzang*)

*  Baoshan inscriptions attest to extreme purification practices, including forest interment.
* Liu Shufen's studies suggest these practices were more widespread than recognized.
* Corpse exposure was associated with ascetic practitioners and extreme generosity.

# Forest Interment at Baoshan

* There is explicit reference to forest interment among the memorials at Baoshan, along with four other descriptions pointing to it.
* Scholars have noted and expanded on the links between Baoshan and Sanjie practices and references.
* Liu argues that Sanjie-inspired *linzang* was widely practiced at Baoshan, making it comparable to Zhongnanshan.

# Identifying Markers for Linzang

* Liu considers terms like *suishen ta*, *sanshen ta*, *zhiti ta*, and *huishen ta* as identifying markers for *linzang*.
* However, only one reference exists for *suishen ta* and one for *sanshen ta*.
* *Zhiti* is a transliteration of *caitya*, not in itself an indication of *linzang*.

#  Fifty-Five Niches Identified as Huishen Ta

* Fifty-five niches identified as *huishen ta* at Baoshan cannot be reliably linked with either *linzang* or Sanjie practice.
* Liu assumes that a gap between death date and the dedication of the stūpa niche indicates an intervening period of corpse exposure, but this may not always be true.

# Perception of Sanjie Followers in Mid-Seventh Century

* It is unclear how Sanjie followers were generally perceived by mainstream clerics in the mid-seventh century.
* Greene argues that Daoxuan may have intended to target Sanjie followers in his *Xu gaoseng zhuan*.
* However, these characteristics would not help us identify Sanjie practice at Baoshan.

# Lingchen's Memorial and Sanjie Affiliation

* The most dramatic link connecting Baoshan, Sanjie, and corpse exposure is the mortuary inscription for Xinxing's disciple, Dhyāna Master Lingchen.
* Lingchen's memorial explicitly mentions his Sanjie affiliation and describes post-mortem exposure.
* The description of the stūpa-niche site sounds more like Xiaonanhai than Baoshan.

# Interpreting Signs of Death

* The inscription for Lingchen mentions an auspicious sign at death, which was a topic of considerable interest.
* Kuiji's commentary on the Cheng weishi lun discusses interpreting signs of death to divine future conditions.





# and she suggests that it not only served as Sengchou's meditation cave but also as a resting place where his corpse was exposed for a year, prior to the cremation of his bones. 

* Kim argues that this type of cave interment for monks became common in the North in the late sixth century.
* She links this with the *Xu gaoseng zhuan* story of a monk who added the portrait of another monk to the walls of the stone meditation chamber where the latter had died and desiccated.

# Baoshan Inscriptions Describing Corpse Exposure

* Baoshan's earliest datable stūpa-shaped niches are from the late sixth century and contain small statues, which appear to be the first extant Chinese Buddhist reliquaries to include statues representing the deceased.
* Most of the remaining mortuary images sit within medium-relief niches ranging in height from fifty to two hundred centimeters, carved in the limestone outcroppings of Baoshan and Lanfengshan. 

#  

* The enshrined mortuary images are functionally and iconographically distinct from donor images of clerics and laypersons on stelae, or on murals and carvings at cave temples.
* Donors were usually represented standing or kneeling in three-quarters view oriented toward a central image, and they were often arranged in family groups. In contrast, the Baoshan and Lanfengshan mortuary images are seated or kneeling, face the viewer, and are singular.

#  

* Most of the inscriptions are brief, recording the name, title, and temple of the deceased, the date of the dedication of the niche, and often the names of the donor-disciples who created the memorial.
* The most formal and lengthy type of memorial followed the conventions of the genre of ancestral muzhi ming 暮誌銘 (entombed epitaphs), which were adapted for Buddhist use.

#  

* Fortunately, corroboration that likeness was desired is found in five of the inscriptions.
* These phrases indicate that the disciples who commissioned and dedicated these niches intended to create likenesses of the deceased.

# 


* There is also a slightly different group of five Baoshan inscriptions (LFS 42, 45, 47, 25, and 26) that describe corpse exposure.


## Lfs 42. Dhyāna Master Jinggan 靜感 (561–646), Nun

* **Early Life and Lineage:**
    * Born in Dunhuang, from a family with Northern Wei gentry origins.
    * Showed signs of spiritual inclination from a young age.

* **Spiritual Practice and Accomplishments:**
    * Studied Buddhist scriptures diligently.
    * Mastered the Vinayas (monastic codes) and engaged in deep meditation.
    * Achieved a state of profound stillness, described as "form like a withered tree, mind as if dead ashes."
    * Possessed healing abilities and inspired others through her presence.

* **Later Life and Death:**

    * Traveled extensively, carrying a staff and engaging in ascetic practices.
    * Died at Shengdao temple at the age of eighty-six.
    * Her disciples gathered her relics and built a stūpa to commemorate her.

## Lfs 26. Dharma Master Huixiu 慧休 (547–646), Monk

* **Life and Teachings:**
    * A respected Dharma Master known for his wisdom and teaching abilities.
    * Attracted students who sought his guidance on Buddhist teachings.
    * Emphasized the importance of deep study and meditation.

* **Death and Commemoration:**
    * Died in 647 at Cirun monastery.
    * His disciples built a stūpa to honor him, inscribing it with an ode praising his virtues.
    * The inscription highlights his profound understanding of Buddhist teachings and the impact he had on his students.

## Inscription On Outer Rock Face To Northeast Of Niche:

* The inscription commemorates the late great Treatise Master of Cirun monastery, Dharma Master Huixiu.
* It details his lineage, scholarly achievements, and monastic life.
* Huixiu was known for his profound understanding of Buddhist scriptures, particularly those related to the Dilun and Shelun exegetical trends.
* He authored numerous commentaries on important Buddhist texts, including the *Daśabhūmika-*sūtra*, *Bodhisattvabhūmi*, and *Mahāyānasaṃgraha-*śāstra*.
* Huixiu was also renowned for his compassion and diligence in caring for his monastic community.

##  The Passing of a Soteriological Episteme:


* The inscription reflects a shift in soteriological understanding from reliance on the Buddha's presence to the transmission of Dharma through enlightened masters like Huixiu.
* While acknowledging the "setting" of the Buddha-sun, the text emphasizes the continued illumination provided by those who carry on the torch of wisdom.
* This suggests a transition towards a more localized and lineage-based understanding of Buddhist salvation.

# Dazhusheng cave

*  Dazhusheng enshrines Vairocana as its main image.
* Several passages and images emphasize the dimming of Śākyamuni's Dharma.
* The necropolis around Dazhusheng created a communal memory of the passing of the lamp, leading to its nickname "Valley of Ten Thousand Buddhas."

# Conclusions

* Practitioners at Baoshan engaged in a variety of intersecting fields of practice.
* Evidence of Sanjie practice exists, but no mention of Xinxing or Sanjie as sectarian identities.
*  "Dilun" practice is not explicitly mentioned, though its influence is evident.
* Links between Sanjie's negative reputation and Baoshan are tenuous.
* Baoshan assimilated extreme Sanjie practices into its community of memory.

#  Baoshan's Stylized Mortuary Niches

* Niches appear uniform with repetitive motifs and formulaic inscription language.
* However, the range of texts and practices presented reveals individualized niches.
* Individualism emerges through unique combinations of available practices and interpretations of the Dharma.
* Baoshan's Sanjie connections contribute to its distinctive identity without being tied to any specific cult or movement.

# The Ambiguity Surrounding Sanjie Practice at Baoshan

* Memorial inscriptions affirm dedicated practice through allusions to signature Sanjie practices, descriptions of image-making for relics, mentions of corpse exposure, and references to "supernal appearance."
* These elements often appear together in memorials, illustrating the complexity of the exemplary practitioner's body within Baoshan's community of memory.

# Chapter 2

* Meditation Master He 和禪師 has been misidentified as a disciple of Huike 惠可 due to his name appearing in Huike's biography.
* Evidence suggests he was likely an acquaintance or contemporary of Huike, not a disciple.
* This chapter examines sources concerning Meditation Master He and argues he was a monk active in the Jinling 金陵 area.

# Problematizing The Identity Of Meditation Master He

* Daoxuan 道宣 mentions three obscure monks (Hua 化, Yan 彥, and He 和) at the end of Huike's biography.
* Most scholars have accepted these monks as Huike's disciples, but Daoxuan doesn't explicitly state this relationship.
* The structure of Huike's biography suggests that Daoxuan did not consider these three monks to be his disciples.

# Four More Monks Named He

* Daoxuan mentions at least three other monks named He in the *Xu gaoseng zhuan*.
* This section examines information about these different monks named He.

# Meditation Master He As A Mentor Of Meditation Master Xuanjing

* Daoxuan's biography of Xuanjing 玄景 identifies a Meditation Master He as his teacher.
* This Meditation Master He was based in Yexia 鄴下 and known for his expertise in meditation.
* He taught Mahāyāna texts like the Mahāprajñāpramitā sūtra and the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa sūtra.

## Meditation Master He As A Mentor For The Buddhist Defender Jing'Ai

* Jing'ai became a Buddhist novice at age seventeen under Meditation Master He.
* Jing'ai received full ordination and upheld the precepts and monastic codes.
* Jing'ai studied the *Da zhidu lun* under Dharma Master Jing, who was likely a disciple of Meditation Master He.
* Jing'ai focused on four scriptures: *Da zhidu lun*, *Zhonglun*, *Bailun*, and *Shiermen lun*.

## Ācārya He As The Mentor Of The Buddhist Thaumaturge Huikan

* Huikan became a Buddhist novice under Ācārya He at a young age.
* Ācārya He possessed supernatural abilities and was deeply respectful towards Buddha images.
* He was compassionate, rescuing suffering beings like pigs tied up by their owner.
* Ācārya He skillfully explained Buddhist teachings using worldly analogies, enlightening his listeners.
* He moved to Yexia, where he successfully preached Buddhism and gained many followers.



## Ācārya He As A Buddhist Exegete

* Several monk-scholars during the Sui and Tang dynasties mentioned an individual named Ācārya He in their works.
* They cited him as an exegetical authority on various Buddhist scriptures, including the *Mohe bore boluomi jing*, *Daban niepan jing*, and the *Lotus Sūtra*.

* Jizang quotes from Ācārya He's commentary on a prajñā text, criticizing his radical interpretation of bodhisattvahood.
* Guanding refers to Ācārya He in his commentary on the *Daban niepan jing*, defining the term *shoulengyan*.
* Daoxian also quotes from Ācārya He's work on the *Daban niepan jing*, focusing on the definition of *shoulengyan*.

* Jizang uses another quote from Ācārya He in his commentary on the *Lotus Sūtra*, identifying him as a scholar from Guangzhai temple.
* The fact that Ācārya He was cited by prominent monks like Jizang and Guanding suggests his significance as a Buddhist scholar.

## Another He: Ācārya Huihe, A Disciple Of Mahāsattva Fu

*  Another monk named Ācārya He, whose full Dharma name is Huihe (502–61), is mentioned in an epitaph included in the *Shanhui dashi yulu*.
* This text contains teachings attributed to Mahāsattva Fu, a self-proclaimed reincarnation of Maitreya.

* Huihe's epitaph was written by Zhou Hongzheng at the order of Emperor Xuan of the Chen dynasty.


## Family Background And Precocity

* Huihe came from a distinguished family with ancestral origins in Maoling, Fufeng.
* As a child, he reportedly saw a golden figure who accompanied him on his travels.
* His precociousness was noticed by prominent monks like Baozhi and Dharma Master Yun.
* He studied extensively under Dharma Master Yun, quickly mastering Buddhist teachings and surpassing his teacher's expectations.

## Discipleship Under Dharma Master Yin

* Dharma Master Yin instructed Huihe to chant the names of the *samādhi* called Shoulengyan fa loudly at empty mountains, open spaces, cities, and villages.
* He believed this practice would bring deep benefits and enable Huihe to perfect a variety of practices.
* Unlike other masters, Yin's identity remains a mystery.

## Association With Ācārya Yan And Study Under Mahāsattva Fu

* Huihe briefly stayed with Ācārya Yan, who initially hesitated due to his self-perception as an idle person.
* This anecdote highlights Huihe's growing reputation among contemporaries.
* Another story recounts how Marquis Shangshen scoffed at the idea of Huihe visiting Mahāsattva Fu, only to be humbled by Huihe's arrival and devotion to Mahāsattva Fu.

## Move To And Death In Yexia

* Huihe was invited to Northern Qi by Gao Yang in 546.
* He lived there for several months before passing away at Dingguo temple in the Ye capital in 561.
* The exact year of his death is debated, with some sources suggesting 569.




## Huihe'S Dying Wish And His Works

* Huihe expressed a compassionate wish for his body to be left in a field or river after death, serving as nourishment for animals and ultimately benefiting all sentient beings.
* He believed this practice would transform his remains into precious offerings that would bring rain and sustenance to the world.

## Association With Dharma Master Su

* A dream experienced by Dharma Master Su at Shichengsi temple suggested a karmic connection between him and Huihe, solidified through an incense offering.
* Dharma Master Su was likely an expert on the *Lotus* sūtra, potentially associated with the renowned *Lotus* preacher Zhengze of the Liang dynasty.

## Self-Effacement And Frugality

* Huihe exhibited exceptional humility by reciprocating bows and refusing to accept veneration without offering it back.
* He donated all offerings received for lectures or precepts to the Buddha and the Saṃgha, demonstrating his selflessness.
* His frugality was evident in his simple lifestyle, choosing raw linen over blankets and rejecting the creation of his image for worship.

## Summary

* Huihe's life was marked by intellectual pursuits, spiritual guidance from prominent figures like Baozhi and Fayun, and close associations with peers like Ācārya Yan and Dharma Master Su.
* He made a significant decision to move north during the decline of the Liang dynasty, continuing his work as a Buddhist leader in Yexia.
* His personality was characterized by compassion, reverence for all beings, simplicity, frugality, and self-effacement.
* Huihe's major works included commentaries on texts like the *Da niepan jing*, *Shoulengyan jing*, *Lotus* Sūtra, and possibly the *Da zhidu lun*.

## Reconstructing The Life Of Meditation Master Huihe

* Six Buddhist monks known as Meditation Master He or Ācārya He are mentioned in various texts. This section aims to determine if they were the same person.

* Strong evidence suggests that Huihe was Huikan's teacher, Ācārya He. Both shared experiences in Jinling and Yexia, enthusiasm for the *śūraṃgamasamādhi*, and a peculiar preference for not sitting before statues of standing Buddhas.
* Comparisons between Huihe's lectures and commentaries with texts linked to Ācārya He suggest they are the same person.

* Ācārya He's association with Guangzhai temple aligns with Huihe's monastic background.

* The presence of Ācārya Yan in Huihe's epitaph connects him to Meditation Master He mentioned in Huike's biography, where he is also associated with Master Yan and Master Hua.
* Connections between Meditation Master He as Xuanjing's teacher and another Meditation Master He acting as Jing'ai's teacher suggest they are the same person.

* Based on geographical proximity and other evidence, it is likely that these two Hes were one monk.

* Huihe's journey from the South to Yexia aligns with the image of Meditation Master He described in Xuanjing and Jing'ai's biographies.
* Huihe likely left the South before 550, when Jing'ai began studying under him at Baiguan temple. This timeline is consistent with other findings regarding Huihe's departure for the North in 546.

* Huihe's possible ties to the Madhyamika meditation tradition at Qixia temple further support his identification as Xuanjing and Jing'ai's teacher, Meditation Master He.
* Huikan, Huihe's disciple, spent time at Qixia temple and may have been a colleague of Huibu there.

*  Jing'ai's enthusiasm for the four Mādhyamika *śāstra*s aligns with Huihe's teachings and practices.

* Both Huihe and Jing'ai were connected to Mahāsattva Fu, known for his involvement in self-immolation practices. This shared connection strengthens the possibility that Meditation Master He was indeed Huihe.





# Xuanjing's Biography and Water Burial

* Xuanjing wished for an image of Maitreya in his dream before death, possibly signifying rebirth.
* His request to be buried at sea is a rare example in medieval China.
* This practice parallels Huihe's preference for forest burial, which was rejected by his disciples.

# Meditation Master He'S Followers

* Focuses on Jing'ai, a prominent disciple of Meditation Master He known for self-immolation and training talented disciples.
* Jing'ai studied Daoist texts and practices before becoming a disciple of an unnamed Indian monk.
* Respected by contemporaries like Daoan and Tanyan, he attempted to intervene against the suppression of Buddhism but ultimately committed suicide in protest.

# Jing'ai's Disciples

*  Highlights notable disciples: Puan, Sengzhao, Zhizang, and Daopan.
* Puan studied with Puyuan before becoming Jing'ai's disciple and served as a mentor to the crown prince.
* Sengzhao was a renowned meditation master who rejected imperial summons.
* Zhizang retired to Mount Zhongnan, built Fengdesi temple, and served on the prestigious shidade committee.
* Daopan, possibly Jing'ai's successor, was a Buddhist pilgrim who attempted journeys to India and resided at various temples before retiring to Mount Zhongnan.

## Concluding Remarks

* Meditation Master He, mentioned in Huike's biography by Daoxuan, was likely Huihe, a popular monk active in Yexia at the same time as Huike.
* Huihe was known for his compassion, devotion, meditational skill, and preaching abilities. 
* He taught Mahāyāna texts like *Mohe bore boluomi jing*, *Weimo jing, Shoulengyan jing,* and *Lotus Sūtra*.

##  The Religious Background of Huihe and His Disciples

* Huihe's group was involved in several important Buddhist traditions in both southern and northern China.
* He likely learned from Mahāsattva Fu, a charismatic leader who promoted a Maitreya cult and unique meditation practices.
* Other influences include the *Lotus* commentarial tradition, śū*raṃgamasamādhi* principles, and Madhyamika-type meditation.

## Huihe's Impact and Legacy

* Huihe spread southern Buddhist traditions to northern China during his time in Yexia.
* His teachings likely influenced Jing'ai's enthusiasm for Madhyamika treatises and self-immolation.
* Huihe's impact extended beyond Jing'ai, influencing a generation of monks.

## The Importance of Examining Multiple Sources

* Daoxuan acknowledged the lack of epigraphic and textual sources about Meditation Master He and other contemporaries. 
* Despite mentioning four monks named He, Daoxuan may not have realized that at least two were the same person (Huihe).
* This suggests Daoxuan did not have access to Huihe's epitaph, which provides valuable information about his life.

## The Limitations of Daoxuan's *Xu gaoseng zhuan*

* While generally reliable, Daoxuan's collection has limitations due to missing primary sources.
* This case highlights the need for critical engagement with Daoxuan's work and exploration of other sources.

## The Impact of Sectarian Historiography

* Chan sectarian texts often present a different narrative than Daoxuan's *Xu gaoseng zhuan*.
* The identification of Meditation Master He as Huike's disciple is an example of how sectarian historiography can obscure the truth.

* The earliest full version appears in *Jingde chuan deng lu* (compiled in 1004), about 170 years after Nanquan's death.

* There are two versions: one from *Jingde chuan deng lu* and a shorter one from *Zu tang ji*.
* Both involve monks arguing, Nanquan threatening to kill the cat unless someone says something profound, and then killing it when no one responds.
* In the *Jingde chuan deng lu* version, Zhaozhou arrives later and reacts by taking off his shoes and putting them on his head.

## Issues And Incongruities

* The story raises ethical questions about Nanquan's behavior, which violates Buddhist precepts against killing.
* It highlights issues with radical teaching methods used by Hongzhou monks, including physical acts like beating and shouting.
* There are questions about the story's historical accuracy and whether it reflects actual events or is a fictional narrative.
* The story seems to reject conventional morality and traditional Buddhist paths to awakening.
* Incongruous elements include monks keeping cats in the Sangha hall and Nanquan carrying a large knife.

* The story likely doesn't reflect the lives of the historical figures involved, but rather represents a later literary creation.

## Unexplored Possibilities

* The story of Nanquan killing a cat may not be a profound truth but rather a problematic narrative with questionable provenance.
* Traditional interpretations often overlook the possibility that the story is simply bad, lacking deep meaning despite attempts to infuse it with higher purpose.
* This story, and others like it, deflect attention from the actual ideas, teachings, and practices of Tang Chan Buddhism.

## The Encounter Dialogue Model

* This narrative model features dialogues between Chan masters and disciples, often depicting the master's wisdom and virtuosity through unconventional pedagogical techniques.
* While popular in Chan lore, this format only appeared in the mid-tenth century and is filled with clichés and formulaic repetitions.
* Despite its iconoclastic ethos, the encounter dialogue model reflects a conservative tradition seeking to promote Buddhist orthodoxy during the Tang-Song transition.

## Exegesis In The Main Gong'An Collections

* Nanquan and Zhaozhou appear frequently in influential *gong'an* collections like *Wumen guan*, *Bi yan lu*, and *Cong rong lu*.
* These collections present elaborate exegeses of the story, emphasizing its profound meaning and pointing towards a realm of awakening beyond words and ideas.
* Commentators often use evocative language and ostentatious oratory to highlight the sublime nature of Nanquan's actions, suggesting that true understanding precedes all discussions and commentaries.




## Wumen'S Commentary

* Wumen's commentary on the Nanquan story is brief and vague.
* He focuses on Zhaozhou's actions, particularly putting sandals on his head.
* Wumen suggests that Nanquan's act of killing the cat was not pointless because it led to Zhaozhou's enlightened response.

## Normative Assumptions And Unquestioned Orthodoxies

* Yuanwu assumes Nanquan is an enlightened master whose every action has profound meaning.
* Commentators like Qu Ruji reinforce this view, highlighting Nanquan's "complete potency and great function."
* This assumption shapes the interpretation of the story and limits alternative readings.
* Yuanwu uses convoluted language to establish his authority as a Chan master and impress elite audiences.

* The story is seen as depicting enlightened acts by perfected beings, reinforcing traditional beliefs and power structures within Chan Buddhism.
* Yuanwu's commentary allows for poetic license because Nanquan is assumed to be infallible.
* Yuanwu glosses over the act of killing the cat and focuses on broader themes of self-actualization and true knowledge.

* Other commentators like Xuedou and Xingxiu also downplay the significance of the cat's death, blaming the monks for their lack of understanding.
* The story may primarily serve to highlight the wisdom of Nanquan and Zhaozhou, as well as the literary skill of later commentators.
* The use of violence raises ethical questions and the possibility of Chan antinomianism.

# On the Surface, Yuanwu's Exegesis Does Not Seem to Be Concerned or Constrained by the Concrete Elucidations or Events Described in the Story

* It does not concern itself with the ethical issues raised by it.
* He declines to turn the story into a morality play of any sort.
* He indicates that it has little to do with morality. 

# When Looking at This Kind of Exegesis, We Are Essentially Dealing With Normative Articles of Faith

* Grounded in an established tradition and shaped by rigid literary conventions.
* The meaningfulness and sanctity of the acts depicted in the story is not really something that is open for serious debate or discussion. 

#  The Story Points to Important Facets of Chan Buddhism, as It Developed from the Song Era Onward

* It also raises a number of thought-provoking questions.
* How and why this and other stories became canonized as prime examples of inscrutable Chan wisdom?
* Why was there a lack of challenge, from within the tradition, to their established status as linchpins of Chan orthodoxy and focal elements of Chan lore?

# While the Classical *Gong'an* Collections From the Song Era Contain the Best-Known and Most Influential Exegetical Treatments of the Story About Nanquan Killing a Cat

* The story is also commented on or cited in many other Chan/Zen texts from the Song and later eras, in China as well as in other parts of East Asia.
* For the most part, these sources do not stray much beyond the exegetical paradigms and ideological suppositions examined above.

# To Illustrate These Trends, Below I Briefly Introduce Several Representative Examples of This Sort of Exegesis

* It is possible to find many other similar examples of traditionalist comments, allusions, or explanations of the Nanquan story, scattered in a number of Chan texts.
* Pertinent examples include: 
    * Zong jian fa lin* 宗鑑法林, citing Zhongfeng Mingben 中峰明本 (1263–1323);
    * Wanfeng heshang yulu* 萬峰和尚語錄, citing Wanfeng Shiwei 萬峰時蔚 (1303–1381);
    * Baiyu chanshi yulu* 百愚禪師語錄, citing Baiyu Chanshi 百愚禪師 (1610–1665);
    * Dahui pujue chanshi yulu* 大慧普覺禪師語錄, citing Dahui Zonggao 大慧宗杲 (1089–1163);
    * Wu deng huiyuan* 五燈會元, citing Jueyin 覺印 (d. 1018) and Weishang 惟尚 (1074–1140);
    * Wu deng quan shu* 五燈全書, citing Qingyu 清欲 (1292–1367).

# A Common Exegetical Strategy Is to Read the Nanquan Story in Symbolic Terms

* For instance, one could postulate that Nanquan was not really slicing the flesh of a living creature, but was cutting off the delusions and attachments of his monks (and all other beings), which are grounded in dualistic thought and fundamental misapprehension of reality.
* According to the doctrine of emptiness, all phenomena are like dreams and illusions. Since there is no self or other, there is nobody to do the killing or be killed.

# In That Sense, Nanquan's Gesture of Holding a Knife Can Be Likened to Mañjuśri (Wenshu 文殊), the Celestial Bodhisattva Who Embodies the Perfection of Wisdom

* Wielding the sword of wisdom that cuts off the ignorance and delusion of all beings.
* This kind of approach, which makes use of well known Buddhist concepts, themes, and symbols, is common in Chinese commentarial literature.

# Parenthetically, One of the Problems With This Kind of Nonliteral and Over-Interpretative Reading of the Nanquan Story Is That It Fails to Deploy the Concept of Emptiness in Conjunction With the Related Doctrine of Two Truths (Relative and Absolute)

* This sort of interpretative strategy is sometimes adopted in order to skirt attention away from (or gloss over) some of the problematic ethical ramifications arising from stories that depict morally questionable acts.

# A Pertinent Example of This Sort of Interpretation Can Be Found in the Record of Linquan Laoren 林泉老人 (1223–1281), Also Known as Linquan Conglun 林泉從倫

* Who lived during the late Southern Song and early Yuan eras.
* Linquan, a leading disciple of Wansong who is associated with the Caodong school 曹洞宗, is primarily known as the compiler of *Xu tang ji* 虛 堂集 (Empty Hall Anthology, complied in 1295) and *Kong gu ji* 空谷集 (Empty Valley Anthology, preface dated 1285).

# Linquan's Treatment of the Nanquan Story Reads in Part as Follows:

* This is like not missing an opportunity to help when one encounters someone in trouble. Thus, (Nanquan) did what was appropriate in that situation. Wiping out false thoughts and getting rid of extreme emotions, (Nanquan) taught (the disciples) about the original (state of mind, which is like) when Mighty Sound (Buddha) appeared before the beginning of the empty eon.
* In an instant, one eliminates the attachment to self; in regard to the emptiness of all phenomena, in an instant one puts an end to all causal conditions.

# Linquan Goes on to Relate the Well-Known Story About Mañjuśri Wielding a Sword as He Moves Aggressively Towards the Buddha

* Which appears in the Da bao ji jing 大寶積經 (Collection of Great Treasures Scripture).
* Once upon a time, the story goes, five hundred monks attained the supernatural power of being able to see their past lives. Consequently, they were able to perceive the numerous crimes and unwholesome actions they have committed in their past lives, including the killing of their parents.

# The Monks Found That Very Disturbing, and Started to Doubt Their Capacity to Attain Awakening

* Inspired by the supernatural power of the Buddha, Mañjuśri tried to help them. He took out his sword and came forward towards the Buddha, in a gesture indicative of an intention to kill the Enlightened One.
* The monks were initially shocked by the dramatic gesture, but then they had a profound realization: they apprehended that everything is empty, being like a dream or an illusion.

# Here Is the End of Linquan's Retelling of the Canonical Story:

* As is the sword, so is the Buddha: they are equally (of the nature of reality), without any duality. Since everything is without any attributes and is unborn, how can there be any killing?
* Having thus established canonical justification for this line of interpretation, Linquan goes on to equate Nanquan's act of killing the cat with Mañjuśri's theatrical gesture towards the Buddha, as can be seen in the next quotation.

# As a Result, Nanquan Is Free From Any Wrongdoing, and His Action Does Not Carry Any Moral Connotations


* Perhaps needless to say, this kind of interpretation raises serious ethical issues. Among other things, it can serve as a pretext for various sorts of abuses or questionable behaviors, as has often happened in the history of Buddhism, in China and elsewhere.

# At the End of the Passage, We Have a Clear Attempt to Insulate Nanquan—or Rather the Anonymous Writer of the Story—From Any Kind of Meaningful Critique


* We are told that nobody can censure or criticize Nanquan for his violent action—or anything he does, for that matter. To do so would be tantamount to an unwarranted slander.
* A person daring to articulate any sort of meaningful criticism can simply be dismissed as being an unenlightened ignoramus whose mind is filled with shallow views and one-sided attachments.

# So Much for Intellectual Freedom and the Need to Question Established Authority


* This kind of argument, often accompanied with the charge that the critic lacks genuine Chan experience and insight—which presumably are possessed by the Chan master commenting on the *gong'an*—is often deployed in Chan/Zen circles to deflect potential critiques, disapproval, or challenges to authority, all the way down to the present.

# For Instance, Zibo Zhenke 紫柏真可 (1543–1603), an Influential Chan Master From the Late Ming Era, Argues That Having Doubts About This and Other Similar Stories That Feature Violent Acts Is Indicative of a Lack of Genuine Understanding of Chan


* That can apparently happen even to a bodhisattva who has reached the tenth (and highest) stage of the bodhisattva path, let alone to ordinary readers of these stories.
* That, by extension, confirms the sectarian notion that Chan is vastly superior to canonical Buddhism.

# In an Interesting Twist, at Times Nanquan's *Gong'an* Also Becomes an Integral Part of Short Vignettes or Exchanges Composed in the Encounter Dialogue Format


* Which appear in a variety of texts composed from the Song era onward. Below I give three examples, from Zhi yue lu, *Tiansheng guang* deng lu (compiled in 1029), and *Miyun chanshi yulu* 密雲禪師語錄
(Recorded Sayings of Chan Master Miyun).

# What is the meaning of (the story about) Nanquan killing a cat?

* Deshan hit Xuefeng with his stick and chased him away when Xuefeng asked this question.
* Deshan then summoned Xuefeng back and asked if he understood, but Xuefeng said no.
* Deshan compared his heart to that of an old woman, implying a deep sense of compassion or weariness.

# Xinglin ascended the hall to preach

* Xinglin grabbed a cat that jumped on him and showed it to the monks.
* He referenced Nanquan killing a cat and Guizong killing a snake as examples for Chan practitioners.
* Xinglin then threw down the cat and returned to his quarters.

# A monk once asked Miyun about the morality of killing in relation to the Nanquan story

* The monk questioned why Nanquan killed a cat and Guizong killed a snake, given that killing is a grave breach of monastic precepts.
* Miyun told the monk to repent for asking such a question.

# Modern Examples

* The story about Nanquan killing a cat remains popular in modern publications on Chan/Zen.
* Interpretations often stay within traditionalist strictures, portraying Nanquan as an enlightened master and his act as pointing to some inscrutable truth.
* Some modern writers express unease or ambivalence regarding the moral tenor of the story.

# Shibayama Zenkei's commentary on the Nanquan *gong'an*

* Shibayama criticizes scholars who interpret the story solely from an ethical perspective, arguing that they lack "the authentic Zen eye and experience."
* He reiterates the theme that *kōan* are direct expressions of a deep Zen experience, beyond the realm of ethical concerns.
* Shibayama claims Nanquan performed the act with a "bleeding heart" and "tears in his eyes," implying he had no choice but to kill the cat.

# Comparative Frameworks

* The "sacred" canons of major religions are complex and multilayered, often containing diverse narratives and textual styles.
* Dealing with potentially controversial or problematic scriptural materials is a challenge for religious communities.
* Interpretation strategies like allegory and contextual analysis help reconcile challenging passages with established beliefs.
* Examples include interpreting the Song of Songs in Judaism and Christianity, and addressing morally complex stories in the Hebrew Bible.

# Concluding Remarks

* Analyzing the Nanquan story and its commentaries reveals aspects of Chan/Zen tradition's understanding of its past and interpretation of its canon.
* The chapter challenges conventional narratives about Chan literature, doctrine, and practice during the Song era and beyond.
* It suggests a lack of critical thinking and intellectual rigor in later Chan/Zen traditions, possibly due to an unwillingness to challenge established dogmas.
* The author proposes that some Chan/Zen stories might be "religious gibberish" or evidence of a tradition running out of compelling ideas.
* Encouraging critical reexamination of received narratives and challenging entrenched creeds can contribute to a deeper understanding of East Asian Buddhism and the place of Chan/Zen within it.

## Chapter 4

* **Focus:** Discusses the concept of lineage in Chan/Zen Buddhism and its role in shaping identity.

* **Key Points:**
    * Lineage is central to Chan/Zen identity, connecting practitioners directly to the Buddha.
    * Lineage diagrams symbolize the transmission of Dharma through generations.
    * The "lineage paradigm" can be understood as a model that simplifies reality.
    * Lineage diagrams serve as centering devices for creating and stabilizing Chan/Zen identity.

* **Examples:** 
    * Tamamura Takeji's critique of the accuracy of lineage diagrams.
    * Analysis of Song dynasty China and Kamakura/early Muromachi Japan examples.

## Chan/Zen Above All Things

* Hu Shi argued that Chan Buddhism should be understood within its historical and sociocultural context.
* He believed that Chan was one among many philosophical schools in Chinese thought history.

## Suzuki's Response

* Suzuki disagreed with Hu, arguing that scholarly analysis could not grasp the essence of Zen.
* He believed that Zen pointed directly to one's true nature and transcended intellectual understanding.
* Suzuki asserted that only those who belonged to the Zen tradition could truly understand it.

## Contemporary Echoes

* Genpo Döring, a modern Zen master, echoes Suzuki's view by emphasizing the centrality of seated meditation and dismissing other Buddhist traditions as straying from the original teachings.
* Sheng Yen similarly claims that Chan/Zen represents the true essence of Buddhism, implying that other schools are deficient forms of it.

## Strategies of Exclusion and Integration

* Chan/Zen employs strategies to protect its identity: exclusion (rejecting external criticism) and integration (hierarchically incorporating alternative claims).

## Communal Memory and Lineage

* The construction and maintenance of communal memory are crucial for Chan/Zen's self-representation.
* Lineage diagrams serve as symbolic representations of authenticity and transmission, centering the community and providing a model for future development.

## The Myth Of Origin: Authenticity And Transmission In Chan/Zen

* Chan/Zen distinguishes itself from other Buddhist schools by emphasizing authenticity and transmission rather than doctrinal tenets, scriptures, or commentaries.
* It views other approaches as indirect and inauthentic, while Chan/Zen offers direct access to Buddhahood through meditation, emulation of enlightened masters, and transcending rational thought.

## The Four Axioms

* Chan/Zen's core principles are encapsulated in the "four axioms" (*shiku*), which highlight a special transmission outside scriptures, reliance on direct experience rather than words, pointing to the inherent Buddha-nature, and achieving enlightenment through self-realization.
* These axioms, though presented as ancient, were likely formulated during the Song dynasty by combining existing discursive strands.

## Anti-Textual Rhetoric

* Suzuki's presentation of the *shiku* draws a parallel with Nichiren Buddhism's "Four Guiding Utterances," which denounce other Buddhist schools as heretical.
* This suggests Chan/Zen adopts a similar stance, negating the efficacy of scriptural traditions and emphasizing its unique direct transmission.

## Transmission as Centering Element

* Despite its anti-textual rhetoric, Chan/Zen maintains cohesion through the concept of transmission, which serves as a unifying thread across generations.
* The tradition traces its lineage back to the Buddha's transmission to Mahākāśyapa, symbolized by the flower sermon story.

## The Flower Sermon and *Ishin Denshin*

* The flower sermon exemplifies the core principle of *ishin denshin* ("heart-mind transmission"), where direct intuitive understanding is passed from master to disciple.
* This transmission creates a linear genealogy connecting all generations of Chan/Zen practitioners, emphasizing vertical lineage over horizontal connections.

## Lineage As A Paradigm

* Combines Indian and Chinese concepts of ancestor worship and family relations.
* Employs these family relations to identify those excluded from other schools of Buddhism.
* Reduces biographies of members to mythical tropes.
* Transmission becomes a device for authentication, focusing on the links between figures rather than the figures themselves.
* Becoming a member is tantamount to having the same intuitional experience as past patriarchs and the Buddha.

* The origin of Chan/Zen Buddhism is a singularity that forms the chain of transmission.
* This concept of an original beginning informs how the tradition remembers its history.
* The designation of a beginning involves indicating, clarifying, or defining a later time, place, or action.
* Chan/Zen genealogy gains cohesion by maintaining the integrity of the original singularity through time and space.

* While Dharma lineage is unidirectional, there's a recursive aspect to the model.
* Authentication of awakening runs from Dharma father to Dharma heir, while authentication of lineage takes the opposite direction.
* The unilinearity of the lineage paradigm goes both ways, sealing the tradition from the inside.

* Chan/Zen genealogy is not descriptive but normative-teleological.
* Its purpose is to guise methods of authentication and provide them with a sense of facticity.
* It achieves plausibility by relying on the model of family relations and the flow of time.
* Chan/Zen's Dharma lineage is authenticated by itself.

## Lineage Paradigm as Model

* Lineage diagrams are paradigms, sharing assumptions and epistemic possibilities.
* They function like models, with both possibilities and dangers.

## Lineage As A Model

* Models come in different types: scale models and structural models.
* Structural models, like those used in science, rely on homomorphism (similarity in structure) to explain a target object.
* While useful, structural models have limitations due to their reductionist nature and potential for distortion.
* They can influence our perception of reality and lead to misinterpretations if mistaken for accurate representations.

## Object and Model

* Models are intentional constructs aimed at explaining specific problems.
* The relationship between a model and its object is complex, involving both similarities (positive analogies) and differences (negative analogies).
* Models can shape our understanding of reality, potentially leading to biased interpretations.

## Lineage Diagram as a Structural Model

* The lineage diagram in Chan/Zen functions as a structural model, visualizing the transmission of Dharma from Buddha to disciples.
* It emphasizes the directness and continuity of the tradition through its vertical structure and unambiguous lines.
* The diagram serves to establish authenticity and legitimacy within the tradition by tracing the lineage back to the Buddha.

## Normativity and Limitations of the Model

* The lineage diagram, along with narratives of mind-to-mind transmission, contributes to a sense of normativity within Chan/Zen.
* This can lead to the exclusion of perspectives outside the established lineage and hinder critical analysis.
* By reducing complex historical processes to a simplified model, the diagram overlooks alternative interpretations and possibilities.

## Critical Historiography vs. Communal Memory

* Recognizing the limitations of the lineage model as a representation of reality is crucial for objective historical analysis.
* Distinguishing between idealized communal memory and critical historiography allows for a more nuanced understanding of Chan/Zen's development.

## The Terminology Of Lineage

* Terms like "Dharma succession" (*hōkei*) and "genealogy" (*keifu*) are common in Buddhist texts, but appear most frequently in Chan/Zen contexts.
* Simple transmission terms like "succeeding (in) the Dharma" (*si fa*), "entrusting the Dharma" (*fu fa*), and "transmitting the Dharma" (*chuan fa*) are widespread across various Buddhist traditions.

* Terms explicitly related to lineage construction, such as "tradition" (*zong men*), "faction" (*zongpai*), "genealogy" (*xi pu*), "Dharma descent" (*fa mai*), and "lineage diagram" (*zong pai tu*), are less common and more concentrated in Chan/Zen writings.
* The term "lineage diagram" (*zong pai tu*) appears only twice, both within Chan/Zen contexts.

*  Chan/Zen texts tend to use lineage-related terms more frequently and prominently than other Buddhist schools, suggesting a stronger emphasis on lineage in their discourses and polemics.

## Lineage In Diagram

* This section hints at a statistical distribution of terms associated with an exclusivist understanding of the Dharma lineage within Buddhist literature.
* Visual materials further corroborate this finding.

## Lineage Diagrams: Visualizing Chan/Zen Identity

* Komazawa University's *Zengaku dai-jiten* provides a detailed depiction of the Chan/Zen tradition through lineage diagrams, showcasing monovalent relations between masters and disciples.
* These diagrams allow for easy identification of intradenominational schools, factions, and sub-factions within the tradition.

## Lineage Diagrams and Chan/Zen Buddhist Identity

* While extensive, lineage diagrams do not encompass every Chan/Zen practitioner.
* Those excluded are deemed irrelevant to the tradition and not considered "real" Chan/Zen Buddhists.
* Tamamura critiques this simplistic judgment, highlighting the limitations of lineage diagrams in representing the diachronic development of the Chan/Zen tradition.

## The Oldest Lineage Diagram: *Fo zu zong pai zong tu*

* The oldest surviving lineage diagram is believed to be the *Fo zu zong pai zong tu*.
* It was compiled by Ruda, who consulted various sources like lamp records, family utterances, stele inscriptions, and biographical writings.
* Wuzhun Shifan wrote a postscript attesting to the diagram's correctness, highlighting its purpose as a self-representation of Chan Buddhism.

## Early Japanese Lineage Diagrams

* Evidence suggests the existence of Japanese lineage diagrams by the late thirteenth century.
* The *Great Diagram of Schools and Factions*, dating back to 1238, provides insights into the transmission of the lineage from Chinese master Wuzhun to his Japanese disciple Enni Ben'en.


## Dissemination and Purpose of Lineage Diagrams

* By the late Middle Ages and Edo period, lineage diagrams were widely produced in Japan, often used to distinguish one's own faction from others.
* Modern variations emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, exemplified by those found in *Zengaku dai-jiten*.

## Understanding Lineage Diagrams

* Lineage diagrams serve as representations and standardizations of collective memories or acknowledgments of lineage successions.
* They center the tradition on an unbroken series of transmission events and authentications.
* By excluding other parts of the Buddhist tradition, they contribute to the construction and preservation of a specific religious identity.

## Lineage In Relation To Religious Institutions

* Chan/Zen succession in a lineage reflected continuation of tradition, spiritual prestige, and practical implications for instructing practitioners.
* Early Song dynasty Chan monasteries (Five Mountains) were sprawling complexes with hundreds of monks, often state-sponsored and serving as centers of learning and culture.

## The Five Mountains System 

*  The Five Mountains system required an intricate procedure for abbot succession involving a ballot and lottery to prevent nepotism.
* Factionalism was discouraged in the highest-ranking establishments associated with the Five Mountains.

## Zen Establishment in Japan

* Eisai's project was revivalist, while Dōgen Kigen and Enni Ben'en presented a viable alternative to conventional Buddhism through newly established Zen schools.
* Enni's Tōfuku monastery was seen as the first establishment dedicated to Chan/Zen teachings and practices in Japan.

## Tōfuku-ji: A Hereditary Temple

*  Tōfuku-ji practiced hereditary succession of abbots, unlike the anti-factional model of the Chinese Five Mountains system.
* Despite this exception, most newly established Zen monasteries in Japan initially followed the Ten Directions system (*jippō jūji*) for abbot succession.

## Decline of the Ten Directions System

* The *tsuchien* (hereditary temple) model, exemplified by Tōfuku-ji, gained prominence over time due to political reasons.
* By the sixteenth century, the Ten Directions system disappeared as Zen institutions lost their connection with political power during Japan's transition to early modernity.
* Modern Rinzai Zen follows the Hakuin lineage, which emerged during the Edo period and incorporated the remnants of various ancient lineages. 




## Lineage Personified

* In early Japanese Zen Buddhism, lineage considerations did not play a significant role as they do in later representations.


* Examples include Lanxi Daolong, who emphasized harmony among factions despite their different lineages, and Wuxue Zuyuan, who claimed inheritance from one lineage while acknowledging awakenings under masters from other lineages.

## The Solidification of Lineage

* Around a century after Chan/Zen arrived in Japan, the concept of lineage solidified.
* Chūgan Engetsu's insistence on identifying with a lesser-known lineage over his primary teacher led to an attack by the congregation, highlighting the importance placed on lineage loyalty.

## Peregrination and Shifting Memories

* The practice of peregrination allowed disciples to train under different masters, fostering cooperation and cross-lineage learning.
* Musō Soseki's experience with Yishan Yining and Kōhō Kennichi exemplifies this cooperative spirit.

## Changing Representations

* Over time, the remembrances of masters and their relationships evolved to serve different purposes.
* Early accounts of Yishan Yining portray him as an equal to Kōhō Kennichi, engaging in a friendly exchange.
* Later representations paint Yishan as an impostor compared to Shūhō Myōchō, highlighting the shift towards emphasizing lineage purity and authenticity.

## Lineage as a Marker of Authenticity

* By the sixteenth century, lineage served not only to distinguish Chan/Zen from other schools but also to identify authentic versus inauthentic transmissions within the tradition.
* Yishan is associated with mainstream institutions perceived as lacking creativity, while Shūhō's rough-hewn Zen is celebrated for its authenticity and uncompromising pursuit of awakening.

## Concluding Remarks

* Lineage diagrams are symbolic representations of the Chan/Zen tradition's central ideas regarding authenticity and transmission.

* They depict a unidirectional flow of transmission from past Buddhas to Shakyamuni, then to Kāśyapa, Bodhidharma, and Chinese patriarchs.

* The diagrams can be read in two ways:
    * Forward: showing the historical development of the tradition.
    * Backward: tracing a master's lineage back to the Buddha, asserting their authority.

* This backward reading allows for a teleological interpretation, emphasizing the main transmission line and downplaying offshoots or competing traditions.

## Bibliography

* The bibliography lists numerous academic works on Chan/Zen Buddhism, including books by authors like McRae, Broughton, Cole, Collcutt, Döll, Dorin Genpo Zenji, Geertz, Hartmann, Hegel, Hu Shih, Kamata Shigeo, Kirchner, Kraft, LaFleur, Nakagawa Tokunosuke, Niethammer, Said, Schleiermacher, Sheng Yen, Suyama Chōji, Suzuki Daisetsu Teitaro, Takenuki Genshō, Tamamura Takeji, Tanaka Hiromi, Tōkyō daigaku shiryō hensan-jo, Welter, and Zengaku daijiten hensanjo.

* These works cover various aspects of Chan/Zen Buddhism, such as its history, philosophy, practice, and literature.

# Chapter 5

* This chapter analyzes communities of memory and how they influence religious identity construction and legitimization of the present.

* It focuses on the Fuhui Pagoda in Taiwan, exploring its role in shaping the identity of the resident monastic community.

* The study examines the pagoda's connection to cross-strait relations and post-colonial identity formation through visual and material culture, particularly portraits.


## Micro-History And Network-Based History

* This section argues for the importance of micro-history in understanding macro-historical trends.
* It proposes a network-based history approach to analyze Buddhist history in China and Taiwan, moving beyond dynastic periodization.
* The Fuhui Pagoda serves as a case study to understand cross-strait relations, identity formation in Taiwanese Buddhism, lineage construction, and the concept of "school."

## Yinshun And The Debates About His Legacy

* This section focuses on the history of the Fuhui Pagoda and its connection to the legacy of Yinshun, a prominent monk.
* It highlights an ongoing debate among Taiwanese scholars about Yinshun's tradition and lineage.
* Yinshun's life and work are examined, including his migration from mainland China to Taiwan and the establishment of key Buddhist centers like Fuyan Vihāra and Huiri Lecture Hall.

## History Of The Fuhui Pagoda

* There has been little scholarly attention paid to the Fuhui Pagoda. 
* Existing descriptions are brief and lack detail.
* This study argues that the pagoda's history sheds light on the development of a distinct identity for Yinshun's monastic network, as well as the broader history of Taiwanese Buddhism.

## How Does Yinshun's Community View The Pagoda?

* The monks interred in the pagoda are not major figures in Chinese or Taiwanese Buddhist history.
* They were crucial in developing Yinshun's two main centers: Huiri Lecture Hall and Fuyan Vihāra.
* They played a key role in structuring and improving the Sangha education system at the Fuyan Buddhist Institute.

## The Three Phases of Development

* **Phase 1 (1958):**  The pagoda was built to house the relics of Yinshun's tonsure master, Qingnian.
    * A ceremony marking the installation of Qingnian's relics took place on February 2, 1958.
* **Phase 2 (1967):** A larger pagoda was erected next to the first one after the passing of Yinshun's fellow cleric Xuming.
    * This pagoda was intended to house the relics of monks affiliated with Fuyan.
    * Relics and photos of other monks linked to Fuyan and Huiri were deposited in the pagoda between the 1970s and Yinshun's death in 2005.
* **Phase 3 (2005-2013):** Following Yinshun's death, the second pagoda was renovated and enlarged.

## The Monks Interred in the Pagoda

* **Qingnian:** Yinshun's tonsure master.
* **Xuming:** A monk who dedicated his life to improving Sangha education.
* **Taixu:** A prominent reformer of Chinese Buddhism.
* **Daxing:** A close associate of Taixu and active in Buddhist institutes.
* **Yanpei:** A disciple of Taixu, Daxing, and Yinshun, known for spreading "Buddhism for the Human Realm."
* **Houji:** A disciple of Yinshun who served as abbot of Fuyan Vihāra.
* **Guangshan:** Ran the Huiri Lecture Hall and Fuyan Vihāra.
* **Xingfan:** Entered monkhood at a late age and served as abbot of both Huiri Lecture Hall and Fuyan Vihāra.
* **Huansheng:** Initially affiliated with Cihang's community before joining Yinshun's network.
* **Changjue:** A long-time follower of Yinshun who contributed to the development of the Fuyan Buddhist Institute.
* **Renjun:** An important member of Yinshun's community and a key figure in the Yinshun Foundation.
* **Zhenhua:** Served as a teacher and dean at the Fuyan Buddhist Institute.

## Significance of the Pagoda

* The pagoda serves as a physical manifestation of the history and identity of Yinshun's monastic network.
* It reflects the development of Taiwanese Buddhism in the post-colonial era.
* The pagoda's expansion after Yinshun's death highlights the community's desire to preserve his legacy and teachings.

## The Making Of Fuhui Buddhism

* Yinshun's death in 2005 brought attention to the Fuhui Pagoda and sparked discussions about his legacy.
* Non-Buddhist media focused on Yinshun's role in Taiwanese identity, while Buddhist organizations highlighted his contributions to Buddhism.

## Debates Surrounding Yinshun's Lineage

* The term "Buddhism for the Human Realm" (*renjian fojiao*) became closely associated with Yinshun.
* Discussions arose about a lineage transmission from Taixu to Zhengyan through Yinshun, forming a "Bodhisattva Sangha Community".
* Scholars debated whether Yinshun belonged to the Putuoshan lineage or represented a new school of Buddhism in Taiwan.

## The Concept of "Yinshun Doctrinal Lineage" (*xuepai*)

* The term *xuepai* emerged to describe a loose network of individuals spreading Yinshun's teachings, but its definition was contested.
* Lan Jifu proposed different branches within the *xuepai*, including groups led by Chuandao, Zhaohui, and Hongyin.
* Zhengyan and Tzu Chi were excluded from the *xuepai* due to their focus on social welfare rather than scholarly knowledge of Buddhism.

## Yinshun's Views on Lineage and Dharma Transmission

* Yinshun rejected belonging to any school or sect (*zongpai*) and transmitting the Dharma in a traditional sense.
* He believed that focusing on differences between schools distracted from the core teachings of Buddhism.
* Despite rejecting lineage, Yinshun established institutions like the Fuhui Monastic Community and the Yinshun Cultural Foundation, which functioned similarly to traditional monastic structures.

## The Role of the Fuhui Pagoda

* The Fuhui Pagoda was intended to house the relics of Yinshun's tonsure master Qingnian and monks associated with Fuyan.
* It symbolized a community or network connected to Yinshun but not necessarily a distinct lineage or school.




# The Fuhui Monastic Community

* This monastic assembly was active in the 1970s, meeting a few times a year.
* Its membership changed over time, with new monastics introduced by the original group.
* Yinshun selected the first members, while later decisions were made by early members.
* Changes were made to maintain continuity with Yinshun's original pattern.

# Dharma Transmission And Lineage In Modern Chinese Buddhism

* The *Fuhui sengtuan* selects new abbots for Huiri and Fuyan, changing the abbotship every four or five years according to Yinshun's will.
* Members are not only Yinshun's students, and those selected for abbotship may not be members of the Community.
* This procedure is debated as a form of Dharma transmission.

# Yinshun Also Recalled Taixu'S Argument Explicitly:

* Yinshun considered the idea of transmitting the Dharma as wrong in its basic formulation.
* He believed the Dharma could not belong to anyone and therefore couldn't be transmitted.
* Neither Taixu nor Yinshun performed a classical ceremony of Dharma transmission at the end of their lives.




## Fuhui Pagoda And Yinshun'S Network

* The Fuhui Pagoda silently conveys a different version of the nature and scope of Yinshun's network compared to media narratives.
* A study of the monks included in the pagoda reveals a three-generational pattern, showcasing Yinshun's lineage and network.
* The pagoda's organizational structure after 2006 highlights Yinshun's legacy by including images and remains of peers, students, and disciples from both mainland China and Taiwan.

## Looking at the Monks Interred in the Fuhui Pagoda

* The monks interred in the Fuhui Pagoda share a commitment to sacrificing their body and mind for the Sangha and the world.
* The placement of portraits highlights generational and hierarchical divisions within Yinshun's network.
* Most individuals included in the pagoda are from mainland China, emphasizing cross-strait relations between Taiwan and mainland China.

## Significance of Cross-Strait Links and Lineage Construction

* Yinshun's network is rooted in Taixu's faction of early Republican Buddhism, highlighting a connection to reformist segments of the Sangha in early twentieth-century China.
* The presence of Yinshun's relics in both Taiwan and mainland China underscores the importance of cross-strait links.
*  The Fuhui Pagoda embodies a concrete and visible form of Yinshun's monastic network, shaped through verbal expressions, inscriptions, and a naming system.

## Fuyan Identity and Lineage Construction

* The term "Fuyan ren" identifies those whose relics are deposited in the pagoda and those who have studied at the Fuyan Vihāra.
* Zhenhua's "Fuyan motto" outlines identity markers for the Fuyan Buddhist Institute and its people, emphasizing contentment, rectifying distorted views, benefiting others, and promoting correct practice and Dharma study.




## Lineage And Funerary Spaces In Contemporary China And Taiwan

* This paper examines how Buddhist communities in modern Taiwan construct identity and link the past, present, and future through funerary spaces and lineage.
* It uses Fuyan Buddhist Institute and four major Taiwanese Buddhist groups (Tzu Chi, Foguangshan, Fagushan, and Zhongtai Chan monastery) as case studies.

## The Four Big Mountains

* These groups represent landmarks of Taiwanese Buddhism and have strong senses of identification.
* Unlike Fuyan, these communities label lay followers as belonging to their in-group.
* Tzu Chi and Fagushan established their own schools ("Tzu Chi school" and "Fagu school"), contrasting with Fuyan's rejection of creating a new school.

## Establishing New Schools

* Shengyan (Fagushan) and Zhengyan (Tzu Chi) justified the creation of their schools based on unique practices and doctrinal foundations.
* This move was met with criticism from Taiwanese scholars who argued that schools are traditionally constructed retrospectively, not by founders.

## Memorial Spaces and Lineage

* The paper compares Fuyan's Fuhui Pagoda with Fagushan and Foguangshan's approaches to memorial spaces.
* Foguangshan enshrines the ashes of its founder (Xingyun) and abbot (Xinping) in a dedicated mausoleum, while also including tablets and ashes of lay followers.
* Fagushan created the Life Memorial Garden, which welcomes both monastics and lay followers, reflecting Shengyan's inclusive vision.

## Online Pagodas

* The paper explores online pagodas on temple websites as examples of how digital spaces can be used to construct lineage and communal genealogy.
* Nanputuo Temple's online pagoda includes Taixu, highlighting his significance as a patriarch of Buddhism for the Human World, a concept embraced by both Nationalist and Communist regimes in China.




# Rituals and Political Legitimacy

* Buddhist institutions in Taiwan have strong ties to political leaders.
* These links are reinforced through funerary rituals held at pagodas or sacred spaces.
* Examples include Ma Yingjiu and Chen Shuibian paying homage to Yinshun and Ma Yingjiu burying Shengyan's ashes.

# The Fuhui Pagoda: A Multifunctional Space

* Classified as a *śārīraka stūpa*, *pāribhogika stūpa*, and *uddeśika stūpa*.
* Contains relics, images, and words of important Buddhist figures.
* Serves as a memorial site and a visible reminder of the Buddhist community's history.

# The Fuhui Pagoda: Symbols and Meanings

* Functions as a place of ritual, art, and history.
* Portraits within the pagoda serve as symbols linking different orders (pagoda, human body, social body, cosmos).
* These orders remain distinct but are interconnected through the pagoda and the community.

# The Fuhui Pagoda and Taiwanese Identity

* Linked to the fragile sense of Taiwanese identity.
* Represents an imagined community sharing cultural roots and centered around the pagoda.
* Reflects national shifts and debates, particularly cross-strait tensions from the late 1950s to the early 1990s.

# The Fuhui Pagoda: A Visual Narrative

* Presents a visual narrative of Buddhism and Buddhists in Taiwan during a period of transition.
* Documents their migration and experiences across different phases of Taiwanese history.
* Reflects the evolution of Buddhism in Taiwan, from Free China to a new form of Taiwanese Buddhism.


# Network-Oriented History and Cross-Strait Relations

* The Fuhui Pagoda embodies a network-oriented history of Buddhism in Taiwan.
* This history intersects with complex cross-strait relations.
* Empty funerary squares symbolize the intention to include future figures and tell the ongoing story of this network.
