# 1. Introduction

* Buddhist teaching and Buddhist philosophy are distinct, though related.
*  The Buddha avoided speculation and 'philosophically' important questions.
* This book focuses on Buddhist teachings based on their importance in the path to liberation.
* Insight or wisdom (prajñā) is crucial for liberation and often described in Buddhist texts.
* Buddhist teaching also includes instructions for spiritual practice, concepts of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and beliefs not directly related to liberation.
* This book provides a selective overview of Buddhist teachings in India, focusing on their connections and historical context. 




# 2. The Teaching Of The **Buddha**

* Hermann Oldenberg's groundbreaking work on Buddhism focused on "the teachings of Buddhism" rather than "the teaching(s) of the Buddha," suggesting uncertainty about the Buddha's actual teachings.
* Helmuth von Glasenapp, while agreeing with Oldenberg's view, believed that the core ideas of Buddhism could be traced back to the Buddha himself, particularly in the dharma theory.

*  Glasenapp argued that early Buddhist tradition already contained essential ideas found refined in later works like the *Abhidharmakośa*.
* Franklin Edgerton challenged Glasenapp's view, pointing out passages where the Buddha explicitly refused to engage in philosophical speculations.

* The Cūḻa-Māluṅ*kya-Sutta* exemplifies this refusal, with the Buddha declining to answer questions about the nature of the world and the afterlife.
* Edgerton argued that these contradictory passages suggest either the Buddha rejected metaphysical teachings or taught a metaphysical doctrine himself, but not both.

*  Glasenapp countered that the coexistence of these passages doesn't necessarily mean all metaphysical problems were considered unsolvable.
* The controversy highlights the need for critical examination of ancient discourses and suggests a method for distinguishing older from later teachings based on identifying contradictions.

* Some scholars argue that very little of the original teaching of the Buddha has been preserved in the Buddhist canon, suggesting that only passages contradicting canonical positions represent "pre-canonical Buddhism."
* Others believe the true nature of earliest Buddhism is found not in the ancient discourses but in the inscriptions of Aśoka.




# We, cautiously, opt for the general principle that the teaching that the ancient discourses ascribe to the Buddha can indeed be ascribed to him

* Only where there are reasons to doubt the authenticity of a certain teaching should we deviate from this principle.

# Main Teachings

* The Buddha preached what is conducive to the holy life and to peace and enlightenment: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.
* This message is repeated frequently in Buddhist texts.
* These four truths are known as the Four Noble Truths.

# The Path to Liberation 

* The Buddha taught a method to put an end to suffering.
* The so-called first sermon of the Blessed One contains an explanation of these Four Noble Truths:
    * Suffering
    * Origin of Suffering
    * Cessation of Suffering
    * Path which leads to the cessation of suffering (The Noble Eightfold Path)

* The Noble Eightfold Path provides no details of the method taught by the Buddha. 
* Canonical texts contain a more detailed description of the path to liberation, which is repeated at several places:
    * A Buddha appears in the world and teaches this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās.
    * He preaches the teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.
    * A householder or householder's son hears that teaching and acquires faith in the Buddha.

* The text then outlines a detailed description of the path to liberation, including:
    * Going forth from home life into homelessness.
    * Abstaining from killing living beings, taking what has not been given, unchastity, false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, gossip.
    * Practising eating only in one part of the day, abstaining from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical shows. 
    * Abstaining from wearing garlands, smartening himself with scent, and embellishing himself with unguents.
    * Abstaining from high and large couches, accepting gold and silver, accepting raw grain, etc.

* He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach.




# On Seeing a Form

* He does not grasp at signs and features when seeing a form with the eye.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his eye faculty.

# On Hearing a Sound

* He does not grasp at signs and features when hearing a sound with the ear.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his ear faculty.

# On Smelling an Odour

* He does not grasp at signs and features when smelling an odour with the nose.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his nose faculty.

# On Tasting a Flavour

* He does not grasp at signs and features when tasting a flavour with the tongue.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his tongue faculty.

# On Touching a Tangible

* He does not grasp at signs and features when touching a tangible with the body.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his body faculty.

# On Cognizing a Mental Property

* He does not grasp at signs and features when cognizing a mental property with the mind.
* To avoid evil unwholesome states, he practices restraint and guards his mind faculty.

# Noble Restraint of the Faculties

* Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences inner bliss.

# Mindfulness in Daily Activities

* He acts with full awareness in all daily activities: walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, talking, and being silent.

# Secluded Resting Place

* Possessing mindfulness and restraint, he seeks a secluded resting place like a forest or cave.
* After his meal, he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body erect, and establishes mindfulness before him.

# Abandonment of Hindrances

* He abandons covetousness, ill will, sloth, restlessness, and doubt, purifying his mind from these hindrances.

# First Stage of Meditation

* Secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental properties, he enters the first stage of meditation with deliberation, reflection, pleasure, and joy.

# Second Stage of Meditation

* With the stilling of deliberation and reflection, he enters the second stage with internal quiet and singleness of mind, accompanied by pleasure and joy.

# Third Stage of Meditation

* With the fading away of pleasure, he abides in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, experiencing bodily pleasure.
* This stage is characterized by pleasant abiding due to equanimity and mindfulness.

# Fourth Stage of Meditation

* Abandoning joy and suffering, he enters the fourth stage with neither-suffering-nor-joy and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.

# Origin and Form of the Description

* The description of the path to liberation may coincide with the historical Buddha's teachings but its form may be influenced by later scholasticism.
* The third stage description, mentioning "noble ones," likely originated after the Buddha.

# Insights at Liberation

* These insights are crucial in Buddhism and were claimed to have been discovered by the Buddha at his liberation.
* They include understanding suffering, its origin, cessation, and the way leading to cessation, as well as the taints, their origin, cessation, and the way leading to their cessation.

# Liberation from Taints

* When he knows these truths, his mind is liberated from the taints of desire, being, and ignorance.
* He understands that birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, and he will not return.

# Liberation in This Lifetime

* This passage indicates liberation occurs during the practitioner's lifetime, not at death.
* Other texts also support this view.

# Liberating Knowledge

* This concept may have been influenced by other movements, as Buddhism was initially subject to external influences.

## Self And Liberating Knowledge

* The Buddha's teachings shared some common ground with other contemporary philosophies but also introduced new concepts.
* The belief in rebirth was prevalent in ancient India and predates Buddhism. 
* While both Buddhism and Jainism believed in karma, they differed in their understanding of its nature: Buddhism emphasized intention (*cetanā*) as a key factor.

* The Four Noble Truths highlight desire (thirst) as the cause of rebirth, while the path to liberation focuses on actions (*karman*). This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by recognizing that thirst drives humans to act.
* While Buddhism accepted the concepts of rebirth and liberation, its novelty lay in its specific method for achieving liberation.

* Buddhism emerged within a cultural context where non-Vedic beliefs and practices were influential. The Upanishads exemplify this blend of Vedic and non-Vedic thought.
* Understanding Buddhist teachings requires considering the philosophical landscape of ancient India, including non-Buddhist methods and critiques.

* A key passage in the Buddhist canon discusses whether the Five Aggregates (physical and mental components) constitute the self (*anātman*). 
* The passage suggests that the self is not permanent, joyful, or unchanging, but it doesn't explicitly deny its existence.
* This passage contrasts with non-Buddhist views that emphasized knowledge of a permanent self as the path to liberation.

* Buddhism arose during a time when various individuals and groups sought liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Some believed in suppressing actions, while others focused on attaining knowledge of a permanent self.

## The Self and Liberating Knowledge in Early Buddhism

* This section discusses the Buddhist concept of the self (ātman) and its relation to liberation.
* It contrasts the Buddhist view with other contemporary traditions, particularly Vedic thought, which emphasized the importance of knowledge for attaining liberation.
* The text suggests that early Buddhists were familiar with these alternative paths to liberation but ultimately rejected them.

## The Five Aggregates and the Concept of Person

* This section introduces the concept of the Five Aggregates (skandha) - form, sensations, ideations, conditioned factors, and consciousness - as components of a person.
* It explains that Buddhists do not view these aggregates as constituting the self but rather as impermanent phenomena.
* The text notes the importance of this concept in later Buddhist thought, particularly its role in understanding the nature of suffering and liberation.

## Liberating Knowledge: Different Perspectives

* This section explores the question of what constitutes liberating knowledge in Buddhism.
* It highlights the diversity of perspectives within early Buddhist texts, with different sources emphasizing various types of knowledge, such as the destruction of taints, knowledge of past lives, or understanding the impermanence of the Five Aggregates.
* The text also mentions the later incorporation of doctrines like Conditioned Origination and the selflessness of the person into the concept of liberating knowledge.

## Knowledge of the Destruction of Taints: A Closer Look

* This section focuses on the knowledge of the destruction of taints (āsrava) as a path to liberation.
* It analyzes the description of this knowledge in the text, pointing out some irregularities and inconsistencies.
* The text suggests that the Four Noble Truths are presented as part of this liberating knowledge but also notes their presence in the Buddha's first sermon, raising questions about the precise nature and scope of this knowledge.

## # Liberating Knowledge

- The Four Noble Truths are not considered liberating knowledge in their entirety.
- The Buddha's enlightenment involved understanding the first truth, destroying the content of the second truth, realizing the third truth, and practicing the fourth truth.
- Early Buddhists may have lacked a specific concept of liberating knowledge due to the religious context of the time.

## # Liberating Knowledge in the First Sermon

- Some versions of the Buddha's first sermon mention the Four Noble Truths as liberating knowledge.
- Other versions portray the Buddha teaching privately without formulating any specific knowledges.
- In some versions, five monks attain liberation during the second sermon by listening to the discourse on non-self.

## # Contrasting Paths to Liberation

- The path to liberation is depicted differently in various texts: through solitary mystical experiences versus listening to liberating knowledge in a group setting.
- This contrast highlights different ideas about achieving enlightenment within early Buddhist thought.

## # Musīla and Nārada

- Two monks, Musīla and Nārada, demonstrate contrasting views on attaining Arhatship despite possessing similar knowledge.
- Musīla believes he is an Arhat based on his understanding of Conditioned Origination and the cessation of becoming (Nirvana).
- Nārada, while knowing the same concepts, does not consider himself an Arhat.

## # The Influence of Non-Buddhist Movements

- The presence of liberating knowledge in Buddhist texts can be explained by its prevalence in other religious movements of the time.
- The concept of non-self as liberating knowledge mirrors similar ideas found in non-Buddhist traditions.
- This suggests that early Buddhism may have borrowed and adapted concepts from its contemporaries.

## # Prajñā (Wisdom)

- "Prajñā" is a term frequently used in Buddhist texts, often associated with right view and enlightenment.
- Attempts to define the precise content of "prajñā" likely emerged from its presence in early Buddhist teachings.

## # Reconciling Contradictory Teachings

- Discrepancies in Buddhist texts regarding liberating knowledge require explanation for both scholars and Buddhists themselves.
- The doctrine of Conditioned Origination may offer a systematic solution by integrating seemingly contradictory teachings into a broader vision.

## # Conditioned Origination

- Ignorance is identified as the root cause of rebirth and suffering according to the doctrine of Conditioned Origination.
- This contrasts with the Four Noble Truths, where thirst is presented as the primary cause of suffering.
- The doctrine explains how ignorance leads to conditioned factors, consciousness, and ultimately, suffering.

# Consciousness

* There are six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. 


# Conditioned Factors

* There are three kinds of conditioned factors: the bodily conditioned factor, the verbal conditioned factor, the mental conditioned factor.

# Ignorance

* Not knowing suffering, not knowing the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

# Origin of Suffering

* With ignorance as condition conditioned factors come to be; with conditioned factors as condition consciousness [...] Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.
* But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of conditioned factors; with the cessation of conditioned factors, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of the six realms of the senses; with the cessation of the six realms of the senses comes cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact comes the cessation of sensation; with the cessation of sensation comes the cessation of thirst; with the cessation of thirst, comes the cessation of clinging, with the cessation of clinging comes the cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence come the cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, displeasure, and despair. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.

# Name-and-Form

* Sensation, ideation, volition, contact, attention: this is called name.
* The four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements: this is called form. 
* Thus this name and this form are together called name-and-form.

# Six Realms of the Senses

* The eye realm, ear realm, nose realm, tongue realm, body realm, mind realm. These are called the six realms of the senses.

# Contact

* There are six classes of contact: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact. 

# Sensation

* There are six classes of sensation: sensation born of eye-contact, sensation born of ear-contact, sensation born of nose-contact, sensation born of tongue-contact, sensation born of body-contact, sensation born of mind-contact.

# Thirst

* There are these six classes of thirst: thirst for forms, thirst for sounds, thirst for odours, thirst for flavours, thirst for tangibles, thirst for mental properties.

# Clinging

* There are these four kinds of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and vows, clinging to a doctrine of self.

# Existence

* There are these three kinds of existence: existence in the sphere of desire (kāma), existence in the sphere of form (rūpa), existence in the sphere of non-form (arūpa).

# Birth

* The birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent [into the womb], production, the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the realms of the senses. This is called birth.

# Aging-and-Death

* The aging of the various orders of beings, their growing old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of vitality, degeneration of the faculties: this is called aging.
* The passing away of the various beings from the various orders of beings, their perishing, breakup, disappearance, mortality, death, completion of time, the break up of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this is called death.



## Asceticism And Meditation

* The Buddha's path to liberation is described as the Middle Path, avoiding both indulgence in sense pleasures and self-mortification.

* This doctrine likely arose in response to ascetics who practiced self-mortification for religious goals.

* Buddhist discourses often mention encounters with Jain ascetics who believed that suppressing all activities would lead to liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

* The Buddha criticizes their practices, pointing out the pain and suffering they cause without leading to enlightenment.

* Despite criticizing these ascetic practices, the Buddha himself is depicted as having undertaken similar practices in his quest for enlightenment before realizing their futility.

* The Buddha acknowledges the difficulty of suppressing sensory input but suggests that focusing on inner stillness is a more effective path to liberation.

# The Rain-God and the Buddha

* Two farmers, brothers, and four oxen were killed by a storm.
* A man asked Pukkusa why he didn't see or hear the storm.
* Pukkusa said he saw and heard nothing.
* The man was amazed by Pukkusa's calmness.

# Rejected Practices in Buddhism

* Practices rejected by the Buddha sometimes found their way into Buddhism.
* This likely happened due to rivalry between religious groups.
* Buddhists couldn't admit that non-Buddhist teachers had skills the Buddha didn't possess.

# Ārāḍa Kālāma and Udraka

* Ārāḍa Kālāma was one of the Buddha's teachers before enlightenment.
* The Buddha learned the Realm of Nothingness from Ārāḍa Kālāma.
* He learned the Realm of Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation from Udraka, the son of Rāma.

# Realms of Attainment

* These realms involve suppressing thoughts and mental activities.
* They contrast with the stages of meditation, which lead to enlightenment.
* Despite being rejected by the Buddha, these realms found a place in Buddhist tradition.

# The Buddha's Death

* The Buddha entered various meditative states before his death.
* He passed through the Realms of Infinity of Space, Consciousness, Nothingness, and Neither Ideation nor Non-ideation.
* He finally attained Cessation of Ideation and Feeling before passing away.

# Enlightenment and the Cessation of Ideation

* The Buddha also experienced these realms during his enlightenment.
* He realized full awakening only after emerging from them.
* This suggests that enlightenment cannot occur in a state of complete mental suppression.




## Recapitulation

* Distinguishes between doctrines confidently ascribed to the historical Buddha and those not part of his original teaching.
* Concludes that a sizable portion of what is attributed to the Buddha was not taught by him.

## Teachings Not Attributed to the Buddha

* Two types: teachings on liberating knowledge and those related to ascetic movements.
* Liberating knowledge: no consensus in Buddhist tradition on its exact content; idea of explicitly formulated liberating knowledge likely influenced by non-Buddhist currents.
* Ascetic movements: aimed at suppressing bodily and mental processes, reflected in certain mental exercises and physical asceticism found in Buddhist texts.

## Influences on Buddhism

* Two currents within Buddhism - intellectual (Sāṃkhya) and ascetic (Yoga) - parallel to those in the *Bhagavadg*ītā.
* These currents developed under the influence of non-Buddhist movements, but Buddhism integrated these influences while maintaining its own specificity.

## The Buddha's Original Teaching

* Aim: to stop suffering and rebirth.
* Path: emphasizes consciousness through awareness practices and Four Stages of Meditation.
* Highest stage: wisdom (*prajñ*ā) enables a decisive transformation leading to the goal.

## Distinctiveness of Buddhism

* Radically different from other teachings of its time.
* Buddha claimed to have discovered something new.
* Not a type of Yoga; classical Yoga was influenced by Buddhism.

## Buddhist Method vs. Alternatives

* Two alternative methods: suppressing mental and bodily activities or realizing the self does not participate in actions.
* These methods offered obvious solutions, while the Buddhist method seemed ill-suited to ending rebirth.

## Incorporation of Alternative Practices

* Buddhists incorporated practices and ideas from alternative methods due to the perceived inadequacy of their own method.
* This resulted in a variety of methods within the Buddhist textual corpus.

## Internal Dynamic of Buddhism

* The doctrine of Non-Self, deeply ingrained in tradition, posed a challenge to the Buddhist method.
* This conflict fueled the further development of Buddhism. 




# 3. Arranging The **Doctrine**

* Shortly before his death, the Buddha taught his disciple Ānanda that the doctrine (*dharma*) and discipline (*vinaya*) would be their teachers after his demise.
* The Buddha's disciples preserved his discourses and disciplinary rules, and also studied and arranged them into lists of concepts like the Four Noble Truths and the Five Aggregates (*skandha*).

* This tendency to enumerate is also found in Jainism.

* Buddhists collected existing lists of concepts to create a new presentation of the path to liberation, which became known as the Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment (bodhipakṣyā˙ / bodhipākṣikā˙ dharmā˙).
* These thirty-seven concepts were seen as the essence of Buddhist doctrine and practice.

* This list was important for the arrangement of the doctrine and became the basis for additions and extraneous enlargements.


# The word *dharma*

* *Dharma* means "doctrine". 
* It is also used in another sense, which underwent a semantic change over time.

# The Meaning of Dharma

*  The word *dharma* means something akin to "mental property" or "characteristic of the mind".
* This meaning is illustrated in passages describing the path to liberation, where it refers to mental properties that should be restrained.
* Examples include covetousness, ill will, sloth, restlessness, and doubt.

# Applications of Dharma

* The term *dharma* also appears in connection with mindfulness practices, specifically "application of mindfulness to dharmas".
* Initially, these dharmas likely referred to the Seven Helpful Means to Enlightenment (e.g., mindfulness, understanding the doctrine, energy).
* Later, they may have included the Five Hindrances (desire, malice, sloth, irritation, doubt) and six fetters.

# Four Exertion

* The four exertions in Buddhist practice involve working with wholesome and unwholesome dharmas.
* These exertions aim to prevent bad dharmas from arising, abandon existing bad dharmas, cultivate good dharmas, and protect existing good dharmas.

# Dharma as Mental Properties

* In all these contexts, *dharma* refers to properties of the mind, just like form is the object of the eye or sound the object of the ear.
* Dhamras can be either wholesome or unwholesome. Examples of unwholesome dharmas include desire, displeasure, malice, anger, rigidity, sloth, irritation, regret, and doubt.

# Semantic Development of Dharma

* Early Buddhists organized doctrine through numerical sequences and lists (e.g., Five Aggregates, Twelve Realms of the Senses, Eighteen Elements).
* However, these classifications were not solely about mental properties; some included physical aspects.
* The term *dharma* became associated with these broader classifications, even though they weren't originally intended as such.

# Dharma and Non-Self

* The concept of non-self (anatta) played a role in shaping the understanding of dharmas.
* Passages state that all dharmas are not self, leading to the idea that a person is a composite entity without a separate, enduring self.
* This view extended beyond the mind to encompass everything in existence as composed of dharmas.

# Consequences of Dharma Theory

* If everything is made of dharmas and persons are composites lacking inherent existence, then everyday objects also lack independent reality.
* Buddhist texts often highlight this point, arguing that things like chariots or living beings are merely designations for collections of dharmas.





## Text Summary

# If, revered Nāgasena, the person is not got at...

* This section presents a dialogue between Nāgasena and King Milinda about the existence of a self.
* Nāgasena argues that there is no permanent self because actions are done by aggregates (skandhas), not by a separate entity.
* He uses the analogy of a chariot to illustrate his point: just as a chariot is merely a designation for its parts, so too is a person a designation for their aggregates.

# Then the venerable Nāgasena spoke thus to King Milinda:

* Nāgasena continues to challenge King Milinda's belief in a self by using another analogy, this time comparing the king's chariot to the concept of "Nāgasena."
* He argues that just as the chariot is not a single entity but a collection of parts, so too is "Nāgasena" merely a designation for a collection of aggregates.

# When this had been said, the five hundred Bactrian Greeks...

* The Bactrian Greeks applaud Nāgasena's argument and challenge King Milinda to respond.
* King Milinda concedes that he was not lying when he said he came by chariot because the word "chariot" denotes a collection of parts.
* He then understands Nāgasena's point about "Nāgasena" being a designation for a collection of aggregates.

# It is wonderful, revered Nāgasena...

* King Milinda praises Nāgasena's brilliant explanations and acknowledges the validity of his arguments.

# Other early texts emphasize the non-existence of the self...

* This section discusses how other Buddhist texts also support the idea that there is no permanent self.
* It cites examples from the Śāriputrābhidharma, MahāVibhāṣā, and Visuddhimagga to illustrate this point.

# From the point of view of the Abhidharma Buddhists...

* This section explains the Abhidharma Buddhist perspective on the nature of reality.
* It states that only dharmas (mental and physical phenomena) truly exist, while composite objects like persons are mere designations.

# The world as conceived of in Abhidharma Buddhism now looks like this.

* This section summarizes the Abhidharma view of reality:
    * Dharmas are the fundamental building blocks of existence.
    * Composite objects are merely designations for collections of dharmas.
    * Language plays a crucial role in constructing our perception of reality.

# There was, however, a movement in Buddhist thought...

* This section introduces the Pudgalavāda school, which disagreed with the Abhidharma view on the non-existence of the self.
* It explains that the Pudgalavādins believed that the person is neither identical with nor different from the aggregates.




# The Pudgalavādins

* This school believed in a "person" (pudgala) as a middle ground between eternalism and annihilationism.
* They used scriptural citations to support their belief, arguing that the person is neither identical with nor different from dharmas.
* They believed that the pudgala plays a crucial role in rebirth and liberation.

# The Pudgalavāda and Mainstream Buddhism

* Most Buddhists saw everything as either conditioned (momentary) or non-conditioned (eternal).
* The Pudgalavādins argued that the pudgala belonged to its own special category, distinct from both.
* This school can be seen as an attempt to maintain a connection with everyday reality and the concept of personal responsibility.

# The Development of Buddhist Thought

* Mainstream Buddhism moved towards accepting the unreal nature of the person and the phenomenal world.
* This trend intensified in Mahāyāna Buddhism, leading to a focus on ultimate reality beyond the phenomenal world.
* The Pudgalavādins represent a dissenting voice within this development, highlighting the importance of the individual experience.

# Systematising the Dharma Theory: Sarvāstivāda

* The Sarvāstivāda school played a key role in systematizing Buddhist doctrine.
* They developed the concept of momentariness, stating that all conditioned dharmas are fleeting and impermanent.
* This school also introduced the Pañcavastuka, a new classification of dharmas into five categories: form, mind, mental dharmas, conditioned factors separated from the mind, and non-conditioned dharmas.

# The Pañcavastuka

* This system represents an advancement over earlier classifications like the Five Aggregates.
* It encompasses all dharmas within its framework, providing a more comprehensive understanding of Buddhist ontology.
* While it builds upon existing categories like the Five Aggregates, it offers a fresh perspective and deeper analysis of the nature of reality.

# The Pañcavastuka and its Significance

* It introduced a new classification system for dharmas.
* This reflected a willingness to go beyond tradition and independently analyze Buddhist teachings.
* It addressed weaknesses in the traditional Five Aggregates system.

# Material Form (Rūpa)

* Includes the four great elements (earth, water, fire, wind).
* Also includes sense organs and their objects.
* Excludes mind (*manas*) and mental properties (*dharma*), as they don't belong to this category.
* Notably excludes space (*ākāśa*), considered a non-conditioned element.
* Includes "non-information" (*avijñapti*), related to karma and invisible actions.

# Conditioned Factors Separated from the Mind (*cittaviprayukta saṃskāra*)

* Created to classify dharmas that didn't fit into the Five Aggregates.
* Highlights the Sarvāstivādins' focus on momentariness.
* Includes birth (jāti), old age (jarā), existence (*sthiti*), and impermanence (*anityatā*).

# Linguistic Dharmas

* "Body-of-word" (nāmakāya), "body-of-sentence" (*padakāya*), and "body-of-sound" (*vyañjanakāya*) were introduced.
* These address the problem of language existing in a world without temporally extended objects.
* They aim to reconcile the Buddhist worldview with the reality of words and linguistic entities.

# Community-of-Being (nikāyasabhāga)

* Allows for recognizing aggregates (*skandha*) and other groupings as such.
* Enables naming and understanding the vast number of dharmas despite their fleeting nature.

# Obtaining (prāpti)

* Introduced to explain how Arhats achieve liberation by "obtaining" certain dharmas.
* Shows the Sarvāstivādins' attempt to make the world intelligible through a detailed ontology.

# The Person

* The Sarvāstivāda school negated the existence of a permanent self (person) and instead viewed it as a collection of dharmas.
* Different persons have different sequences of dharmas.
* Actions have their effects within the sequence that makes up a person.

# Dharma "Obtaining"

* The dharma "obtaining" plays a role similar to that of a person, keeping together the dharmas belonging to one person and distinguishing them from others.
* It also explains how wholesome and unwholesome moments of thought alternate in a person's stream of consciousness.

# Non-Conditioned Dharmas

* The Sarvāstivādins recognized three non-conditioned dharmas: space, "cessation not as a result of knowledge," and "cessation through knowledge."
* These dharmas are eternal.

# Causality

* The doctrine of momentariness raised questions about the regularity of the world.
* The Sarvāstivādins explained this through the twelve-fold causal series of Conditioned Origination.
* They refined the understanding of this series, seeing its elements as states of the Five Aggregates.

# New Doctrine of Causality

* Attempts were made to develop an independent doctrine of causality.
* The Vijñānakāya distinguishes four kinds of conditions: producing condition, support, immediately contiguous condition, and determining condition.
* The Jñānaprasthāna introduces six causes: causal reason, concomitant cause, common cause, co-operative cause, all-pervading cause, and reason for ripening.

# Saṃghabhadra's Views on Causality

* Saṃghabhadra distinguished between cause and condition.
* A cause brings about the arising of an effect, while conditions contribute to the process.
* He used examples like a mother bearing a child and a foster-mother raising it to illustrate this distinction.

# Time in Sarvāstivāda

* The Sarvāstivādins believed that past, present, and future all exist.
* This belief is reflected in their name, "Sarvāstivāda," which means "everything exists."
* They argued that two moments of mind or consciousness cannot occur simultaneously in a single person.

# Mental States and Time

* The Sarvāstivādins believed that past, present, and future dharmas exist simultaneously.
* This belief was necessary to explain the contemplation of desire, which they considered a real phenomenon.
* They argued that without past and future, actions would have no effects, contradicting Buddhist doctrine.
* The existence of past dharmas also explained how consciousness could return after a period of cessation (nirodha).

# Past, Present, and Future Dharmas

* The Sarvāstivādins debated the nature of past, present, and future dharmas.
* They considered how these dharmas "travel" through time zones (*adhvan*).
* Different teachers offered various explanations for this phenomenon:
    * Dharmatrāta: State (bhāva) differentiates dharmas in different time zones.
    * Ghoṣaka: Characteristics (lakṣaṇa) differentiate dharmas.
    * Vasumitra: Position (*avasth*ā) differentiates dharmas, like calculation sticks.
    * Buddhadeva: Relation to earlier and later dharmas differentiates them.

# Efficiency as a Differentiating Factor

* The Sarvāstivādins eventually abandoned the idea of time zones because it presupposed the existence of time.
* They proposed that efficiency (*kāritra*) differentiates past, present, and future dharmas.
* Future dharmas have inactive efficiency, present dharmas have active efficiency, and past dharmas have passed efficiency.

# Atomic Conception of Time and Matter

* The Sarvāstivādins' belief in the reality of past and future dharmas led to an atomic conception of time.
* Time was seen as a never-ending series of indivisible moments.
* This atomic conception also extended to matter, with atoms being the smallest component parts.

# Atoms in Sarvāstivāda Philosophy

* While canonical texts don't mention atoms, they are discussed in later works like Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Abhidharmahṛdaya.
* Three types of atoms are distinguished: sense organ atoms, body organ atoms, and other atoms.
* Each atom is composed of specific dharmas, varying depending on the type of atom.

# Properties and Substances

* The Sarvāstivādins faced a challenge in explaining how atoms, which are composite, could be considered ultimate components.
* They argued that the dharmas within an atom can predominate more or less strongly, leading to the perception of different properties.
* This led to a blurring of the distinction between substances and properties, with both being seen as momentary dharmas.

# Origin and Purpose of Atomism

* The Sarvāstivādins' atomistic worldview likely emerged early in their development, alongside their doctrine of momentariness.
* While the Buddha discouraged metaphysical speculation, later Buddhists sought to preserve and interpret his teachings through detailed ontological analysis.
* Their focus on dharmas led them to develop a sophisticated understanding of the nature of reality, including the atomic structure of matter.

## # The Philosophical Development of Buddhism

* Buddhists were concerned with identifying and describing all dharmas.
* This led to philosophical development as a byproduct.
* Old canonical Abhidharma texts cannot be read as philosophical works.
* Philosophical thought emerged gradually.

## # Liberation and Dharma Theory

* Buddhists sought an answer to how liberation is obtained in terms of dharma theory.
* Dharmaśreṣṭhin attempted to answer this question.
* He focused on the problem of how knowledge leads to liberation, a constant companion of Buddhism.
* Ignorance (incorrect knowledge) is presented as the primary condition for rebirth in the doctrine of Conditioned Origination.

## # Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Path to Liberation

* Dharmaśreṣthin follows a path resembling Conditioned Origination, believing false views (dṛṣṭi) are the main problem.
* He distinguishes five false views and includes them in a list of ten attachments (anuśaya).
* These attachments can be eliminated through discernment (darśana) and practice (bhāvanā).

## # The Four Noble Truths and Attachments

* Dharmaśreṣṭhin connects the elimination of attachments with insight into the Four Noble Truths.
* Attachments are subdivided into ninety-eight varieties based on their objects and the three spheres of existence.
* Insight into the Four Noble Truths is also subdivided into sixteen moments of knowledge.

## # The Path to Liberation and Knowledge of Dharmas

* The path to liberation begins with the Four Applications of Mindfulness (smṛtyupasthāna).
* These applications lead to the production of wholesome roots (kuśalamūla), making liberation possible.
* Dharmaśreṣṭhin's structure suggests that knowledge of the Four Noble Truths implies knowledge of all dharmas.

## # Meditation and Stages in Dharmaśreṣṭhin's Path

* Dharmaśreṣṭhin's path to liberation does not mention meditation, including the Four Stages of Meditation (dhyāna) or stages of attainment (samāpatti).
* This is striking as these stages play a major role in his cosmology.


## # Buddhist Schools and Sects

* Buddhism has schools distinguished by doctrinal opinions and sects (nikāya) based on monastic rules.
* Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda are examples of Vinaya schools, each with its own Vinaya works.
* Pudgalavādins appear to have used Sarvāstivādin monastic rules, suggesting they were a philosophical school.

## # The Sautrāntika School

* This school primarily reacted against Sarvāstivāda.
* Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośabhāṣya mentions Sautrāntika positions alongside Sarvāstivādins.
* Key Sautrāntika doctrines include:
    * Only the present exists, denying the reality of past and future.
    * Non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) dharmas do not exist.

## # Sautrāntika Explanation of Dharma Relations


* Denying past and future required a different explanation for the relation between earlier and later dharmas.
* They proposed the existence of "seeds" (bīja).

## # 4. Mahāyāna

*  The Sarvāstivādins' systematization of dharma theory was unique compared to the Pāli school, which focused more on a path to liberation.
* The Sarvāstivādins aimed for a coherent and internally consistent doctrine that could withstand rational attacks.
* This rationalization suggests they faced intellectual challenges from those with differing viewpoints.
*  The development of this rational tradition may have been influenced by Greek culture in northwest India, where the Sarvāstivādins were active. 
* The *Milindapañha*, a text about discussions between a Greek king and a Buddhist monk, supports the idea of interaction between Buddhists and Greeks.
* This early influence led to a tradition of rationality within Buddhism, encouraging dialogue and mutual influence among different schools of thought.

## Early Mahāyāna

* The earliest Buddhist texts made no distinction between a Buddha's liberation and that of his followers. Both were called Arhats.
* Later, disagreements arose about the exact nature of an Arhat and whether they could lose their status.
* Some Buddhists felt that Arhatship was not enough and sought to achieve Buddhahood instead.

* These individuals followed the "Path of Beings Destined for Enlightenment" (Bodhisattvayāna) rather than the traditional "Path of Listeners" (Śrāvakayāna).
* This movement remained a minority for centuries, primarily supported by monks.

* The term "Mahāyāna," meaning "Great Path," was used alongside "Path of Beings Destined for Enlightenment."

* Mahāyāna emphasized the aspiration to attain perfect Buddhahood rather than simply becoming an Arhat.
* Bodhisattvas, those on the path to Buddhahood, seek not only their own liberation but also that of all beings.

* Initially, there were no doctrinal disputes between Mahāyāna and other Buddhists.
* However, Mahāyāna developed its own distinctive doctrines, often building upon existing Buddhist ideas.

* One factor contributing to these developments may have been the emphasis on spiritual practice among Mahāyāna adherents.

## The Mahāyānist Path to Liberation

* A Bodhisattva cultivates a series of qualities and practices, including the thirty-seven Dharmas Helpful to Enlightenment.
* This path is similar to that of an Arhat but longer and more complex.

* Bodhisattvas also cultivate perfections (pāramitā), initially six: giving, moral conduct, patience, energy, meditation, and wisdom.

* The perfection of wisdom was highly esteemed, particularly in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras.
* These texts emphasize the unreality of the phenomenal world, a concept also found in earlier Abhidharma Buddhism.

* The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras highlight the absurdity of the phenomenal world's existence, even questioning the reality of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas themselves.




# The Unreal Nature of the Phenomenal World

* The Mahāyāna texts often attribute great magic powers to advanced Bodhisattvas, who can modify the unreal delusion to which other beings are subject.
* This is connected with the supernatural powers cultivated before the rise of Mahāyāna, which blend more smoothly with the overall picture of reality in Mahāyāna than had been the case before.

# The Unreal Nature of Dharmas

* Mahāyāna went further than simply denying the reality of the phenomenal world by denying the reality of dharmas.
* This was a rupture of great significance because the dharma theory had practically become identical with Buddhist doctrine.
* If dharmas no longer exist, nothing is left.

# Linguistic Change and the Doctrine of Emptiness

* The change in interpretation of the word *anatt*ā (non-self) from singular substantive to plural adjective ("without self") helped the development of the doctrine of emptiness.
* This linguistic ambiguity gave direction to the development but was not the sole cause.

# Spiritual Origins of the Doctrine of Emptiness

* The tendency to deny the reality of the phenomenal world and dharmas may be linked to the state of Attainment of Cessation of Ideations and Feelings (saṃjñāvedayitanirodhasamāpatti).
* This state, characterized by the lack of ideations and sensations, may have been interpreted as indicating that ideations and sensations do not correspond to the highest reality.

# Meditation and the Doctrine of Emptiness

* The doctrine of emptiness is also linked with meditative states, particularly visualization techniques.
* These techniques were often connected with "meditation on the Buddhas," which initially had nothing to do with visualizing.




# Discourse on Concentration

* Emphasizes the unreal nature of experiences during concentration.
* Compares these experiences to dreams.
* Explains the emptiness of all dharmas.

# Visualisation Practices

* Less directly connected with the emptiness of all dharmas compared to Attainment of Cessation.
* Can lead to the conclusion that the phenomenal world is shaped by the mind and therefore unreal.
* This view is stated in the Pratyutpanna-buddha-saṃmukhāvasthita-samādhi Sūtra, which declares "This [entire world] consisting of the three spheres is mind only (cittamātra)".

# Interplay Between Doctrine and Spiritual Praxis

* Meditational experiences can be interpreted as corroborating the doctrine of emptiness.
* Doctrinal positions may have been inspired by meditational experiences or the lack thereof.
* There's a constant interplay between doctrine and spiritual praxis, with influence flowing in both directions.

# Claims of Direct Perception in Indian Religions

* In Indian religions, doctrinal positions are often claimed to be based on direct perception of reality by spiritually advanced beings.
* Yogis are supposed to directly perceive the categories and sub-categories of Brahmanical schools like Vaiśeṣika.

# Meditative Practices in Buddhism

* Meditative practices are constantly discussed and analyzed in Buddhism.
* New doctrines were likely accepted only if they could be seen as objects of experience for spiritually advanced adepts.

# Development of Emptiness Doctrine

* Liberation in early Buddhism occurred during the fourth stage of meditation, with knowledge of the Four Noble Truths leading to liberation.
* Mahāyāna Buddhism developed the doctrine of lack of self and broadened its interpretation to include the lack of self of dharmas (emptiness).
* This reinterpreted lack of self is the emptiness of the world, knowledge of which leads to the perfection of wisdom.

# Highest Existence in Prajñāpāramitā Literature

* The concept of highest existence is central, but it's ungraspable and indeterminable.
* It's often described as a spotless and luminous mind, without origin or end, uncreated and unchanging.
* Due to its unlimited nature, it's frequently likened to empty space.

# Nature of Highest Existence

* The highest existence is not touched by what happens in the phenomenal world.
* It's neither bound nor released, stained nor purified, and exercises no influence itself.
* It's often designated as "essence of the dharmas," "element of the dharmas," or "thusness."

# Apparent Contradiction

* Some texts seem to recognize a highest existence, but this impression is wrong for some.
* The highest truth is that there is no highest existence.

# Resolution of the Contradiction

* Both the phenomenal world and the so-called highest existence are ultimately unreal and have no beginning or end.
* This is illustrated by comparing them to space, which has no measure, duration, or end.




# The Lord

* They apply to them also. Also the aggregates, and also all dharmas are unthinkable. 
* For with regard to the true essential nature of form, etc., there is no thought, nor volition, nor any of the dharmas which constitute thought, nor any comparing. 
* For that reason the aggregates and all dharmas are also unthinkable and incomparable.

* They are also immeasurable, because one cannot conceive of a measure of form, etc. since such a measure does not exist, in consequence of the infinitude of all dharmas. 
* They are also incalculable, because they have risen above all possibility of counting. 
* They are also equal to the unequalled, because all dharmas are the same as space.

# Madhyamaka

* The early Mahāyāna Sūtras seem to react against the Abhidharma Buddhists' overall attempts at systematisation. However, they did not as a rule attack isolated doctrinal positions adopted by the Sarvāstivādins.
* This would not have been possible without examining these ideas in depth and dealing with them rationally. Such rational discussions were not sought by the adepts of early Mahāyāna. They preferred to dedicate themselves to religious practice rather than hair-splitting discussions.

* There was however one Mahāyāna adept who answered the Sarvāstivādins' challenge on their own terms. This was Nāgārjuna, who probably lived during the second century CE. Using the utmost skill and virtuosity, Nāgārjuna turned the Sārvāstivādins' own rationality against them.
* His major work is the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā "the Foundational Verses of the Middle Teaching", probably not yet called thus by Nāgārjuna himself. 

* We know that the Buddha's path to liberation was called "middle path" already in the old discourses. Nāgārjuna borrows the idea, but reinterprets it in his own way. As the name of a school, Madhyamaka or Mādhyamika is only attested later.
* The Foundational Verses of the Middle Teaching are not merely an attack on Sarvāstivāda doctrine. The method which they develop goes much farther, and no doubt at times it made even non-Sarvāstivādins shake their heads in wonder.

* Nāgārjuna did not merely assert that the phenomenal world does not exist, but he actually managed to prove it. 
* Nāgārjuna thus belongs to those thinkers, of whom there are also examples in ancient Greece and China, who put the new instrument of logic to this use. We must remember, however, that most Buddhists of Nāgārjuna's time were a priori convinced of the outcome of his arguments that the effect of Nāgārjuna's method was to prove that their conception of the world, i.e., their dharma theory, could not be correct either.

* A proof that shows that the phenomenal world does not exist should interest everyone who is interested in philosophy, even non-Buddhists, and indeed, these latter were not slow to react. 
* We shall however concentrate on some of the arguments which mainly concern Abhidharma Buddhism. We shall soon discover that even when Nāgārjuna attacks doctrines which are specific to these Buddhists, the scope of his argumentation goes well beyond these doctrines.

* In order to grasp many of Nāgārjuna's arguments, we must note the following. Nāgārjuna's starting point, which he shared with most Buddhists of his time, was the conviction that the objects of the phenomenal world are somehow conditioned by words.
* We have already discussed this understanding of the relation between words and things while dealing with the arrangement of the doctrine in the early centuries following the Buddha's demise. This belief was the common property of most Buddhists at that time.

* Nāgārjuna did not feel compelled to go against it. On the contrary, his new method consisted in using this belief - or better, this conviction - in a new fashion. In so doing, however, he did not, like most Buddhists before him, limit its scope to isolated words: he also took propositions into consideration.
* His premise was that the words which occur in a proposition each correspond to an object or event in the situation described by it. As a matter of fact, this is often the case. For instance, the proposition "Nāgārjuna reads a book" describes a situation in which there is a book, Nāgārjuna, and the activity of reading.

* But there are other propositions in which such a direct connection with the phenomenal world is difficult to maintain. An example is the proposition "Nāgārjuna writes a book". This proposition describes a situation in which Nāgārjuna and the activity of writing have their place. But the book is not yet there; it will be there when the writing is over.
* Faced with this difficulty, one might conclude that the hypothesis according to which the words in a proposition correspond to objects or events in the situation described is not correct.

* For Nāgārjuna, this conclusion was unimaginable. For him, difficulties like this were merely proof that the phenomenal world does not really exist. Like other Buddhists, he knew this beforehand. Contradictions of this kind only showed that the unreality of the phenomenal world could now also be proved.


# How can this non-arisen origination (utpāda) produce itself?

* If something arises from having arisen, then what is produced again?
* Neither the presently arising, nor what has arisen, nor what has not arisen, arises in any way.

# In this last verse, Nāgārjuna refers to an argument which he had exposed in an earlier chapter.

* This is indeed one of his favourite arguments. 
* It frequently recurs in his verses.

# A central element in Nāgārjuna's reasoning is tersely expressed in verse 17:

* If something that has not arisen exists somewhere, it could arise.
* Since no such thing exists, what arises?

#  Nāgārjuna then submits the two remaining characteristics of the conditioned to a similar and equally destructive analysis.

* He concludes the chapter with the following two verses:
    * Since origination, duration and destruction are not established, the conditioned (saṃskṛta) does not exist. 
    * Given that the conditioned is not established, how will the non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) be established?

# Origination, endurance and destruction have been declared to be like an illusion, like a dream, like a city of the *gandharvas*.


* This conclusion clearly shows what remains of Sārvāstivāda ontology in the hands of Nāgārjuna.
* Not only do the three (or four) dharmas known as the characteristics of the conditioned turn out to be unprovable or even non-existent. 
* All the conditioned (saṃskṛta) and non-conditioned (asaṃskṛta) dharmas undergo the same fate.

# In order to understand Nāgārjuna's method of analysis better, let us look more closely at verse 17.

* Here Nāgārjuna declares: If something that has not arisen exists somewhere, it could arise. Since no such thing exists, what arises?
* The problem becomes clearer once we apply this question to a concrete example.

# As we have noticed earlier, Nāgārjuna bases himself on propositions in order to draw conclusions about the phenomenal world.

* This can lead to impossible and contradictory situations. 
* These problematic propositions show that the phenomenal world does not really exist.


# Nāgārjuna pushes this method of argumentation further, and in doing so does not spare the Abhidharma Buddhists.

* He shows that their explanation of the phenomenal world, too, is untenable. 
* The existence of dharmas is no more defendable than that of pots and similar things.

# In the above translated verse 7.14, Nāgārjuna refers to an argument which concerns the paths which are presently being traveled, those which have been traveled, and those which have not been traveled.


* Consider the following verses:
    * If there were a traveling of [a road] that is being traveled, there would be two [acts of] traveling: the [traveling] by which that [road] is being traveled, and again that traveling on it. 
    * If there were two [acts of] traveling, there would be two travelers. For there can be no traveling without a traveler.

# We shall not examine Nāgārjuna's subsequent verses. These two are enough to show that here, too, Nāgārjuna bases himself on a verbal expression, namely: "The road presently being traveled is being traveled."

* In this proposition, the verb "to travel" is used twice, and this is enough for Nāgārjuna to conclude that there must be two acts of traveling.
* As in the proposition "the pot comes into existence", here too, Nāgārjuna does not distinguish between language and the phenomenal world.

# It appears that for Nāgārjuna the case of the road which is being traveled served as an example for others.

* He refers to it in the discussion of the characteristics of the conditioned, as we have seen.
* He does the same elsewhere, for example in the third chapter where he discusses the Buddhist doctrine of perception, which, too, is shown to be untenable.


# We have noted above that this doctrine is an important part of the dharma theory.

* For it is causality which connects the momentary dharmas that are produced one after the other, and which conditions their production.
* The Sarvāstivādins had made a distinction between different sorts of conditions (*pratyaya*): the producing condition (*hetu-pratyaya*); the support (ā*ramba*ṇa- or ā*lambana-pratyaya*) or object of knowledge; the immediately contiguous condition (*samanantara-pratyaya*); and the determining condition (*adhipati-pratyaya*).

# Nāgārjuna then proceeds to demolish the idea of cause and effect:


* Activity is not constituted of conditions (*pratyaya*) nor is it not constituted of conditions.
* Conditions are neither constituted nor not constituted of activity. 
* These are conditions, because depending upon them these [others] arise. So long as these [others] do not arise, why are they not non-conditions?

# Since a thing that is existent or non-existent or both existent and nonexistent does not produce, how could there be, such being the case, a producing condition?


* It is easy to show that Nāgārjuna's logic, here as well as in the examples discussed above, is mostly false.
* This observation, though correct, does not do sufficient justice to Nāgārjuna's presuppositions.

# For him - as we have already noted above - language plays a decisive role in interpreting the phenomenal world.


* Language says that a cause needs an effect, and vice versa. However, cause and effect do not exist at the same time.
* When a cause exists, its effect does not exist. And once the effect is there, its cause often exists no longer. How then can they be dependent on each other?

# In order to convince Nāgārjuna that his conclusions are false, one should not teach him a better logic, but a different world-view.

* Given his presuppositions, most of his arguments are faultless from a logical point of view.
* After this overall criticism, it is easy for Nāgārjuna to prove in the verses that follow that the four types of conditions mentioned above are untenable. 
* Here again, he reaches the conclusion that coming into being is not really possible.

# In the first verses of the nineteenth chapter, Nāgārjuna uses the same type of argument to prove that time does not exist:


* If the present and the future depend upon the past, then the present and the future will be in the past time.
* Again, if the present and the future do not exist therein [i.e., in the past], how could the present and the future depend upon it?

# In the fifteenth chapter, Nāgārjuna deals with another notion we have met before, namely, the Sarvāstivādins' concept of the dharmas' "own nature" (*svabh*āva).


* This is supposed to be eternal and beyond the scope of time. According to Nāgārjuna, such an "own nature" stands in contradiction with causal dependence.
* He states: The occurrence of the own nature through causes and conditions is not proper. An own nature that has occurred as a result of causes and conditions would be something that is made.

# In the absence of an own nature (*svabh*āva), whence can there be another nature (*parabh*āva*)?


* For the own nature of another nature is called another nature.
* How can there be something that is without own nature and other nature? For something is established only when there is own nature and other nature.

# While reading this passage, it is important to keep in mind that only that which "exists" in the highest sense of the term can be or have an own nature.


* We have already seen that whatever has originated from causes or conditions does not really exist.
* It is therefore not surprising to see that Nāgārjuna starts from the premise that if things were to possess an own nature, they would have to be without origin.

# We have already touched upon Nāgārjuna's position on causality, but without mentioning the doctrine of Conditioned Origination.


* This doctrine is of the highest interest to him. For Nāgārjuna, it is proof that the dharmas cannot really exist.
* For this doctrine connects the dharmas with each other, and shows their mutual dependence.

# We have seen that for Nāgārjuna dependence implies simultaneity.


* However, the dharmas arise one after the other, and this gives rise to a contradiction from which Nāgārjuna concludes that all the dharmas are empty, i.e., without real existence:
    * We state that Conditioned Origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path.



# Conditioned Origination and Emptiness

* For Nāgārjuna, Conditioned Origination is emptiness because there are no dharmas (due to their emptiness).
* This aligns with the Sarvāstivādins' view that Conditioned Origination is the conditioned dharmas.
* Ultimately, nothing exists in highest reality for Nāgārjuna.

# The Problem of the Self

* Nāgārjuna follows the Buddhist tradition of rejecting a permanent self, similar to the Upanishadic concept.
* Knowledge of non-self plays a crucial role in achieving liberation.
* He agrees with the idea that composite things do not truly exist.

# Person and Pudgalavāda

* The concept of a person as a collection of dharmas is central to the Pudgalavādins, who believed in the reality of the phenomenal world.
* Nāgārjuna, on the other hand, negates the phenomenal world, seeing it as empty.
* Despite their differences, both start from premises about the relationship between the person and aggregates.

# Liberation through Emptiness

* Nāgārjuna argues that clinging (upādāna) ends when views pertaining to "mine" and "I" cease.
* This cessation of clinging leads to the end of birth.
* Liberation arises from the cessation of actions and defilements, which stem from representations and false imagining.
* These stop in emptiness.

# The Role of Truth

* Nāgārjuna distinguishes between limited truth (saṃvṛtisatya) and highest truth (paramārthasatya).
* The phenomenal world exists only in a limited sense, while the Buddha's teaching and liberation have limited reality as well.
* These are necessary for reaching Nirvāṇa.

# Nāgārjuna's Arguments

* While some of his arguments may not be logically convincing, many are logically sound.
* The main weakness lies in the premises concerning the relationship between words and things.

# Influence on Later Thinkers

* Nāgārjuna's influence on later Indian thinkers requires further study.
* His impact on the Sarvāstivādins is unclear, as no explicit response to his criticism has survived.

# Further Developments in Mahāyāna

* The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and Madhyamaka represent a culmination of the negation of the phenomenal world.
* However, Mahāyāna Buddhism encompasses diverse views and doctrines beyond this framework.

# Emptying the World

* The concept of "emptying" the world is central to Mahāyāna Buddhism.
* Some Mahāyāna Sūtras describe the Buddha's teachings being proclaimed in three stages, with the second and third stages being unclear and open to interpretation.
* This suggests an awareness of different developments within Mahāyāna, some independent of the idea of emptiness.

# The Concept of Dharmakāya

* "Dharmakāya" originally referred to the Buddha's teachings as his embodiment.
* Later, it was used substantively with multiple meanings, including "collection of teachings," "collection of mental properties," and eventually "totality of dharmas."
* In some Sūtras, dharmakāya is seen as a real entity, encompassing all good qualities of a perfected being.

# Tathāgatagarbha and Dharmakāya

* The Tathāgatagarbha ("Buddha-embryo") concept arose from the idea that all beings inherently possess Buddhahood, veiled by impurities.
* When these impurities are removed, the Tathāgatagarbha becomes the dharmakāya, representing fully realized Buddhahood.
* Both concepts are considered identical and real, contradicting the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness.

# Yogācāra School

* Yogācāra means "activity of yoga" or "yogin," referring to spiritual practice.
* The school likely drew influence from non-Buddhist yogic traditions.
* Yogācāra is rooted in both Mahāyāna and pre-Mahāyāna Buddhism, incorporating ideas from both.

# Ālayavijñāna

* Ālayavijñāna ("Fundamental Consciousness") plays a crucial role in Mahāyāna.
* It may have originated as an attempt to explain how consciousness returns after the Attainment of Cessation (nirodhasamāpatti), where there is no ideation or feeling.




# Past

* Yogācāra did not accept the existence of the past.
* For them, mental dharmas can directly bring forth new dharmas despite the distance in time.

# Question

* How is consciousness possible in the Attainment of Cessation?

# Answer

* Ālayavijñāna has not ceased to be present in the material sense-faculties.
* It comprises seeds of future forms of mind, so they are bound to re-arise after emerging from this attainment.
* This explains how one survives a sojourn in the Attainment of Cessation and obtains consciousness again.

# The Concept of Ālayavijñāna

* The problem solved by postulating the Ālayavijñāna has nothing to do with specifically Mahāyānist concerns.
* It is possible that this concept had existed for a long time in non-Mahāyāna circles before it was adopted into Mahāyāna.
* Later, the Ālayavijñāna came to be considered:
    * The individual substratum of the cycle of rebirths (saṃsāra), and even of liberation.
    * A link between actions and their effects.
    * The bearer of impressions (vāsanā) and seeds (bīja).

# Ālayavijñāna and the Notion of Self

* The enumeration of functions shows how close the later Ālayavijñāna came to the notion of a self.
* By rejecting the self, Buddhism created a problem that kept cropping up in various ways throughout its history.

# Mind-Only Doctrine (Cittamātra)

* This doctrine states that any cognition or perception has as object an image that exists in cognition itself, not a real object that exists outside cognition.
* Knowledge is "mind-only" or "making-known only"; no corresponding external object is cognised.
* The existence of the external world could easily be reconciled with the manifold series of individual consciousnesses accepted in the texts.

# Origin of Mind-Only Doctrine

* Schmithausen emphasized and tried to prove its connection with the practice of meditation, especially with the spiritual technique of visualizing.

# Yogācāra Doctrine

* The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra claims that the images which are made the objects of contemplation are not different from the mind.
* It uses a saying of the Buddha as proof of the ideal, i.e., not objectively real, nature of the objects of contemplation.
* This doctrine could also be explained differently:

# Doctrine of Mere Designation (Prajñaptimātra)

* This doctrine states that the objects of the phenomenal world are nothing but designations or denominations.
* The Yogācāra doctrine shares elements with this doctrine, and it cannot be ruled out that the former arose from the latter.


# Rejection of Person

* The rejection of the person was a perpetual source of problems in Buddhism.
* For instance: how can the dharmas of one person be distinguished from those of another? How can the continuity of a person be explained if there is no person?

# Solutions to Problems

* The Sarvāstivādins tried to solve this problem. Later Yogācāra used the Ālayavijñāna as a connection between actions and their results.
* Buddhists cultivated the notion of a "series" or "uninterrupted succession" (saṃtāna).
* The "uninterrupted succession of mind" (citta-saṃtati or -saṃtāna) often played the role of "pseudo-self".

# Actions and Their Fruits

* Only the fruits of actions posed a problem, for they are not always mental.
* The *Abhidharmako*śa makes the general statement that the diversity of the world is produced by actions.

# Mind-Only Explanation

* It would be vain to try to choose between these explanations. They probably supported and strengthened each other.

# Doctrine of Triple Nature


* This doctrine starts from the two truths, limited truth (saṃvṛtisatya) and highest truth (paramārthasatya).
* Limited truth is conditioned by language. In Yogācāra, there is one more level between this truth and the highest truth.

# Three Levels of Reality

* The imagined (*parikalpita*) nature or characteristic of things: unreal because the doctrine of "making-known only" (vijñaptimātra) recognizes no objects outside ourselves.
* The dependent (*paratantra*) nature or characteristic of things: this is not the highest truth, which Yogācāras call the perfected (pariniṣpanna) nature or characteristic of things.



# The Doctrine of the Triple Constitution of Things

* The dharmas have three characteristics: imagined, dependent, and perfected.
* The imagined characteristic is the establishment of names and conventions for dharmas in everyday language.
* The dependent characteristic is the dependent origination of dharmas, arising from ignorance and conditioned factors.
* The perfected characteristic is the thusness of dharmas, realized by Bodhisattvas through correct observation and practice.

# Imagined Characteristic and Dependent Characteristic

* The imagined characteristic can be compared to the mistaken perception of a clear crystal as a gemstone.
* Just as the crystal itself is not truly a gemstone, the dependent characteristic is not truly the imagined characteristic.
* The perfected characteristic is realized when the dependent characteristic is seen through its illusory nature.

#  Concepts in Yogacara

* Fundamental consciousness, the act of making-known only, and the triple nature of things are essential concepts in classical Yogācāra.
* The Yogācāra school interprets Dharmakāya differently from the Tathāgatagarbha school.

# Dharmakaya

* The Dharmakāya is eternal, inconceivable, neither existing nor non-existing, neither conditioned nor unconditioned.
* It is reached through knowledge free from representations and serves as the support for the Buddha's bodies of enjoyment and magical transformation. 


## The Logico-Epistemological School

* This section discusses Buddhist teachings on the nature of reality and how they evolved over time.
* Early Buddhists denied the reality of the phenomenal world, believing only dharmas truly existed.
* Some Mahāyānist thinkers questioned even the existence of dharmas, claiming nothing exists at all or that reality is mind-only.

## Dignāga's Contribution

* Dignāga (around 6th century) combined various Buddhist threads into a coherent system in his work *Pramanasamuccaya*.
* He did not deny external reality but saw it as the object of perception, completely indescribable and free from representations.

## The Two Realms of Reality

* Dignāga distinguished between two realms: the realm of the "own characteristic" (external reality) and the realm of the "general characteristic" (reality described by words).
* These realms are distinct and do not overlap.

## Dignāga's Solution to Nāgārjuna's Challenge

* Dignāga addressed Nāgārjuna's arguments against language-conditioned reality through his *apoha* theory.
* This theory posits that words designate things through exclusion, explaining how expressions like "white lotus" can be used without designating separate objects for each word.
* The *apoha* theory established a hierarchy among words and the things they represent, creating a structured world conditioned by language.

## Dignāga's Structure of Reality

* Dignāga's structure of reality resembles the Vaiśeṣika system, dividing the existent into substances, properties, and activities.
* This reflects the influence of Sanskrit grammar on both systems.

## Summary of Dignāga's View

* Dignāga maintains the traditional Buddhist distinction between highest reality (accessible through perception) and apparent reality (conditioned by language).
* Both realms are coherent within themselves, with highest reality being free from contradictions due to its ineffability.





# 5. Final Observations

* This section acknowledges that the presentation of Buddhist teaching in India is not exhaustive and many thinkers and ideas are not dealt with.
* It briefly mentions Tantric Buddhism (Mantrayāna or Vajrayāna) as a third Vehicle, distinct from Śrāvakayāna and Mahāyāna, characterized by its use of magical formulas and rites.
* It highlights the continuity between Tantric Buddhism and earlier forms, pointing to the role of magical power in Mahāyāna and the idea that the true nature of phenomena is illusory.

# 1. Hermeneutics

* This section explores how Buddhists explained the diversity of teachings attributed to the Buddha despite their claim to be based on his words.
* It discusses the development of hermeneutics, a method of interpretation, driven by the need to understand the Buddha's words correctly.
* The role of councils in establishing the Buddha's words through common recitation is mentioned, along with disagreements about which texts were authentic.
* The section examines rules for examining the authenticity of texts and the concept of "skill in means" (upāyakauśalya) to explain why the Buddha might have expressed himself in ways requiring interpretation.
* It highlights the use of "skill in means" by a Buddha to encourage people towards enlightenment, tailoring their teachings to individual needs.
* The parable of the burning house from the Lotus Sūtra is used to illustrate this concept, with Mahāyāna being presented as the ultimate Vehicle. 




## 2. Influences Outside Buddhism

* Indian Buddhism was influenced by non-Buddhist religious and intellectual currents.
* Early Buddhism was influenced by Jainism and the idea that knowledge of the self is essential for liberation.
* The Sarvāstivāda school may have been influenced by Greek culture, especially its tradition of debate.
* Buddhism itself exerted influence on other movements in India, including Brahmanical philosophies and yoga.

## Influences of Buddhism on Other Movements

*  Buddhist influence can be seen in the Mahābhārata, with references to Buddhist concepts like the four characteristics of the conditioned and the goal of Nirvāṇa.
* Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya, a Brahmanical commentary on grammar, shows possible influence from Sarvāstivāda thought, particularly regarding the nature of language and sound.

## Influence of Buddhism on Vaiśeṣika

* The Vaiśeṣika system, while distinct from Buddhism, shares similarities with it, suggesting a possible reaction against Buddhist ideas.
* Both systems have attempted to provide an exhaustive enumeration of reality, although their lists differ due to differing views on composite objects.
*  Both systems also share concepts like atomism and momentariness, particularly in the treatment of mental events.

# The Influence of Nāgārjuna on Other Indian Philosophical Systems

* Sarvāstivāda was immune to Nāgārjuna's main attacks because it held that objects already exist before they come into being.
* A similar doctrine is found in the Brahmanical system called Sāṃkhya, known as "doctrine of the effect (kārya) already existing (sat) in the cause" (satkāryavāda).
* This doctrine appeared relatively late and may have been influenced by discussions with Mādhyamika Buddhists.

# The Influence of Buddhism on Brahmanical Systems

* From the time of Nāgārjuna onward, texts belonging to various systems began to discuss the opinions of others, leading to increased influence between schools.
* A good example is the development of logic, which came into existence as a result of the constant exchange of ideas, mainly between Buddhist and Brahmanical thinkers.

# The Influence of Mahāyāna Buddhism on Vedānta Philosophy

* Bhartṛhari's thought betrays the influence of Buddhism in its premise that there is a close correspondence between words and things.
* Like Buddhists, Bhartṛhari believed that the phenomenal world ultimately does not exist.
* The Āgamaśāstra, attributed to Gauḍapāda, shows clear influence from Mahāyāna Buddhism, particularly in its thesis of the non-production of the phenomenal world.

# The Influence of Buddhism on Śaṅkara

* It is unclear to what extent Śaṅkara was influenced by Buddhism, although other Vedāntins accused him of being a crypto-Buddhist.
* His connection with Gauḍapāda suggests possible indirect influence through this figure or other authors.

# The Influence of Buddhism on Yoga

* Buddhist influence on yoga can be seen in the Mahābhārata and in classical yoga, which developed from pre-classical yoga by incorporating ideas and practices from Buddhism.
* Buddhism contributed to classical yoga by emphasizing the destruction of mental impurities as a path to liberation, alongside physical and mental immobility.
* The Yoga Sūtra contains parallels to Buddhist practice and theory, such as the Four Concentrations, the Four Unmeasurables, and the Five Faculties or Strengths.

# Landmarks in the Development of Indian Buddhism

* Buddhism originated within the Śramaṇa movement and shared characteristics with other currents but differed in its understanding of actions and methods for liberation.
* The doctrine of non-self developed into a fundamental dogma, leading to the denial of composite things and the development of dharma theory as an ontology.
* Reflections on the relationship between words and things arose from the belief in the non-existence of composite things, culminating in Nāgārjuna's assertion that phenomenal reality does not exist.
* A tradition of rationality emerged within Buddhism, characterized by a willingness to engage in discussions with those who hold different views.
* Buddhist thinkers maintained a constant interest in religious practice, which often conditioned their conception of reality.
