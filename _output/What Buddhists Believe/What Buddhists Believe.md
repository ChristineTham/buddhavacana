# PART ONE - LIFE AND MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA




### 1. Life And Nature Of The Buddha

* Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived in Northern India in the 6th century B.C.
* He was born a prince named Siddhartha Gautama and led a luxurious life.
* Witnessing the 'Four Sights' (an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a holy recluse) made him realize the inevitability of suffering and death.

* Inspired by the recluse, he decided to renounce his worldly possessions and seek enlightenment.
* At 29, he left his palace, wife, and newborn son to become an ascetic.

* For six years, he practiced severe austerities but realized they were futile.
* He attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at Gaya at the age of 35.

#### His Renunciation

* Prince Siddhartha renounced his life of luxury at the age of 29 to seek enlightenment.

* Despite the temptation to stay, he felt compelled to leave and pursue the truth.
* He quietly departed without a formal farewell to avoid emotional turmoil and potential opposition from his family.
* His wife, Yasodhara, understood his purpose and later chose to follow a simpler life as a mark of respect.

# The Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha

* Prince Siddhartha renounced worldly pleasures at a young age for the sake of suffering humanity. 
* Detachment is crucial for attaining Enlightenment, as attachment causes unhappiness and prevents us from finding Truth.
* Prince Siddhartha's sacrifice allowed him to discover the remedy for human suffering.

# Nature Of The Buddha

* The Buddha brought light and understanding to a world shrouded in darkness and ignorance.
* His teachings were revolutionary and attracted people from all walks of life.
* He emphasized self-reliance, mental purification, and the pursuit of inner peace.

# Was Buddha An Incarnation Of God?

* The Buddha never claimed to be a god or messenger of any deity.
* He was a self-enlightened being who achieved perfection through his own efforts.
* Buddhists believe anyone can become a Buddha by developing their qualities and removing ignorance.

# Some People Have Already Started To Erect The Image Of The Future Buddha

* Some people have started erecting images and worshipping a future Buddha based on their own imagination.

# The Buddha'S Service

* The Buddha dispelled ignorance and showed the world how to be free from suffering.
* He embodied all the virtues he preached and translated his words into actions.
* His moral code is the most perfect in history.
* Millions have found inspiration in his teachings for over 25 centuries.
* He was among the first religious leaders to admonish against animal sacrifice.
* He did not want blind faith, but followers who could think freely and work out their own salvation.

# Historical Evidences Of The Buddha

* Gautama the Buddha is a historical figure, not mythical.
* Evidence of his existence comes from:
    * Testimonies from those who knew him.
    * Discovery of places and buildings mentioned in narratives.
    * The unbroken existence of the Sangha (holy order).
    * Conventions and councils held to verify his teachings.
    * Relics enshrined in pagodas.
    * Historical records like 'The Mahavamsa'.
    * Records from Buddhist countries that received Buddhism centuries after his death.
    * The Tripitaka, a record of his 45 years of teaching.

# Salvation Through Arahantahood

* Attaining Nirvana through Arahantahood is not selfish.
* The Buddha never said he wanted to save everyone in the universe.
* He offered help only to those spiritually mature and willing to accept his teachings.
* Each person must make the effort to train and purify themselves for salvation.
* It's impractical to think everyone must become a Buddha to attain salvation, just like it's impractical for everyone to become a doctor to cure themselves.

# Attaining Arahantship

* To become an Arahant, one must eliminate greed and selfishness.
* An Arahant acts compassionately towards others and inspires them to seek liberation.
* They serve as living proof of the benefits of following the Buddha's teachings.
* Achieving Nirvana is impossible with selfish motives, so striving for Arahantship isn't selfish.

# The Three Ideals

* Buddhahood is the highest ideal, but not everyone can achieve it.
* Just like not everyone can be a genius scientist, there are different levels of spiritual attainment.
* Arahantas share the Dharma to help others find salvation.

# Who Is A Bodhisattva?

* A Bodhisattva is dedicated to Enlightenment and destined to become a Buddha.
* They cultivate transcendental virtues (Paramis) with compassion and wisdom.
* Their goal is to alleviate suffering for all beings, even at the cost of their own life.
* In Pali scriptures, Prince Siddhartha was called a Bodhisattva before his Enlightenment.

# Theravada vs. Mahayana Views on Bodhisattvas

* Theravada Buddhists respect Bodhisattvas but don't see them as saviors who can enlighten others before achieving their own enlightenment.
* They believe everyone must follow the Buddha's path and personally eradicate defilements to attain Nirvana.
* While Theravada Buddhism acknowledges some Buddhas, it doesn't emphasize historical figures or the concept of Pure Land where Bodhisattvas wait for devotees.

# Attainment Of Buddhahood

* Becoming a Buddha is the most challenging achievement possible.
* Anyone can become a Buddha, unlike other religions where only founders attain the highest state.
* It requires immense effort, self-discipline, and countless lifetimes of purifying the mind.
* The Buddha attained Enlightenment through his own efforts, not by relying on supernatural beings.

# Trikaya - The Three Bodies Of The Buddha

* Mahayana philosophy describes three "bodies" (trikaya) of the Buddha: Dharma-kaya, Sambhoga-kaya, and Nirmana-kaya.
* Dharma-kaya is the Truth body, representing the essence of Enlightenment.
* Sambhoga-kaya is the Enjoyment body, associated with bliss and spiritual rewards.
* Nirmana-kaya is the Manifestation body, the physical form a Buddha takes to teach.

# The Buddha's Bodies

* In the Buddha's lifetime, both the *Nirmana-kaya* (Manifestation-body) and the Dharma-kaya (Dharma-body) were united in Him.
* After His Parinirvana, the distinction became more pronounced.
* His Manifestation-body died after cremation was enshrined in the form of relics in stupas.
* His Dharma-body is eternally present.

* The Mahayana philosophy developed the '*Sambhoga-kaya',* the Enjoyment-of—Bliss-body.
* This body is through which the Buddha rejoiced in the Dharma, teaching the Truth, leading others to the realisation of the Truth, and enjoying the company of good people.
* Though not mentioned in Theravada texts, it can be appreciated without contradiction if understood in this context.

* The Enjoyment-body or Body of Bliss is represented as a person, though not a human historical person.

* Although terms *Sambhoga-kaya* and *Dharma-kaya* found in later Pali works come from Mahayana and semi-Mahayana works, scholars from other traditions did not show hostility towards them.
* Venerable Buddhaghosa referred to the bodies of the Buddha thus: 'The Buddha is possessed of a beautiful *rupakaya* adorned with eighty minor and thirty-two major signs of a great man, and possessed of a *Dharma-kaya* purified in every way and glorified by Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, full of splendour and virtue, incomparable and fully enlightened.'

# 2. His Message

* Buddha's message remains relevant to the needs of today's society because He considered Himself as a *human* religious teacher whose message was meant to promote freedom, happiness and wellbeing of others.
* The Buddha's primary concern was to help His followers to live a normal life without going to extremes.

* Not everyone is expected to attain exactly the same goal in one lifetime since mental impurities are rooted differently in individuals.

* Even now does the soothing voice of the Buddha ring in our ears, and we sometimes feel ashamed because we do not understand Him fully.
* His message is for all.

* The reason that His Teachings have captured millions of hearts is because they were introduced not by weapons or political power but by love and compassion for humanity.

* During the last 25 centuries since the appearance of the Buddha, many changes have taken place in this world.
* Kingdoms have risen and fallen; nations have prospered and perished.
* The name of the Buddha remains alive and fresh in the minds of millions of people today.

* The Buddha taught that the greatest of conquests was not the subjugation of others but of the self.

* Perhaps the best example of how the gentle message of the Compassionate One could rehabilitate the most savage of men is the case of the Emperor Asoka.
* He waged fierce battles across India and caused great anguish and fear, but when he embraced the Dharma, he regretted the evil that he had done.

* The Emperor Asoka's conversion from cruelty to kindness was so complete that he forbade even the killing of animals in his kingdom.

* The Buddha's Teachings were introduced in order that societies could be cultured and civilized and live in peace and harmony.
* All of life's most difficult problems can be better understood if we but try to learn and practise His teachings.

* The Buddha was the greatest conqueror the world has ever seen. He conquered the world with His infallible weapons of love and truth.

# Miraculous Power

* In every religion, miracles are performed by either the founders or their disciples.
* In the case of the Buddha, miracles occurred from the day of His birth until His passing away into *Nirvana.*

* Many of the psychic powers of the Buddha were attained through His long and intense training in meditation.

* Using meditation on the night of His Enlightenment, there arose within the Buddha a vision of His previous births.
* He saw the whole universe as a system of Karma and Rebirth.
* Finally, He understood the nature of Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering and the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering.

* The Buddha had a natural birth; He lived in a normal way. But He was an extraordinary man, as far as His Enlightenment was concerned.


* There is no need to show His greatness by introducing miraculous powers. Miracles have little relation to seeing things as they are.
* The Buddha knew of the power that could be developed by training the human mind.

* He advised his disciples not to exercise such psychic power in order to convert less intelligent people.

* The Buddha appealed to their reasoning power when drawing people to listen to the Dharma.




## The Buddha's Teachings on Miracles

* **Miraculous Powers vs. Spiritual Power:** The Buddha teaches that spiritual power is more important than miraculous powers. While miraculous powers can be gained without spiritual development, they are dangerous if misused. True miracles arise from understanding Dharma and transforming one's life for the better.
* **The Buddha's Silence:** When faced with metaphysical or speculative questions, the Buddha often remained silent. This was because these questions were either beyond human comprehension or irrelevant to spiritual development. He prioritized practical teachings that could lead to liberation.

## How To Answer Questions

* The Buddha outlined different ways to answer questions depending on their nature:
    * **Definite answers:** Questions requiring a simple "yes" or "no."
    * **Analytical answers:** Questions requiring deeper analysis and explanation.
    * **Counter questions:** Questions prompting further reflection by the questioner.
    * **Questions to be dropped:** Speculative questions that lead to confusion and have no practical value.

## The Buddha'S Attitude Towards Worldly Knowledge

* While worldly knowledge is useful for material progress, it cannot solve human problems or bring lasting happiness. 
* Buddhism focuses on spiritual development and liberation from suffering through wisdom and mental culture.
* The Buddha emphasized the futility of pursuing knowledge about things that do not contribute to spiritual well-being.

## The Last Message Of The Buddha

* Before his passing, the Buddha urged his disciples to cherish and practice his teachings. 
* He stressed the importance of mindfulness, virtue, and tireless pursuit of the Dharma for liberation from suffering.

# When Ananda Asked The Buddha What Would Become Of The Order After He Passed Away

* The Buddha told Ananda that the Order should look to his teachings and disciplinary code as their master after he was gone.
* He warned against anyone thinking they should lead the brotherhood, stating that he had reached the end of his days and the Order should be self-reliant.
* He encouraged them to be a lamp and refuge unto themselves, seeking no other refuge.

# 3. After The Buddha

* The Buddha passed away at the age of eighty on his birthday without displaying any supernatural powers.
* A disciple remarked that all beings must depart and shed their compounded forms, even a Master like the Buddha.
* The Mahaparinirvana Sutta emphasizes diligence as component things are impermanent.

# Does The Buddha Exist After His Death?

* This question was posed to the Buddha during his lifetime and again after his death.
* The Buddha explained through a dialogue with Anuradha that all forms, feelings, perceptions, formative tendencies, and consciousness are impermanent and should not be clung to as "self."
* By understanding this impermanence, one can become disenchanted with these things, control passion, discard them, and ultimately achieve emancipation.

# A Successor To The Buddha

* Many people wonder why the Buddha did not appoint a successor.
*  The Buddha believed that attaining Buddhahood is the highest achievement requiring supreme wisdom and effort.
* Appointing a successor could lead to misuse of authority or distortion of the teachings, as only someone who has reached enlightenment can truly understand and teach them.

# The Future Buddha

* The Buddha stated that he was not the first nor the last Buddha to come to Earth.
* He predicted the arrival of Maitreya Buddha in due time, a Holy One who will reveal the same Eternal Truths.
* Buddhists believe those who lead a religious life now will have a chance to be reborn during Maitreya's time and attain Nirvana.

### 4. Timeless Truth Of The Buddha

* After hearing the Buddha, many decided to give up the wrong views they previously held regarding their religious way of life.
* BUDDHISM is a beautiful gem of many facets, attracting people of diverse personalities. Every facet in this gem has time tested methods and approaches that can benefit the Truth seekers with their various levels of understanding and spiritual maturity.

#### The Lion'S Roar

* The Buddha Dharma is the fruit resulting from a most intensive search conducted over a long period of time by a compassionate noble man whose mission was to help suffering humanity.
* Despite being surrounded by all the wealth and luxuries normally showered on a crown prince, He renounced His luxurious life and voluntarily embarked on a tough journey to seek the Truth and to find a panacea to cure the sickness of the worldly life with its attendant suffering and unsatisfactoriness.

#### What Is Buddhism?

* Buddhism is too vast and too profound to be neatly placed in any single mundane category.
* The categories or labels given to Buddhism are like signboards that indicate the contents of what is available.

##### Impact Of Buddhism On Civilization

* Today Buddhism remains as a great civilizing force in the modern world.
* As a civilizing force, Buddhism awakens the self-respect and feeling of self-responsibility of countless people and stirs up the energy of many a nation.

# Today, Buddhism appeals to the West because it has no dogmas, and it satisfies both the reason and the heart alike.

* It insists on self-reliance coupled with tolerance for others.
* It embraces modern scientific discoveries if they are for constructive purposes.
* Buddhism points to man alone as the creator of his present life and as the sole designer of his own destiny.

# The Buddha's message of peace and compassion radiated in all directions and the millions who came under its influence adopted it very readily as a new way of religious life.


# Buddhist Contribution To Humanity

* Buddhism has served the hopes and aspirations of humanity well;
* It has fostered within the social organism a commendable way of life and a communal spirit marked by endeavours towards peace and contentment.
* It has been in the forefront of human welfare.
* Even in politics it was acknowledged on many occasions as a significant break-through in fair treatment, democratic procedures and regard for basic, moral values.

* Buddhism has given a distinct flavour to the cultures of the Orient.
* Buddhism has supplied fine and ethical basic attitudes amongst the people who adopted it in one form or another.

# The Ultimate Truth

* Buddhism recognizes two kinds of Truth, the apparent conventional truth concerning mundane matters and the real or ultimate Truth concerning the supramundane.
* The ultimate Truth can be realized only by developing the mind through meditation, and not by theorising or speculation.
* The Buddha's Teaching is about the Ultimate Truth regarding the world.

* Buddhism is not a revealed or an organised religion. It is the first example of the purely scientific approach applied to questions concerning the ultimate nature of existence.
* This timeless Teaching was discovered by the Buddha Himself without the help of any divine agency.

# Two Main Schools Of Buddhism

* A few hundred years after the Buddha's passing away, there arose eighteen different schools or sects all of which claimed to represent the original Teachings of the Buddha.
* The differences between these schools were basically due to various interpretations of the Teachings of the Buddha. Over a period of time, these schools gradually merged into two main schools: Theravada and Mahayana.

* Today, the majority of the followers of Buddhism are divided into these two schools.
* Basically Mahayana Buddhism grew out of the Buddha's teaching that each individual carries within himself the potential for Buddhahood.

* Theravadins say that this potential can be realised through individual effort. Mahayanists, on the other hand, believe that they can seek salvation through the intervention of other superior beings called Bodhisatvas.
* According to them, Bodhisatvas are future Buddhas who, out of compassion for their fellow human beings, have delayed their own attainment of Buddhahood until they have helped others towards liberation.

* In spite of this basic difference, however, it must be stressed that doctrinally there is absolutely no disagreement concerning the Dharma as contained in the sacred Tripitaka texts.
* Because Buddhists have been encouraged by the Master to carefully inquire after the truth, they have been free to interpret the scriptures according to their understanding.

* But above all, both Mahayana and Theravada are one in their acceptance of the Buddha and His teachings as the only method to attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

# Vajrayana Buddhism

*  Vajrayana is another school of Buddhism followed in Tibet and Mongolia.
* It leans more towards the Mahayana sect, according to Buddhist scholars. 

# Hinayana and Mahayana

* Terms *Hinayana* and *Mahayana* are later innovations, not used during the Buddha's time.
* Theravada, considered the original teaching of the Buddha, was established in Sri Lanka before these terms came into being.
* Mahayana appeared much later, around the beginning of the Christian Era.

# Buddhist Tolerance

* Different schools of Buddhism held different opinions on the Buddha's teachings but never resorted to violence or bloodshed.
* They have co-existed peacefully for over two thousand years. 


# Basic Doctrines

## Tri-Pitaka (Or Tipitaka)

* The Tripitaka is a collection of the Buddha's teachings recorded in Pali.
* It consists of Sutra (conventional teaching), Vinaya (disciplinary code), and Abhidharma (moral psychology).
* Compiled and arranged by Arahants who had direct contact with the Buddha.

## What Is Abhidharma?

* Abhidharma is the analytical doctrine of mental faculties and elements. 
* It provides a profound understanding of the Buddha's teachings on moral psychology and philosophy, contrasting with the conventional discourses in the Sutra Pitaka.

# Understanding the Abhidharma

* The *Abhidharma* provides detailed explanations of how good and bad karmic thoughts are created based on desires and mental states.
* It offers precise analytical interpretations of mental faculties and elements.
* Studying the *Abhidharma* allows for a deeper understanding of the mind, enabling analysis of mental attitudes that lead to mistakes and the development of willpower to avoid evil.

# The Nature of Reality

* The *Abhidharma* teaches that conventional concepts like "I," "you," and "world" do not accurately represent reality's true nature.
* It emphasizes the impermanence, uncertainty, and interconnectedness of all phenomena.
* The *Abhidharma* focuses on ultimate realities (*paramattha dhamma*), including:

    * *Citta:* Consciousness, defined as that which knows or experiences.
    * *Cetasika:* Mental factors arising alongside *citta*.
    * *Rupa:* Physical phenomenon or material form.
    * *Nirvana:* The unconditioned state of bliss, the ultimate goal.

# Mind and Matter (*Nama-Rupa*)

* *Citta*, *cetasika*, and *rupa* are conditioned realities arising from conditions and ceasing when those conditions cease.
* *Nirvana* is an unconditioned reality that does not arise or fall away.
* The *Abhidharma* analyzes mind and matter (*nama-rupa*) in detail, explaining the processes of birth and death.

# Benefits of Studying the Abhidharma

* It clarifies intricate points of Dharma, leading to a deeper understanding of reality and the Path of Emancipation.
* It provides insights into the nature of consciousness, thoughts, and mental processes from an ethical standpoint.
* It explains rebirth in various planes without anything passing from one life to another, supporting the doctrines of Karma and Rebirth.

# Comparison with Modern Psychology

* The *Abhidharma*'s analysis of the mind surpasses modern psychology's scope by addressing concepts like mental impulses (*Javana Citta*) that remain elusive to contemporary psychologists.
* While modern psychology acknowledges a psyche or soul, the *Abhidharma* does not accept this concept.


# Authorship and Importance

* Some scholars debate whether the *Abhidharma* originated from the Buddha himself or evolved from commentaries by later monks.
* The Theravada tradition attributes the essence of the *Abhidharma* to the Buddha, with later disciples contributing to its tabulations and classifications.
* Ultimately, experiencing and understanding the realities described in the *Abhidharma* is paramount, regardless of its authorship.

# Mind And Matter (*Nama-Rupa*)

* Life is a combination of mind (*nama*) and matter (*rupa*), with mind consisting of sensations, perceptions, volitional activities, and consciousness, while matter comprises the four elements: solidity, fluidity, motion, and heat.
* Life is the co-existence of mind and matter, decay is their lack of coordination, death is their separation, and rebirth is their recombination in a new form.

## Each of us, in the ultimate sense, is mind and matter

* Mind experiences objects while matter does not.
* Both mind and matter arise due to conditions and perish immediately.
* Studying these realities provides insight into our true nature, surroundings, reactions, and spiritual goals.

## To gain insight into the nature of the psycho-physical life

* Life is an illusion, a mirage, or a bubble.
* Everything arises from causes and conditions and ceases when they cease.

#### Four Noble Truths

* These truths reveal the true nature of existence, including self-knowledge.
* Recognizing the transitory and unsatisfactory nature of things leads to seeking happiness through mental purity and wisdom.

## The Four Noble Truths are:

* The Noble Truth of *Dukkha* (suffering or unsatisfactoriness)
* The Noble Truth of the Cause of *Dukkha*
* The Noble Truth of the End of *Dukkha*
* The Noble Truth of the Path leading to the End of *Dukkha*

## Dukkha

* It encompasses suffering, imperfection, impermanence, disharmony, and the awareness of incompleteness.
* It includes physical and mental suffering but also exists during moments of joy due to their impermanent nature.

## The Buddha's Approach to Dukkha

* Recognizing *Dukkha* is not pessimistic but realistic.
* Buddhism offers a cure for *Dukkha*, making it hopeful.
* While happiness exists, it is impermanent and should not distract from the pursuit of liberation.

##### The Danger Of Selfish Desire

* Craving (*tanha*) is the cause of suffering.
* It fuels attachment to impermanent things, leading to disappointment and suffering.
* Craving is a powerful force present in all beings and drives unwholesome actions.

## The Third Noble Truth:

* Eliminating craving at its root ends suffering.
* This state is called *Nirvana*, which is free from suffering and rebirth.
* *Nirvana* is beyond logic and reasoning and requires walking the Eightfold Path for realization.

#### The Noble Eightfold Path - The Middle Way

* It is a way of life that avoids extremes of sensual pleasures and self-mortification.
* It emphasizes self-imposed discipline for self-purification.
* Following this path leads to righteousness, insight, and harmony with universal law.

##### Gradual Development

* The Eightfold Path allows for gradual spiritual development over lifetimes.
* *Sila* (Morality), *Samadhi* (Mental Culture), and *Pañña* (Wisdom) are developed simultaneously but with varying intensity based on individual progress.





# The Eightfold Path

* Consists of eight factors divided into three categories: Morality, Mental Culture and Wisdom. 
* Aims to eliminate suffering by cultivating wholesome qualities and eradicating unwholesome ones.

# What is Right Understanding?

*  Means understanding the Four Noble Truths and the nature of karma (merits and demerits).
* Leads to the avoidance of evil and the performance of good deeds, creating favorable outcomes in life.
* Encompasses understanding the Three Characteristics of Life (impermanence, suffering, and non-self) and the Law of Dependent Origination.

# Right Thought

* Also known as Right Resolution, Right Aspirations, or Right Ideas.
* Involves eliminating wrong ideas and promoting moral factors that lead to Nirvana.
* Has three aspects: detachment from worldly pleasures, loving-kindness and benevolence, and thoughts of harmlessness and compassion.

# Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood

* These are the factors under Morality.
* **Right Speech:** Involves truthful and respectful communication, avoiding lies, slander, harsh speech, and idle talk.
* **Right Action:** Encompasses respect for life, property, and personal relationships, corresponding to abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
* **Right Livelihood:** Means earning a living without violating the principles of Right Speech and Right Action, avoiding occupations that involve harm or exploitation.

# Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration

* These are the factors for developing wisdom through mind purification.
* **Right Effort:** Cultivating positive attitudes, enthusiasm, and sustained determination in all endeavors.
* **Right Mindfulness:** Being constantly aware of the body, feelings, mind, and mental objects, staying present and attentive.
* **Right Concentration:** Sustained application of attention on a single object without distractions, leading to mental well-being and insight.

# The Noble Eightfold Path: A Prescription for Ending Suffering

* The Buddha identified *Dukkha* (unsatisfactoriness) as the disease afflicting all beings.
* He diagnosed the cause as selfish greed and craving.
* He prescribed the Noble Eightfold Path as the cure, leading to *Nirvana*, the cessation of suffering.
* It is a holistic therapy addressing both physical and psychological aspects of well-being.

# Everything Is Changeable


* Highlights the impermanent nature of life and existence.
* Emphasizes the constant flux between opposites, such as joy and sorrow, success and failure.
* Encourages equanimity in the face of life's inevitable changes.

# The Impermanence of All Things

* Everything is in a constant state of flux and change.
* Nothing is permanent; everything arises, exists for a moment, and then passes away.
* This applies to both material forms and life itself.
* Recognizing impermanence is a key teaching in Buddhism.

# The Law of Karma

* Karma is an impersonal law of cause and effect that governs our actions and their consequences.
* It operates without external intervention or judgment.
* Our deeds, words, and thoughts shape our experiences, both in this life and future lives.
* Karma is not predetermined fate; we have the power to change our karma through conscious action.

# Misconceptions Regarding Karma

* Some believe that everything is predetermined by past actions, a Supreme Being, or chance.
* This view removes personal responsibility for our actions.
* Another misconception is that karma only applies to certain people based on their religious beliefs.
* Buddhism teaches that karma operates universally, regardless of faith.

# Understanding Karma Through Analogies

* Karma can be compared to seeds: the results are stored within us and manifest under favorable conditions.
* It can also be likened to a bank account: virtuous actions add to our "good karma" balance, while negative actions deplete it.

# Our Responsibility and Power

* We are responsible for our own happiness and suffering through our actions.
* While we cannot escape the consequences of past karma, we have the power to change our future karma through conscious effort.
* By leading a virtuous life, we can purify our minds and create positive karmic results.

# Karma isequated to the action of a person. This action also creates some karmic results. But each and every action carried out without any purposeful intention, cannot become a *kusala-karma* (skilful action) or *akusala-karma* (unskilful action).

* That is why the Buddha describes *karma* as volitional activities.
* Whatever good and bad deeds we commit without any purposeful intention, are not strong enough to be carried forward to our next life.
* Ignorance of the nature of the good and bad effect of the *karma* is not an excuse to justify or avoid the karmic results if they were committed intentionally.

# The radical transformations in the characters of Angulimala and Asoka illustrate human beings' potential to gain control over karmic forces.

* Angulimala was a highway robber who murdered more than a thousand of his fellow men.
* Can we judge him by his external actions? For within his lifetime through sheer self -effort, he became an Arahanta and thus redeemed his past misdeeds.
* Asoka, the Emperor of India, killed thousands and thousands to fight his wars and to expand his empire.
* Yet after winning the battle, he completely reformed himself and changed his career to such an extent that today, *'Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines and shines almost alone, as a star,'* says the historian, H.G. Wells.

# Other Factors Which Support Karma

* Although Buddhism says that a person can eventually control his or her karmic force, it does not state that everything is due to *karma.*
* Buddhism does not ignore the role played by other forces of nature.
* According to Buddhism there are five orders or processes of natural laws *(niyama)* which operate in the physical and mental worlds:

    1. *utu niyama* (seasonal laws) relating to the physical inorganic order e.g., seasonal phenomena of winds and rains, etc.,
    2. *bija niyama* (biological laws) relating to the order of germs and seeds,
    3. karma niyama (karmic law) relating to moral causation or the order of act and result,
    4. *dharma niyama* (natural phenomena)relating to electrical forces, movement of tides etc., and 5. *citta niyama* (psychological laws) which govern the processes of consciousness.

* Thus *karma* is considered only as one of the five natural laws that account for the diversity in this world.

# Can Karma Be Changed?

* Karma is often influenced by circumstances: beneficent and malevolent forces act to counter and to support this self-operating law.
* The other forces that either aid or hinder this *karma* are birth, time or conditions, appearances, and effort.

# Impartial Energy

* Those who do not believe that there is an energy known as *karma* should understand that this karmic energy is not a byproduct of any particular religion although Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism recognize and explain the nature of this energy.
* This is an existing universal law which has no religious label. 
* All those who violate this law, have to face the consequences irrespective of their religious beliefs, and those who live in accordance with this law experience peace and happiness in their life.

# Classification Of Karma

* Karma is classified in four ways according to:

    1. the time in which effects are worked out;
    2. function—*Kicca*;
    3. the priority of effect; and
    4. the place in which the karmic effects transpire.

# Is Everything Due To Karma?

##### Why Some Wicked People Enjoy While Some Good People Suffer

* Some good people suffer because they haven't accumulated enough good karma from previous births to overcome bad karma in this life.
* Some wicked people prosper due to strong good karma from past lives.
* Examples are given of people with naturally strong constitutions versus those who struggle with health despite efforts.
* While good and bad deeds have consequences, we can change our future by cultivating the mind and living nobly.

#### Rebirth[^6]

* Buddhists view rebirth as a verifiable fact, not just a theory.
* Belief in rebirth is found in various cultures and religions throughout history.
* Examples of historical figures who believed in rebirth are given (Pythagoras, Plato, Origen, Bruno, Kant, Schopenhauer).
* It's difficult to remember past lives due to hindrances like desire, ill-will, and doubt.

* The shortness of life suggests the need for multiple lifetimes to fully experience and develop our potential.
* Buddhism differs from Hinduism by not believing in a permanent soul that transmigrates; rebirth is driven by clinging to existence.
* Death is seen as a transition to a new rebirth, driven by unsatisfied desires.

##### How Does Rebirth Take Place?


* When the body dies, energies don't disappear but take on another form (rebirth).
* Karmic force can manifest in different realms of existence, including animal forms.
* Rebirth happens due to craving and desire for continued existence.
* Some people have spontaneously recalled past lives, providing evidence for rebirth.

# Rebirth

* Some people have revealed information of previous lives through hypnotism.
* Rebirth occurs naturally and is not created by any religion or god.
* Belief in rebirth does not affect the process of rebirth.
* Rebirth continues as long as there is craving for existence and sensual pleasures.
* Those who wish to avoid rebirth must eradicate their cravings and attachments.

# Is Rebirth Simultaneous?

* The timing of rebirth after death is debated even among Buddhist scholars.
* Abhidharma states that rebirth occurs immediately after death without an intermediate state.
* Some believe a person becomes a spirit for a period before rebirth.
* Another interpretation suggests the deceased person's consciousness remains in space, sustained by craving and attachment until rebirth.

# Dying Moment

* Three types of consciousness function at death: rebirth-linking consciousness, the current of passive consciousness, and consciousness disconnecting the present life.
* Rebirth-linking consciousness arises at the moment of death with three signs as its objects.
* It lasts for five faint thought-moments before sinking into the current of passive consciousness.
* Consciousness disconnecting the present life then arises, ending the present life.

# Nirvana

* Nirvana is the highest bliss, a supra-mundane state of eternal happiness.
* Nirvana cannot be experienced through sensory indulgence but by calming them.
* It is not nothingness or extinction, nor is it a paradise.
* Nirvana is a state beyond suffering and change, where defilements are absent.
* It can be attained in this life through right conduct, meditation, and purification.

# Nirvana And Samsara

* Nagarjuna states that Samsara and Nirvana are one, meaning there's no difference between the voidness of component things and the unconditioned state of Nirvana.
* Samsara is described as the continuation of physical and mental aggregates, while Nirvana is their extinction.

# Law Of Dependent Origination

* The Law of Dependent Origination is a crucial Buddhist teaching explaining that all phenomena arise due to conditions.
* It is equally important to the Four Noble Truths in understanding the Buddha's Enlightenment.
* This law emphasizes that nothing exists independently but arises from interconnected causes and conditions.

# Dependent Origination

* Life is built on a set of relations where factors arise and cease based on other conditioning factors.
* This principle is known as the Law of Dependent Origination (*Paticca-samuppada*) and emphasizes that all phenomena are relative and conditioned states.
* Nothing in this world is permanent or unique, including an ego or eternal soul.

# The Illusion of Permanency

* We create fictions of permanency due to our desires, clinging to what we deem desirable and rejecting the undesirable.
* This delusion prevents us from realizing the impermanent nature of reality, which is like a mirage or illusion.

# Illustration through Examples

* An oil lamp flame depends on oil and wick; if either is absent, the flame ceases.
* A plant's growth depends on seed, earth, moisture, air, and sunlight.
* All phenomena arise dependently upon other causal factors, making the concept of a first cause impossible.

# Dependent Origination and Suffering

* The Law of Dependent Origination explains the continuity of existence (birth after birth) and the problem of suffering.
* It is not a theory of the universe's origin but focuses on the causes of rebirth and suffering.

# Twelve Factors of Dependent Origination

1. Ignorance conditions volitional actions (karma).
2. Volitional actions condition consciousness.
3. Consciousness conditions mental and physical phenomena.
4. Mental and physical phenomena condition the six faculties (five senses and mind).
5. Six faculties condition contact.
6. Contact conditions sensation.
7. Sensation conditions desire ('thirst').
8. Desire conditions clinging.
9. Clinging conditions becoming.
10. Becoming conditions birth.
11. Birth conditions decay, death, sorrow, etc.

# The Cycle of Rebirth

* Ignorance and volitional actions belong to the past life.
* Consciousness, mental/physical phenomena, senses, contact, sensation, desire, clinging, and becoming are present-life factors.
* Birth and decay/death belong to the future life.

# Cessation of Suffering

* The cycle can be broken by eradicating ignorance through insight into the true nature of phenomena.
* This leads to the cessation of volitional actions, consciousness, and ultimately, birth, decay, death, and suffering.

# Eternalism and Nihilism

* The Buddha rejected eternalism (belief in eternal life) because nothing is truly permanent.
* He also rejected nihilism (belief in no afterlife) as it ignores mental conditionality and the continuity of existence.




# The Buddha's Teachings on Speculation

* The Buddha discouraged speculative arguments during his teachings. He believed that focusing on genuine solutions to human problems was more important than engaging in pointless debates.

* He refused to engage in speculations about the universe, stating that the present moment is what matters most for human beings.

# Can The First Cause Be Known?

* It's difficult to understand how the world came into existence without a first cause, but it's even harder to conceive of how that first cause itself came to be.
* Buddhism teaches that there is no answer to the question of a first cause because the very concept arises from human limitations in understanding time and relativity.

* The Buddha advised people to focus on addressing their present suffering rather than getting lost in theoretical speculations about the origin of the world.

# Is There An Eternal Soul?

* Belief in an eternal soul is a misconception, according to Buddhism.
* The Buddha taught that what we perceive as "self" or "soul" is merely a combination of constantly changing physical and mental forces.

* He refuted both eternalist and annihilationist views on the soul, emphasizing that clinging to any concept of self hinders self-realization.

* The Buddha's Anatta doctrine teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging essence within us. Instead, we are a dynamic flow of ever-changing experiences.

# The Anatta Doctrine

* The Buddha's *Anatta* doctrine, stating that there is no permanent soul or self, aligns with modern scientific thought.
* Modern science views the universe as a flux of energy, supporting the Buddhist concept of impermanence.

# Buddhism Vis-A-Vis Other Approaches

* Some scholars believe Buddhism would benefit from incorporating the concept of a soul, but this contradicts the Buddha's original teachings.
* The Buddha emphasized the unsatisfactoriness of clinging to a permanent self and likened it to mistaking a rope for a snake.

# Is Buddhism Similar to Other Contemporary Teachings in India?

* The Buddha's Dharma was unique and not simply a reformulation of existing Indian religions.
* He challenged established Vedic Brahmanic beliefs and practices, leading to criticism from traditional religious groups.
* While the Buddha acknowledged the value of truth wherever found, he also refuted false claims and mythology.

# Is Buddhism A Theory Or A Philosophy?

* The Buddha's enlightenment was not based on intellectual theory but on direct experience and realization.
* Buddhism emphasizes practice and realization over mere intellectual understanding.
* While philosophy can be valuable, it cannot provide the practical solutions to suffering that Buddhism offers.
* The Buddha focused on the Four Noble Truths as a practical path to liberation from suffering.

# Enlightenment

* Enlightenment is about dispelling ignorance.
* It is not an intellectual pursuit but requires personal experience.
* Meditation is a practical system to verify truth through experience and insight.

# Is Buddhism Pessimistic?

* Buddhism is realistic, neither pessimistic nor optimistic.
* While acknowledging suffering as part of life, it also teaches the way to overcome it.
* The Buddha's teachings emphasize peace, serenity, hope, and goodwill.
* He encouraged joy and contentment in the present moment.
* Buddhism offers hope for salvation to all beings, unlike some religions that believe in eternal damnation.

# Is Buddhism Atheistic?

* Buddhism does not believe in an eternal, omnipotent creator God.
* It rejects godlessness that denies moral and spiritual values.
* The term "atheism" often carries negative connotations that don't apply to Buddhism.
* Buddhism recognizes the limitations of this material world and seeks true happiness through Nirvana.
* Buddhist values are grounded in the present existence while aiming for ultimate realization. 




### 7. Moral Foundation For Humanity

* The purpose of life is to achieve the end of suffering or unsatisfactoriness.
* Guidelines can be given, but you must create the necessary conditions for the arising of realisation yourself.

##### Understanding The Nature Of Human Beings

* Humans have yet to delve into the inner workings of their own minds and develop them to their fullest potential.
* People must make an effort to overcome ignorance to arrive at realization and Enlightenment.
* They are continually in the process of becoming, always changing.

##### Understanding The Nature Of Life

* Most people dislike facing the facts of life and prefer to lull themselves into a false sense of security by dreaming and imagining.
* We need a better understanding of our life, which doesn't always proceed as smoothly as we would like it to.
* Wealth, luxury, and respectable positions in life are an illusion because they are impermanent.

##### The Need For A Religion

* To understand the real purpose of life, it is advisable for a person to choose and follow an ethical-moral system that discourages evil deeds, encourages good, and enables the purification of the mind.
* Religion has the power to transform a person with negative characteristics into someone with positive qualities.
* Buddhism teaches a person how to calm down the senses and make the heart and mind peaceful.

##### Searching For A Purpose In Life

* The aim in life varies among individuals, but everyone aims for happiness in life.
* 'The value of life lies not in the length of the days, but in the use we make of them'.

##### Realisation

* Once we realise the nature of life and greed, we can understand why the happiness so desperately sought by many people is so elusive.
* It is here that the adoption of a religion becomes important, since it encourages contentment and urges a person to look beyond the demands of his or her flesh and ego.
* Leading such a positive and wholesome life on earth and creating happiness for oneself and others is much better than a selfish life of trying to satisfy one's ego and greed.

# Self-Transformation

* Individuals will strive for self-awareness in their thoughts, speech, and actions.
* They aim for beneficial actions driven by compassion.
* The Noble Eightfold Path guides moral strength through restraint and positive qualities.
* This path cultivates mental purity, expanding understanding of phenomena and life.
* Wisdom grows alongside love, compassion, kindness, and joy.

# Buddhism For Human Beings In Society

* Buddhism is accessible to both those in society and seclusion.
* The misconception that Buddhism requires monastic life is addressed.
* The Noble Eightfold Path is for all people, regardless of their lifestyle.
* True renunciation involves inner purity rather than physical isolation.
* Laypeople can successfully practice Buddhism and attain Nirvana.

# The Buddhist Way Of Life For Householders

* Economic well-being is considered important for happiness.
* Four virtues contribute to worldly happiness: skill in profession, protecting income, good friends, and reasonable spending.
* Four virtues lead to happiness hereafter: faith, morality, generosity, and wisdom.
* The Buddha emphasized saving and spending wisely.
* A householder's happiness includes economic security, generous spending, freedom from debt, and a pure life.
* Material progress should be balanced with spiritual and moral development.

### 8. Buddhist Morality And Practice

* Buddhist ethics are based on universal values, not human-made laws or social customs. They are rooted in natural law and aim to guide individuals towards ultimate happiness.

* Buddhist morality emphasizes personal responsibility for one's actions and encourages understanding and effort as the path to liberation. It focuses on avoiding evil, doing good, and purifying the mind.
* Actions are judged based on intention, but Buddhism does not condone harmful acts even with good intentions. Deeds reflect the state of mind, and a pure mind cannot commit immoral actions.

#### What Is Vinaya?

* Vinaya is a code of discipline for monks and nuns to ensure their pure religious way of life. It was gradually developed by the Buddha as the monastic order grew.
* Vinaya consists of universal moral codes (Lokavajja) applicable to all and disciplinary codes (Paññatti Vajja) specific to monks and nuns, addressing manners, traditions, duties, customs, and etiquette.

##### Development Of Sangha Community




# The Sangha Community

* The Sangha community evolved into several sects with varying interpretations of the Buddha's teachings.
* The Theravada sect adhered strictly to the Vinaya, while other sects were more liberal.

# Adapting to Changing Times

* Monks should adapt their practices to different cultures and environments while upholding the essence of the Dharma.
* Blind adherence to outdated rules can lead to ridicule and misunderstandings.

# Lay Buddhist Practices

* The disciplinary code for lay devotees provides guidance on leading a virtuous life without renouncing worldly possessions.
* Some Vinaya rules are specific to monks and not applicable to lay people.

# The Role of the Sangha Council

* The Sangha Council has the authority to amend minor precepts and impose sanctions on monks who violate the disciplinary code.
* Monks cannot change rules at their own discretion.

# Maintaining Respect and Dignity

* Monks are respected figures in Asian societies and should conduct themselves accordingly.
* Their actions reflect on the entire Sangha community, so they must avoid behaviors that could damage its reputation.

# Dharma and Vinaya

* The Dharma (Buddha's teachings) is unchanging, but some Vinaya rules can be adapted to changing circumstances.
* It's important to distinguish between essential religious principles and cultural traditions.

# Handling Money

* Monks may need to handle money for their religious activities and daily needs.
* They should remain unattached to material possessions and use money ethically.

# Characteristics of a Monk

* Purity, voluntary poverty, humility, simplicity, selfless service, self-control, patience, compassion, and harmlessness are key characteristics of a monk.
* Monks observe four kinds of higher morality: Patimokkha Sila, Indriyasamvara Sila, Ajivaparisuddhi Sila, and Paccayasannissita Sila.

# Ten Meritorious And Ten Evil Actions


* Performing good deeds accumulates merit, which purifies the mind.
* Demeritorious deeds lead to suffering and hinder spiritual progress.

# Merit 

* Merit is important for personal growth and leads to happiness both now and in the future.
* It cannot be lost like material possessions and opens doors to opportunities.
* Performing merit allows one to be reborn in heavens and helps attain Nirvana.

# Rich Fields of Merit

* Some recipients of good deeds yield more merit than others.
* The Sangha, parents, and the needy are considered rich fields of merit.
* Good deeds towards these individuals manifest in many ways and bring bountiful results.

# Ten Meritorious Deeds

* The Buddha taught ten meritorious deeds for a happy and peaceful life: generosity, morality, mental culture, reverence, service, transference of merits, rejoicing in others' merits, preaching Dharma, listening to Dharma, and straightening one's views.
* These deeds benefit oneself and others, promoting harmony, peace, and understanding.

# Ten Evil Deeds

* There are ten demeritorious deeds rooted in greed, hatred, and delusion that bring suffering.
* Three bodily actions: killing, stealing, and illicit sexual behavior.
* Four verbal actions: lying, slander, harsh speech, and frivolous talk.
* Three mental actions: covetousness, ill-will, and wrong views.

# Precepts

* Buddhist morality is based on the law of Karma and considers the impact of actions on oneself and others.
* Intention or motivation (*cetana*) determines whether an action is good or bad.
* Greed, hatred, and delusion are "evil roots," while love, charity, and wisdom are "beneficial roots."
* Buddhists cleanse themselves of mental defilements for spiritual growth and to minimize suffering.

# Five Precepts




# Lay Buddhist Morality

* Lay Buddhist morality is embodied in the Five Precepts, which enable people to live together harmoniously and serve as a starting point for spiritual growth.
* Unlike commandments imposed from above, precepts are voluntarily accepted by individuals who recognize their usefulness for self-discipline.

* Buddhists should remind themselves daily of the Five Precepts: refraining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxicants.

* The Five Ennoblers complement the Five Precepts: loving kindness, renunciation, contentment, truthfulness, and mindfulness.

* Observing the precepts cultivates positive qualities rather than negativity.

# The Purpose of Precepts

* The precepts eliminate crude passions expressed through thought, word, and deed.
* They provide an indispensable basis for meditation practice by preventing misuse for selfish ends.

# Eight Precepts

* On certain days, devotees observe the Eight Precepts, abstaining from: killing, stealing, sexual acts, lying, intoxicants, eating after noon, sensual entertainment, and luxurious seats.

* This practice aims to develop relaxation, tranquility, train the mind, and foster spiritual development.

* Devotees spend this time engaged in religious activities like reading, listening to teachings, meditating, and helping at the temple.
* The Eight Precepts are temporary and not a permanent requirement for lay Buddhists.

# Loving-Kindness

* Despite material wealth and intellectual advancements, the world lacks spirituality and loving-kindness, hindering peace and security.

* Material gain alone cannot bring lasting happiness; inner peace is essential for external peace.

* Loving-kindness involves practicing non-violence, overcoming selfishness, and showing others the right path.

* Selfless love, or altruistic love, is emphasized in Buddhism, where the focus is on the well-being of others without expecting anything in return.
* Buddhists distinguish between selfish love ("Prema") and selfless love ("Karuna" or "Metta").

* Universal love (Metta) encompasses all sentient beings and is exemplified by the Buddha's boundless compassion and dedication to alleviating suffering.

## # Real Charity

* True charity involves giving freely without expecting anything in return, reducing selfish desires.
* It should not be used to control others or make them feel indebted.

## # Buddhist Attitude Towards Human Organ Donations

* Organ donation after death is considered an act of charity and aligns with Buddhist principles.
* Dana, the Pali term for charity, encompasses giving material possessions, bodily organs, and services for a worthy cause.
* Buddhism emphasizes reducing suffering and cultivating virtues like loving-kindness and compassion through acts of charity.
* Fear of organ donation stems from misunderstanding the nature of existence; consciousness transmigrates after death, leaving the body behind.

## # The Buddhist Attitude To Animal Life

* Animals are conscious beings with instinctive power and limited thinking capacity.
* While humans possess reasoning abilities, animals excel in other areas like senses.
* Buddhism rejects the notion that animals were created for human benefit.
* Buddhists are encouraged to practice loving-kindness towards all living beings and avoid causing harm or taking their lives.
* Destroying animals disrupts the Universal Order and is considered unethical.

# The Buddha and Animal Sacrifice

* The Buddha opposed cruelty to all living beings.
* He offered himself as a sacrifice instead of an animal to demonstrate his point.
* This act convinced a man to abandon animal sacrifice and embrace Buddhism.

# Human Cruelty Towards Animals

* Humans are cruel to animals due to uncontrolled greed.
* This cruelty harms the environment and threatens human survival.
* While some creatures pose threats to humans, they only take what they need to survive.

# The Need For Tolerance Today

* People today are restless, fearful, and driven by material desires.
* Intolerance and dogmatism have caused suffering throughout history.
* Despite technological advancements, humanity struggles with peaceful coexistence.

# Buddhist Funeral Rites

* Proper Buddhist funeral rites are simple, solemn, and dignified.
* Extraneous rituals and superstitions have been added to traditional practices.
* Cremation is preferable for hygienic and economic reasons.
* Buddhists believe consciousness is separate from the body and does not linger after death.




### 9. Dharma And Ourselves As Refuge

* Buddhists take refuge in the Buddha to gain inspiration and right understanding for their self-purification and to affirm their confidence in the Buddha or to recall the Buddha to their minds.
* Buddhists do not take refuge in the Buddha with the belief that He is a God or son of God. The Buddha never claimed any divinity.

#### Why We Take Refuge In The Buddha

* Buddhists do not pray to the Buddha thinking that He is a god who will reward them or punish them.
* They recite verses or some sutras not in the sense of supplication but as a means of recalling His great virtues and good qualities to get more inspiration and guidance for themselves and to develop the confidence to follow His Teachings so that they too could be like Him.

#### No Self Surrender

* Dependence on others means surrendering one's intelligence and efforts.
* Buddhism is a gentle religion where equality, justice and peace reign supreme.
* Everything which has improved and uplifted humanity has been done by human beings themselves. Their improvement must come from their own knowledge, understanding, effort and experience and not from heaven.

#### No Sinners

* Buddhists do not regard humans as sinful by nature or 'in rebellion against god'. Every human being is a person of great worth who has within him or herself a vast store of good as well as evil habits.
* Buddhism teaches that everyone is responsible for his or her own good and bad deeds, and that each individual can mould his or her own destiny.
* Buddhists do not accept the belief that this world is merely a place of trial and testing. This world can be made a place where we can attain the highest perfection.

# Buddhism and Sin

* Buddhists do not believe in sin as a transgression of divine law.
* Unwholesome actions (akusala karma) create suffering (papa).
* Wickedness is seen as ignorance requiring guidance, not punishment.

# The Buddha's Purpose

* The Buddha aims to show the foolishness of evil and its consequences.
* There are no commandments in Buddhism because spiritual growth is individual.
* Precepts are voluntary training rules for self-development.

# Do It Yourself

* Self-confidence is crucial in Buddhism, emphasizing self-reliance.
* Salvation depends on individual effort, like curing a disease through personal action.
* Buddhists must actively follow the Buddha's teachings to overcome suffering.

# Human Beings Are Responsible For Everything

* Humans create their own destiny and are responsible for their experiences.
* Suffering arises from our own imperfections and past actions.
* We have the power to overcome negative tendencies and cultivate good qualities.

# Human Beings Are Their Own Jailors

* True freedom is limited by internal and external factors, including societal norms and natural laws.
* Humans possess harmful elements that require restraint for the well-being of all.
* Religion helps train individuals to live ethically and peacefully.

# You Protect Yourself

* Protecting oneself through mindfulness also protects others.
* Practicing patience, non-violence, loving-kindness, and compassion safeguards both self and others.
* These two aspects are interconnected and mutually reinforcing.

# Protecting Oneself One Protects Others

* Self-protection is not selfish protection; it's self-control and ethical/spiritual development.
* Protecting oneself protects others at a practical level (health, safety) and an ethical level (moral restraint).
* Greed, hate, and delusion harm ourselves and others. Our bad example can influence others negatively.

# You Have To Save Yourself

* Individuals are responsible for their own deliverance from Samsara.
* Buddhism encourages selfless service while emphasizing personal responsibility for attaining Nirvana.
* Self-reliance doesn't mean neglecting others; it means developing the ability to help oneself and, in turn, contribute to the well-being of others.

# The Evolution of Self-Reliance

* Even lower life forms have the potential to create good karma and evolve towards higher levels of understanding.
* The story of the Buddha-to-be saving his mother illustrates seeking help from devas for material needs while striving for spiritual enlightenment.
* Buddhists can seek help from devas in daily life, but ultimately, self-reliance through following the Noble Eightfold Path is crucial for liberation from suffering.

# Understanding Detachment

* As we gain understanding through many lives, our desire for sensory pleasures decreases.
* We become self-reliant at this stage.
* Buddhists who understand impermanence practice detachment from possessions.
* They share freely with those less fortunate.

# The Buddha's Compassion

* After enlightenment, the Buddha shared his knowledge out of compassion.
* He taught for 45 years, helping humans and even devas.
* The Buddha helped devotees through wisdom and compassion, not miracles.

# Kisa Gotami and the Mustard Seeds

* Kisa Gotami sought the Buddha's help to revive her dead child.
* The Buddha asked her to find mustard seeds from someone who hadn't lost a loved one.
* This made her realize death is natural.

# Understanding Suffering

* The Buddha focused on helping Kisa Gotami understand life, not providing temporary relief.
* She learned that attachment causes suffering and its destruction ends suffering.

# Self-Reliance in Buddhism

* Initially, people may seek help from external forces like devas for happiness.
* As attachment to worldly things fades, the path towards enlightenment begins.
* Liberation requires self-effort and willpower; "No one saves us but ourselves."

# Human Potential in Buddhism

* Buddhism emphasizes human potential and the ability to liberate oneself.
* Humans are not at the mercy of external forces in later stages of development.

# Faith, Confidence And Devotion

* Buddhism emphasizes understanding over faith.
* Confidence is based on reason, knowledge, and experience, unlike blind faith.
* Confidence is a product of the mind's ability to understand life.

# The Meaning Of Prayer

* Humans are capable of self-mastery; ignorance prevents them from realizing their potential.
* Prayer in Buddhism is meditation focused on self-transformation.
* It involves purifying thoughts, words, and deeds.

# Meditation

* Meditation is a psychological approach for mental training and purification.
* Mental culture is essential for spiritual development and reaching Nirvana.
* An untrained mind can lead to suffering, while meditation helps control it.

# Meditation

* Many illnesses can be avoided through meditation.
* Meditation should not be forced but rather something that brings joy.
* Buddhist meditation aims to bring the mind back to the present moment.
* The Buddha attained enlightenment through self-effort and meditation.

# Nature Of Modern Life

* Modern life is characterized by hard work and competition, leading to stress and a lack of peace.
* True relaxation comes from controlling the senses through the mind.
* Meditation requires determination, effort, patience, and a suitable object.
* Practising meditation is like swimming against the current; it takes time and perseverance.

# The Significance Of Paritta Chanting

* Paritta chanting involves reciting Buddhist sutras for protection and blessings.
* These sutras were originally recorded on ola leaves and later compiled into a book.
* Different intonations are used in chanting to create specific psychological states and influence different beings.
* Rhythms in chanting are also found in other religions, such as Islam and Hinduism.

* When sutras are chanted, the forces of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are activated.
* The Buddha's teachings remain a powerful source of inspiration and blessings even after his physical presence is gone.

## Dharma

* It is the power of truth, justice and peace discovered by the Buddha which provides spiritual solace for devotees to maintain peace and happiness.
* When you develop compassion, devotion and understanding, this power protects you and helps you develop more confidence and strength in your mind.
* Those who cannot understand the power of the Dharma surrender themselves to superstitious beliefs and subject themselves to various gods and spirits.

## The Sangha

* This word refers to the holy order of monks who have renounced their worldly life for spiritual development.
* They are considered disciples of the Buddha, who have cultivated great virtues to attain sainthood or Arahantahood.
* The chanting of sutras was started during the Buddha's time and later developed further in certain Buddhist countries.

## Are Buddhists Idol Worshippers?

* Buddhists revere the image of the Buddha as a gesture of respect to the greatest, wisest, most benevolent, compassionate and holy man who has ever lived.
* The 'worshipping' at the Buddha image is quite different from idolatry.
* Buddhists use the statue as a symbol and as an object of concentration to gain peace of mind.
* Understanding Buddhists never ask for worldly favours from the image nor do they request forgiveness for evil deeds committed.



## The Buddha Image

* The Buddha image represents Buddhahood, which is attainable by all.
* It is not obligatory for Buddhists to have an image to practice Buddhism.
* True Buddhists see the Buddha in their daily lives through practicing His teachings.

## Religious Significance Of Fasting

* Fasting is a method of self-control practiced in Buddhism.
* Monks abstain from solid food after noon, and lay people do the same on full moon days.
* Fasting helps develop self-control and allows for sharing food with those in need.
* Many sages who practiced fasting achieved high levels of spirituality.

## Vegetarianism

* A person's purity is not determined by their diet.
* The Buddha did not advocate strict vegetarianism, but advised monks to avoid certain types of meat.
* Devadatta's request for the Buddha to introduce vegetarianism was refused.
* While vegetarianism is praiseworthy, it is not a requirement in Buddhism.

## The Moon And Religious Observances

* Full moon days are significant in Buddhism because many important events in the Buddha's life occurred on them.
* Buddhists observe full moon days with religious practices like meditation and abstaining from worldly pleasures.
* The moon is believed to influence human emotions, health, and even plant life.
* Ancient sages recommended relaxation and spiritual pursuits on full moon days due to its potential influence.

# Life And Culture

* Buddhism is tolerant about traditions and customs provided they are not harmful to the welfare of others.
* Buddhists are advised to experiment with traditions and customs and only accept those that are reasonable and conducive to happiness and the welfare of others.
* Buddhist missionaries do not advise converts to give up their traditions as long as they are reasonable.

# Rites And Rituals

* Rites and rituals are included within customs and traditions and are considered an ornamentation or decoration to beautify a religion.
* While rites and rituals can provide psychological help, one can practice religion without them.
* Buddhism does not consider certain rites and rituals that people believe are essential for salvation as such.

# Festivals

* True Buddhists observe festival days by abstaining from evil, practicing charity, helping others, and entertaining friends and relatives in a dignified way.
* Festivals can sometimes pollute the purity of religion, while a religion without festivals can become dull and lifeless.
* Some people may not be satisfied with religious observances only during festivals and prefer year-round merrymaking.

# Status Of Women In Buddhism

* The Buddha gave women full freedom to participate in religious life, which was unique for his time.
* The Buddha allowed women to enter the Holy Order, proving they had the capacity to attain the highest position in the religious way of life.
* The Buddha stated that a female child may even prove to be a better offspring than a male, as she may grow up wise and virtuous.

# Buddhism And Politics

* The Buddha never resorted to political power to introduce his teaching nor allowed it to be misused for gaining political power.
* It is not justifiable to intermingle religion with politics, as the basis of religion is morality, purity, faith, and wisdom while that for politics is power.
* When religion is used to pander to political whims, it has to forego its high moral ideals and become debased by worldly political demands.

# The Limitations of Political Systems

* No political system can guarantee happiness and prosperity if the people are driven by greed, hatred, and delusion.
* Universal factors like karma, *dukkha*, *anicca*, and *anatta* affect individuals regardless of the political system in place.

# True Freedom

* While a just political system is important, true freedom lies within oneself.
* Individuals must cultivate inner peace by freeing themselves from ignorance and craving through Dharma practice.

# Buddhist Principles and Modern Politics

* The Buddha's teachings on equality, social cooperation, and the rule of law resonate with modern political ideals.
* The Sangha's democratic decision-making process resembles parliamentary systems.

# Buddhist Approach to Political Power

* The focus is on moral leadership and responsible use of power.
* The Buddha advocated nonviolence and peace, even intervening in conflicts.

# Good Governance According to the Buddha

* A just ruler inspires morality throughout society.
* Poverty can lead to crime, which should be addressed through economic development rather than punishment.
* The *Dasa Raja Dharma*, ten rules for good governance, emphasize virtues like generosity, honesty, kindness, and non-violence.

# The Ruler's Responsibility

* A ruler must act impartially, without hatred or fear, and with a clear understanding of the law.
* Unjust rulers face consequences from their subjects.

# Emperor Asoka: An Example of Buddhist Principles in Governance

* Inspired by the Buddha's teachings, Emperor Asoka promoted peace, non-aggression, social welfare, and religious freedom.

# The Buddha as a Social Reformer

* While not his primary focus, the Buddha addressed social issues like caste system, inequality, and the status of women.
* He emphasized inner transformation as the foundation for lasting social reform.




# The Path To Nirvana

*  The primary focus of Buddhism is spiritual liberation (Nirvana) rather than worldly concerns.
* Social reformation is secondary to achieving Nirvana.
* While Buddhists can engage in politics, they should not misuse religion for political gain.

# 12. Marriage, Birth Control And Death

#### Buddhist Views on Marriage

*  Buddhism views marriage as a social institution, not a religious duty.
* Individuals have the freedom to choose whether or not to marry and how many children to have.
* Monks and nuns abstain from marriage to dedicate themselves to spiritual service.

##### Divorce

* Buddhism does not prohibit divorce if couples cannot live harmoniously.
* The Buddha advises against old men marrying young women due to potential incompatibility.

#### Birth Control, Abortion And Suicide

* Buddhists are free to practice birth control as it does not involve taking a life.
* Abortion is considered wrong because it involves killing a being that has already come into existence.
* Suicide is morally and spiritually wrong, as it stems from frustration and delusion.

#### Why Does The World Population Increase?

* Population increase is attributed to advancements in medicine and living conditions.
* Buddhism does not view population growth as evidence against rebirth, as there are countless world systems with infinite beings.

# Sex And Religion
* Human beings are the only species without natural periods of sexual inactivity for recovery.
* The sex impulse is powerful and requires self-control, especially for spiritual aspirants.
* Celibacy aids spiritual development but isn't compulsory in Buddhism; lay people should abstain from sexual misconduct.
* Humans often behave worse than animals due to uncontrolled sexual urges, amplified by modern society.
* Excessive sexual stimulation leads to neuroses, while societal expectations create conflicting pressures.
* Sex should be balanced and controlled, not repressed or exaggerated.

### 13. Nature, Value And Choice Of Religious Beliefs

* **Humans and Religion:**
    * Humans are unique in their development and practice of religion.
    * Early religions stemmed from fear of the unknown and a desire to appease perceived forces in nature.
    * Religions have evolved over time, influenced by various factors like geography, history, and socio-economic conditions.

* **Diversity of Religious Practices:**
    * Religions differ in their approach, understanding, goals, and concepts of reward and punishment.
    * Approaches can be based on faith, fear, rationality, or harmlessness.
    * Some religions emphasize faith, miracles, or devotion, while others focus on reason, karma, or wisdom.

* **Interpretations and Goals:**
    * Religious understanding varies depending on followers' capacity and interpretations by authorities.
    * Religions offer explanations for human problems and inequalities, with differing perspectives on the purpose of suffering.
    * The ultimate goal of spiritual life varies across religions, ranging from eternal life to union with a universal consciousness.

* **Methods and Consequences:**

    * Concepts of punishment for wrongdoing also differ, encompassing divine judgment, karma, or reincarnation.

* **Importance of Openness and Morality:**
    * It is crucial to approach religious doctrines with an open mind and tolerance towards other beliefs.

    * True religiosity involves cultivating goodwill, understanding, and facing problems with spiritual strength.




# Which Is The Proper Religion?

* A proper religion should include the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.
* Buddhism encourages self-reflection and development rather than reliance on external deities.
* Buddhism emphasizes verifiable truths, unlike religions based on blind faith or unsubstantiated claims.
* True religion focuses on universal truths accessible to all, not exclusive doctrines.

# Moral And Spiritual Development

* Buddhism promotes ethical behavior and spiritual growth as essential for societal well-being.
* Morality requires guidance and cultivation; without it, society faces danger.
* Spiritual development is prioritized over material pursuits in Buddhism.
* Virtue (ethical conduct) and wisdom are both crucial for attaining liberation.

# The God-Idea

* The concept of God evolved from primitive people's awe of nature.
* Different cultures developed diverse conceptions of God, reflecting their unique circumstances and understanding.
* Monotheism emerged as a later development, unifying various natural phenomena under one deity.
* Modern science challenges traditional creation myths associated with the God-idea.

# Human Weakness And The Concept Of God

* Both the concept of God and creation myths are defended by believers to justify their existence and usefulness.
* Religions claim to stand for peace and brotherhood but have also spread superstitions, opposed science, and led to conflict.
* Dr. G. Dharmasiri argues that the concept of God can be dangerous due to its association with authority, which threatens individual freedom.

# Changing A Religious Label Before Death

* Changing religion at death is seen as a way to "wash away sins" and gain salvation, but this belief is not supported by Buddhism.
* Buddhists believe that true purification comes from recognizing wrongdoing and striving for good deeds.
* Exploiting the fear of dying people by promising them heaven is unethical.

# Short-Cut To Paradise And End Of The World

* Some religious groups claim to have exclusive access to paradise and try to convert others through fear mongering.
* Buddhists should not be misled by these "paradise peddlers" who often make false predictions about the end of the world.
* True enlightenment comes from understanding the Buddha's teachings, not from blindly accepting claims of a quick path to heaven.

* The Buddha never encouraged rigid, dogmatic belief.
* The Buddha's method for discovering and testing spiritual Truth is very similar to that of the scientist.
* While Buddhism is very much in line with the scientific spirit, it is not correct to equate Buddhism with science.

##### Limitations Of Science

* Scientific knowledge is limited to the data received through the sense organs.
* Science attempts to understand the outer world and has barely scratched the surface of humanity's inner world.
* Science is unable to teach the people to control their minds when they are driven by the animal nature that burns within themselves.
* Science cannot provide a meaningful purpose of life.

##### Learned Ignorance

* The transcendental mind developed by the Buddha is not limited to sense-data and goes beyond the logic trapped within the limitation of relative perception.
* The very limited information perceived makes our understanding of the world distorted.

##### Beyond Science

* Buddhism accepts a wider field of knowledge than science, including knowledge from personal experiences gained through mental culture.
* Religious experience, unlike scientific observation, cannot be understood through experiments.
* The truth found by Buddhism is absolute and unchanging, while scientific truth is relative and subject to change.
* Buddhism encourages people not to cling to theories, but instead to live a righteous life to discover Ultimate Truths.

##### Science Without Religion

### 15. War And Peace

* Humans have forgotten that they have a heart. They forget that if they treat others kindly, others will treat them kindly in return.

* WE are living in a world of really amazing contradictions. On the one hand, people are afraid of war; on the other hand, they prepare for it with frenzy. They produce in abundance, but they distribute miserly. The world becomes more and more crowded, but people become increasingly isolated and lonely. They are living close to each other as in a big family, but each individual finds him or herself more than ever before, separated from his or her neighbour. Mutual understanding and sincerity are lacking very badly. One person cannot trust another, however good the latter may be.

* When the United Nations was formed after the horrors of the Second World War, the heads of Nations who gathered to sign the charter agreed that it should begin with the following preamble: 'Since it is in the minds of men that wars begin, it is in the minds of men the ramparts of peace should be erected'. This very same sentiment is echoed in the first verse of the Dhammapada in which the Buddha states: 'All [mental] states have mind as their forerunner, mind is their chief, and they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts, with a defiled mind, suffering follows one even as the wheel follows the hoof of the draught-ox. '

* The belief that the only way to fight force is by applying more force has led to the arms race between the great powers. And this competition to increase the weapons of war has brought mankind to the very brink of total self-destruction. If we do nothing about it, the next war will be the end of the world where there will be neither victors nor victims—only dead bodies.

* 'Hatred does not cease by hatred; by love alone does it cease.' Such is the Buddha's advice to those who preach the doctrine of antagonism and ill will, and who set men to war and rebellion against one another. Many people say that the Buddha's advice to return good for evil is impractical. Actually, it is the only correct method to solve any problem. This method was introduced by the great Teacher from His own experience. Because we are proud and egoistic, we are reluctant to return good for evil, thinking that the public may treat us as cowardly people. Some people even think that kindness and gentleness are effeminate, not 'macho'! But what harm is there if we settle our problems and bring peace and happiness by adopting this cultured method and by sacrificing our dangerous pride? Many people cannot be satisfied without taking revenge for the mistakes done to them by others.

* Tolerance must be practised if peace is to come to this earth. Force and compulsion will only create intolerance. To establish peace and harmony among mankind, each and everyone must first learn to practise the ways leading to the extinction of hatred, greed and delusion, the roots of all evil forces. If mankind can eradicate these evil forces, tolerance and peace will come to this restless world.

* Today the followers of the most compassionate Buddha have a special duty to work for the establishment of peace in the world and to show an example to others by following their Master's advice: 'All tremble at punishment, all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill.' (DHAMMAPADA 129)

* Peace is always obtainable. But the way to peace is not only through prayers and rituals. Peace is the result of achieving harmony with our fellow beings and with our environment. The peace that we try to introduce by force is not a lasting peace. It is an interval in between the conflict of selfish desire and worldly conditions.

* Peace cannot exist on this earth without the practice of tolerance. To be tolerant, we must not allow anger and jealousy to prevail in our minds. The Buddha says, 'No enemy can harm one so much as one's own thoughts of craving, hate and jealousy.' (DHAMMAPADA 42)

* Buddhism is a religion of tolerance because it preaches a life of self-restraint. Buddhism teaches a life based not on rules but on principles. Buddhism has never persecuted or maltreated those whose beliefs are different. The Teaching is such that it is not necessary for anyone to use the label "Buddhist" to practise the Noble Principles of this religion.

* The world is like a mirror and if you look at the mirror with a smiling face, you can see your own, beautiful smiling face. On the other hand, if you look at it with a long face, you will invariably see ugliness. Similarly, if you treat the world kindly the world will also certainly treat you kindly. Learn to be peaceful with yourself and the world will also be peaceful with you.

* Human kind is given to so much self-deceit that they do not want to admit their own weakness. They will try to find some excuse to justify their action and to create an illusion that they are blameless. If one really wants to be free, one must have the courage to admit one's own weakness. The Buddha says:

>*'Easily seen are other's faults; hard indeed it is to see one's own faults.'*

#### Can We Justify War?

*The difference between a dogfight and a war between two groups of people is only in its preparation.*
* Although human beings have discovered and invented many important things, they have also made great advances towards the destruction of their own kind. This is how many human civilisations have been completely erased from this earth. Modern human beings have become so sophisticated in the art and techniques of warfare that it is now possible for them to reduce entire cities to ashes within a few seconds. The world has become a storehouse of military hardware as a result of a game called 'Military Superiority.'
* We are told that the prototype of a nuclear weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb which was dropped at Hiroshima Japan in August, 1945 is being planned. Scientists believe that a few hundred thermonuclear weapons will chart the course towards universal destruction. Just see what we are doing to our world! Think what sort of scientific development it is! See how foolish and selfish we are! People should not pander to their aggressive instincts. They should uphold the ethical teachings of the religious teachers and display justice with morality to enable peace to prevail.

* Treaties, pacts and peace formulae have been adopted and millions of words have been spoken by countless world leaders throughout the world who proclaim that they have found the way to maintain and promote peace on earth. But for all their efforts, they have not succeeded in removing the threat to mankind. The reason is that we have all failed to educate our young to truly understand and respect the need for selfless service and the danger of selfishness. To guarantee true peace, we must use every method available to us to educate youths to practise love, goodwill and tolerance towards others.

##### The Buddhist Attitude
* Buddhists should not be the aggressors even in protecting their religion or anything else. They must try their best to avoid any kind of violent act. Sometimes they may be forced to go to war by others who do not respect the concept of the brotherhood of humans as taught by the Buddha. They may be called upon to defend their country from external aggression, and as long as they have not renounced the worldly life, they are duty-bound to join in the struggle for peace and freedom. Under these circumstances, they cannot be blamed for becoming soldiers or being involved in defence. However, if everyone were to follow the advice of the Buddha, there would be no reason for war to take place in this world. It is the duty of every cultured person to find all possible ways and means to settle disputes in a peaceful manner, without declaring war to kill his or her fellow human beings. The Buddha did not teach His followers to surrender to any form of evil power be it a human or supernatural being.

* Indeed, with reason and science, humanity has been able to conquer nature, and yet they have to secure their own lives. Why is it that life is in danger? While devoted to reason and being ruled by science, people have forgotten that they have hearts which have been neglected and left to wither and be polluted by passions.

* If we cannot secure our own lives, then how can world peace be possible? To obtain peace, we must train our minds to face facts. We must be objective and humble. We must realise that no one person, nor one nation is always wrong. To obtain peace, we must also share the richness of the earth, if not with equality then at least with equity. There can never be absolute equality but surely there can be a greater degree of equity.

* It is simply inconceivable that five percent of the world's population should enjoy fifty percent of its wealth, or that twentyfive percent of the world should be fairly well-fed and some overfed, while seventy-five percent of the world is always hungry. Peace will only come when nations are willing to share and share equitably, the rich to help the poor and the strong to help the weak, thus creating international goodwill. Only if and when these conditions are met, can we envision a world with no excuse for wars.

* The madness of the armaments race must stop! We must try to build schools instead of air force jets, hospitals instead of nuclear weapons. The amount of money and human lives that various governments waste in the battlefield should be diverted to build up the economies to elevate the standard of living.

* The world cannot have peace until people and nations renounce selfish desires, give up racial arrogance, and eradicate egoistic lust for possession and power. Wealth cannot secure happiness. Religion alone can effect the necessary change of heart and bring about the only real disarmament—that of the mind.

* All religions teach people not to kill; but unfortunately this important precept is conveniently ignored. Today, with modern armaments, we can kill millions within one second, that is, more than so called "primitive" tribes did in a century.

* Very unfortunately some people in certain countries bring religious labels, slogans and banners into their battlefields. They do not know that they are disgracing the good name of religion.
* 'Verily, O monk,' said the Buddha, 'due to sensual craving, kings fight with kings, princes with princes, priests with priests, citizens with citizens, the mother quarrels with the son, the son quarrels with the father, brother with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.' (MAJJIHIMA NIKAYA)
* We can happily say that for the last 2,500 years there has never been any serious discord or conflict created by Buddhists that led to war in the name of this religion. This is a result of the dynamic character of the concept of tolerance contained in the Buddha's teaching.

#### Can Buddhists Join The Army?
*You can be a soldier of Truth, but not an aggressor.*

* ONE day, Sinha, a general of an army, went to the Buddha and said, ' I am a soldier, O Blessed One. I am appointed by the King to enforce his laws and to wage his wars. The Buddha teaches infinite love, kindness and compassion for all sufferers: Does the Buddha permit the punishment of the criminal? And also, does the Buddha declare that it is wrong to go to war for the protection of our homes, our wives, our children and our property? Does the Buddha teach the doctrine of complete selfsurrender? Should I suffer the evil-doer to do what he pleases and yield submissively to him who threatens to take by violence what is my own? Does the Buddha maintain that all strife including warfare waged for a righteous cause should be forbidden?'

# Mercy Killing

* Mercy killing is not justified according to Buddhism.
* Killing a pet out of compassion is still considered killing and has negative consequences.
* Even if intentions are good, the act of killing creates unwholesome results.
* Buddhists believe in helping alleviate suffering but not ending life prematurely.

# Killing For Self-Protection

* The Buddha advises against killing even in self-defense.
* Loving-kindness is the best weapon for protection.
* While unintentional killing during self-defense may not create bad karma, intentional killing always does.
* Buddhism rejects justifications like "humane killing" or "mercy killing" as they still involve taking a life.

# The Buddhist Stand On The Death Sentence

* Buddhists respect and obey the law of the country.
* Religion and law are separate entities; religion teaches goodness while law enforces order.
* Buddhists can plead for clemency but cannot interfere with legal processes.
* Laws, even those involving capital punishment, should be respected as they maintain societal order.
* The Buddha did not oppose the death penalty for serious crimes committed by monks.




### 16. Realms Of Existence

* There are three schools of thought regarding the origin of the world: nature, God, or inconceivable beginning and end.
* Buddhism aligns with the third school of thought, believing that the world has been created millions of times every second and will continue to do so by itself.
* Modern science supports a gradual cooling earth leading to life in the ocean, while Buddhism emphasizes the cyclical nature of world systems appearing, changing, decaying, and disappearing.

#### Other World Systems

* The Buddha occasionally commented on other-world systems, mentioning 31 planes of existence within universes: 4 unhappy realms, 1 human world, 6 heavenly realms, 16 fine-material realms, and 4 formless realms.
* Modern science is exploring the possibility of life on other planets, given the vastness of the universe.
* The Buddha emphasized the limitations of human perception and the possibility of other world systems beyond our current understanding.
* Buddhists believe in the continuous cycle of creation and destruction of universes, with no absolute beginning or end.



# The Buddhist Concept Of Heaven And Hell
* Buddhists believe that heaven and hell are temporary states of existence determined by one's karma.
* There are no eternal punishments or rewards, and individuals can work their way out of hell through merit accumulated in past lives.
* Suffering is the defining characteristic of hell, while pleasure defines heaven. Both states exist both within this world and beyond.

# Belief In Deities (*Devas*)
* Buddhists acknowledge the existence of deities but do not consider them essential for salvation.
* Deities are also subject to rebirth and have limited powers.
* While some Buddhists may offer prayers or make offerings to deities, these practices are not considered necessary for attaining Nirvana.

# Existence Of Spirits
* Buddhism does not deny the existence of spirits, both good and evil.
* These spirits are also subject to birth and death and can be influenced by one's actions.
* A virtuous life is the best protection against evil spirits.

# The Significance Of Transference Of Merits To The Departed
* Buddhists believe that performing good deeds generates merit which can be transferred to others, both living and deceased.
* This transfer can be done through a simple wish or expression of intent.
* The beneficiary's awareness and joy in the deed enhance the merit shared.

# The Buddha's Teachings on Transferring Merits

* The greatest gift for ancestors is performing 'acts of merit' and transferring these merits to them.
* Those who give also receive the fruits of their deeds.
* Alms should be given in the name of the departed, recalling their kindness and relationship.

# Transferring Merits: Belief System

*  Belief that after death, 'merits' and 'demerits' are weighed to determine destiny.
* Those with more good deeds are reborn in a happy place; those with fewer may be reborn in a realm of woe.
* Departed ones in lower spirit forms cannot generate fresh merits and rely on those from the living.

# Helping the Departed

* Those who lived virtuously likely have a chance at rebirth in a happy place and don't require help.
* Those without this chance need merit transfers to offset their deficiency and achieve happiness.
* Remembering the departed with good deeds brings them happiness, relieving suffering and potentially transforming their birth.

# Rituals and Practices

* Transferring merits is similar to Hindu customs of honoring ancestors.
* Buddhists remember the dead when doing good deeds, especially on anniversaries.
* A ritual involves pouring water while reciting a Pali formula symbolizing the transfer of merit.

# Understanding Merit Transfer

* The meaning and practice of merit transfer are often misunderstood.
* Some engage in meaningless ceremonies instead of focusing on genuine acts of merit.

# True Ways to Help

* Building elaborate tombs or burning offerings does not help the departed.
* True help comes from performing meritorious deeds like giving alms, building schools or hospitals, and printing religious books.

# Buddhist Approach

* Buddhists directly radiate loving-kindness to the departed instead of praying to gods.
* Transferring merit through good deeds is the best way to honor and remember them.
* The departed reciprocate blessings upon their living relatives.

### 17. DIVINATION AND DREAMS

* Astrology is concerned with the relationship between celestial movements and human destiny.
* Astronomy is a pure science focused on studying celestial objects and their movements.
* Buddhism doesn't explicitly endorse or reject astrology, focusing instead on spiritual development.

#### Astrology And Astronomy

* Astronomy studies celestial objects and phenomena scientifically.
* Astrology explores the supposed influence of celestial bodies on human affairs.
* The Buddha recognized the vastness and interconnectedness of the universe but emphasized personal responsibility over astrological predictions.

##### Buddhist Attitude Towards Astrology

* Buddhism accepts that cosmic energy interacts with individual karma, influencing life's course.
* Astrologers believe birth time is predetermined by cosmic and karmic energies.
* While astrology can offer insights into tendencies, Buddhism emphasizes the power of mental development to transcend karmic influences and achieve liberation.

# Astrology

* Astrology cannot solve all your problems, it only shows aspects of your life and character.
* You must adjust your way of life based on astrological insights.
* Beware of fake astrologers who tell you what you want to hear instead of the truth.

# Fortune-Telling And Charms

* Hard work is the luckiest star.
* Buddhism does not encourage fortune-telling or charms, as they have no spiritual value.
* Relying on external sources like stars or charms is less effective than self-effort.
* Some people attribute illness and misfortune to charms, but modern science offers explanations for these issues.

# Consulting Mediums

* Consulting mediums is a traditional belief for psychological relief, not a Buddhist practice.
* Buddhists are non-committal about the validity of mediumship.
* If mediums provide solace without harming others, Buddhists do not object.
* Understanding and practicing Buddhist teachings allows one to overcome problems without needing mediums.

# Dreams And Their Significance

* Dreams remain a mystery, with various interpretations throughout history.
* Buddhism considers dreams as ideational processes occurring during light slumber.
* Six causes of dreams are identified: organic factors, supernatural intervention, past experiences, future influences, and two types related to subconscious thoughts and external stimuli.
* Only prophetic dreams hold significance according to Buddhist teachings.
* Most dreams reflect the mind at rest and have no prophetic value.

# Prophetic Dreams

* These dreams are rare and only occur when a significant event is about to happen to the dreamer.
* Buddhists believe that devas (spirits) can communicate through dreams to warn or prepare us for important events.
* These messages are symbolic and require interpretation.
* It's crucial not to confuse prophetic dreams with other types, as this can lead to exploitation by fake mediums.

# Dreams and Karma

* Our minds store karmic energies from past actions.
* Sometimes, when karma is about to ripen (produce its result), a dream may occur reflecting the impending event.
* These dreams are rare and only happen to people with specific mental makeups.

# Telepathic Dreams

* Two people can communicate through dreams if one strongly desires to connect with the other.
* This involves sending telepathic messages during sleep, which are received as dreams by the recipient.
* These dreams are usually brief because the human mind isn't strong enough for sustained telepathy.

# The Dream World and Reality

* Everyone experiences a dream-like state in daily life, mistaking impermanence for permanence.
* Only Buddhas and arahants (enlightened beings) are truly awake to reality and don't dream.

# Faith Healing

* Faith healing relies on psychological techniques to activate the immune system.
* Some faith healers use religion as a tool to enhance patient belief, but religion is not essential for faith healing.
* Hypnosis is an example of faith healing without religious elements.
* Conditioning the mind through practices like meditation can positively influence physical and mental well-being.

# Superstitions And Dogmas

* Superstitions are harmful beliefs that lack evidence and can be difficult to overcome.
* Religions sometimes adopt superstitious rituals, which can overshadow their core tenets.
* Dogmatic beliefs lead to intolerance and have historically caused violence and persecution.
* Scientific knowledge helps dispel superstitions, but emotional attachment to them can persist.
* True religious understanding involves freeing oneself from superstition and dogma.
