# Language, Conscious Experience And The Self In Early Buddhism A Cross-Cultural Interdisciplinary Study

* This article examines early Buddhist ideas about language, conscious experience and the self.
* It focuses on the concept of *saññā* (apperception) and its connection to language.
* It explores how *saññā* contributes to the notion of Self (*attā*) as "being," speaker, and experiencer.

# Introduction

* Recent research suggests early Buddhism was more sophisticated than previously thought.
* The article argues that understanding early Buddhist concepts requires considering their philosophical background.
* Early Buddhist ideas about language's role in cognition are central to this study.

# Methodological Remarks: The Value Of Cross-Cultural Interdisciplinary Approach

* Reconstructing early Buddhist doctrine is complex and requires a multi-faceted approach.
* A cross-cultural, interdisciplinary approach can help make sense of difficult concepts.
* Comparing early Buddhism with other philosophical traditions (both Eastern and Western) can provide valuable insights.
* Cognitive science offers a new perspective on understanding human psychology, which aligns with Buddhist teachings.
* This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of early Buddhist thought.

## It will be claimed here that it is only when viewed against such a backdrop that the problematic ideas make full sense.

* Philological analysis may perhaps allow us to elucidate their meaning further and explain what at irst sight appear to be irreconcilable discrepancies.
* The price for such a deconstruction will be relatively small, requiring one to consider certain later developments and interpretations belonging to the commentarial tradition of Theravāda as inadequate.

## 42 The "World" In The Fathom-Long Body

* Several early Buddhist texts contain a speciic idea of the "world" (*loko*) deined in terms of elements constituting the human cognitive apparatus and their respective objects.
* According to these texts, the world is situated in the fathom-long body (*kaḷevare*) which is endowed with perception and mind/intellect (sasaññimhi samanake).

* The *Rohitassa Sutta* speaks about this "world" situated in the fathom-long body.
* The *Lokantagamana Sutta* states that "In the discipline of the noble one, that is called 'world' (*loka*) by which in the world (*lokasmiṃ*) one comes to perceive the world (*lokasaññī*) and […]is thinking oneself to be the world (*lokamānī*)".

* The peculiarity of this idea has been noticed by scholars like Ñāṇananda, Katz, Harvey, Hamilton, Waldron, and Wynne.
* They have pointed out that what is meant by 'world' in this context is not an independent domain of physical entities but the 'phenomenal world of perception' (*lokasaṃjñā*) that depends on the conceptual and proliferating activities of the mind.

* This does not imply metaphysical idealism, only the impossibility of experiencing and expressing the world without the medium of cognitive and linguistic factors.
* The very possibility of the world or its concept is provided by the functioning of cognitive and linguistic factors.

* Examining parallel versions of Pāli texts can be valuable in understanding these unusual statements.
* The *Rohitassa Sutta* has Chinese parallels at SĀ 1307/ T 99.1307 and in SĀ 2 306/T 100.306.

* These parallel versions differ with respect to the crucial phrase: byāmamatte kaḷevare sasaññimhi samanake.
* The difference regarding the same aspect can also be found in the parallel version to the *Lokantagamana Sutta*, the SĀ 234/ T ii 056c12.

* Our suspicion is conirmed by examination of the surviving fragment of the Sanskrit original from the Turfan mound SHT 6 1404 + 1411 (Vorl.nr x 318+x345).
* Grammatically the Chinese text generally corresponds to the Pāli version.

* These texts speak not only of the subjective world of human conscious experience but of the world of human language as well.
* The Nikāyas seems to suggest that supposedly objective elements of reality cannot be separated from their subjective experience and linguistic concepts, almost to the point of considering them synonymous.





## Apperception And Language

* The term *saññā*  is complex and difficult to translate accurately. Scholars have offered various renderings, including "idea," "cognition," "ideation," and "apperception."
* The Pāli term *saññā* is often translated as "thought" or "conception" in English.

* Chinese 想 (*xiàng*) is a good choice for translating *saññā* because it carries a strong subjective tone, reflecting the conceptually mediated nature of experience.

*  The Āgamas use 相 (*xiàng*) to correspond to Pāli *nimitta*, the main characteristic feature of an object apprehended by *saññā*.
* Sue Hamilton provides a detailed analysis of *saññā*, defining it as the process of apperceiving and conceptualizing.

*  *Saññā* can be a point of vulnerability in the cognitive process, prone to distortion and delusion.

* Terms like *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā* refer to negative cognitive processes that entangle beings in suffering.
* These terms highlight the role of language in shaping cognitive distortions.

* Ñāṇananda emphasizes the connection between *papañcasaññāsaṅkhā* and language, noting how linguistic conventions can lead to investing concepts like "I" with objective character.

* Hamilton draws on both Western and Eastern philosophy to explain how early Buddhist teachings show experience as mediated and constructed by cognitive and linguistic factors.
* She suggests that *papañceti* should be translated as "one causes to become manifold," leading to the attribution of independent existence to things and oneself.

* Language brings with it a multiplicity of names, sharp delineations, and the reification of experience.

* The *Nibbedhika Sutta* states that *saññā* results in expression in common language.
* The *Addhā Sutta* and *Samiddhi Sutta* suggest that beings perceive in terms of what can be expressed and become captured by death due to a lack of complete understanding of language.

* Liberation is described as the non-establishment of consciousness, implying a transcendence of linguistic constructs.

* The *Nāma Sutta* states that name conquers all and has everything under its power, highlighting the pervasive influence of language.

## Language And Its Misuse: A Cross-Cultural Perspective

* This text explores the relationship between language and perception, drawing parallels between early Buddhist thought and the work of philosophers like Wittgenstein, Sapir, and Whorf. 
* It argues that language shapes our understanding of the world and can lead to cognitive distortions, particularly the illusion of a separate self.

## Linguistic Relativism

* Sapir and Whorf are associated with linguistic relativism, which suggests that different languages lead to different perceptions of reality.
* While this idea has been debated, there is some evidence to suggest that language can influence perception in subtle ways.

## Language and Cognition

* Wittgenstein, Sapir, and Whorf all believed that language plays a fundamental role in shaping our thoughts and cognitive processes.
* This view aligns with early Buddhist thought, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of language, mind, and reality.

## The Self-Delusion

* According to early Buddhism, the illusion of a separate self is a major source of suffering.
* Wittgenstein also argued that language can contribute to this delusion by creating false dichotomies and reinforcing our sense of ego.

## The Role of Saññā

* In Buddhist thought, *saññā* refers to perception or conceptualization.
* This text argues that *saññā* is shaped by language and can lead to cognitive distortions.

## Language as a Tool

* Wittgenstein's later philosophy emphasized the pragmatic nature of language.
* He argued that language is a tool for communication and social interaction, rather than a mirror of reality.

## The Limitations of Language

* Both early Buddhism and Wittgenstein recognized the limitations of language in capturing the full complexity of reality.
* They argued that language can only provide an incomplete and potentially misleading representation of the world.




## 55 Self And The Narrative

* The tendency to seek objective correlates of language elements is natural.
* This can lead to hypostatization, where language elements are seen as having inherent reality.
* The Abhidhamma system exemplifies this by seeing language as isomorphic with reality.
* Western metaphysics also shows this tendency, with nouns representing substances and adjectives representing forms.
* In Theravada Buddhism, Pali was considered a holy language, with some words believed to have arisen spontaneously.

## This Stage Is Described By

* The *Sabbāsava Sutta* describes how unwise mental attention leads to self-reflexive thinking about past, present, and future.
* This involves questions like "Was I?", "What was I?", and "Will I be?".
* It culminates in the belief in a permanent, unchanging Self that experiences the results of actions.

## The Process Starts With

* A simple search for an objectively existing correlate of the personal pronoun "I".
* The introduction of the notion of "Self" existing in past, present, and future.
* This creates an illusion of continuity by projecting Self beyond the present moment.

## According To The Sabbāsava Sutta

* Inner speech plays a crucial role in developing self-delusion.
* While inner speech initially served a neutral and pragmatic function, it can become distorted.


## Concepts Of The Narrative Self

* Emile Benveniste argued that language constitutes the "Self" through the establishment of subjectivity.
* He emphasized the dualistic relationship between "I" and "you/that".
* Other scholars like Madison developed the concept further, seeing "Self" as a product of ongoing narrative.
* Cognitive science also arrives at similar conclusions, with Dennett speaking of "Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity".

## The Intrusion Of Language

* Language can warp our experience of reality by hypostatizing grammatical structures.
* This leads to the perception of distinct entities existing in time.
* Language facilitates the introduction of "Self" as a narrative protagonist, contrasting with "non-Self".

## According To The Sabbāsava Sutta

* The final step of cognitive delusion involves the introduction of a Subject who experiences the results of actions.
* This raises the question: if autobiographical Self doesn't exist, who undergoes delusion?

## Reductionism, Khandha-S And The Human Being

* Walpola Rahula poses the question: If there is no Self, who realizes Nirvana?
* Buddhist literature often answers that a person is a set of five *khandha-s* in constant flux.
* This theory has limitations as the five *khandha-s* were not meant to be a comprehensive analysis of a human being but rather an experiential understanding of a person's phenomenal nature.
* A reductionist account of a human being as five *khandha-s* fails to explain how it functions.

## Conscious Experience And Its Misinterpretation: A Perspective From Cognitive Science

* The five *khandha-s* represent aspects of subjective, conscious experience.
* Taking them to be Self implies that a person considers their conscious experience to be the seat of true subjectivity and agency. 
* Modern cognitive science suggests that consciousness is not the "place" where thinking, cognizing, and decision making occur.
* Higher-level information processing occurs simultaneously on multiple parallel levels, much of it unconsciously.
* Consciousness integrates non-conscious processing into a coherent Self-narrative.

* Cognitive models like Global Workspace Theory (GWT) describe consciousness as a global workspace where information becomes available to the whole system.
* GWT contrasts with reductionistic Abhidhammic theories which fail to explain crucial aspects of human cognition, such as multiple forms of consciousness operating simultaneously. 
* There is a distinction between actual cognitive processing and conscious awareness.

* Thoughts, ideas, and insights originate unconsciously and then become consciously accessible.
* Acts of will also originate unconsciously, with conscious awareness providing a feeling of agency after the decision has been made.

# Consciousness and Agency

* Consciousness is not the source of ideas, will, or cognition.
* We only have access to the content of phenomenal consciousness, not the underlying processes.
* Phenomenal consciousness acts as a limited and distorted mirror reflecting our activities.
* This reflection is shaped by conceptual and linguistic factors, leading to a misinterpretation of our true nature.

# The Delusion of Self

* The sense of self arises from identifying with a mental entity that appears to control the body.
* This is a delusion because agency and subjectivity actually reside in the sentient body.
* The term "individual" is a linguistic construct, as there are no fixed boundaries between ourselves and our environment.

# Early Buddhist Perspectives

*  Early Buddhist texts describe experience through *khandha*-s (elements constituting our phenomenal world).
* These *khandha*-s are impermanent and dynamic, but can be mistakenly perceived as the Self due to unwise application of the mind (*ayoniso manasikaroto*).
* This misidentification is facilitated by "linguistication" of experience.

# Beyond the Khandhas

* Early Buddhist texts suggest modes of cognition that go beyond the *khandha*-s, using the concept of *citta*.
* Awakened individuals (Tathāgatas) are described as dwelling free from all five *khandha*-s and possessing a different mode of cognition (*abhijānāti*).

# The Sentient Body

* Early Buddhist texts emphasize a holistic view of the human being, often described as a sentient body (*kāya*) experiencing through six senses.
* The phrase "conscious/sentient body" (*saviññāṇaka kāya*) implies that the body is inherently sentient, not dualistic.




## Self-Consciousness, Psychological Time And Suffering

* Self-delusion leads to identifying with a false "Self," causing suffering.
* Constant inner speech maintains this illusionary Self.
* Early Buddhist texts equate ordinary experience with suffering due to Self-consciousness.

## Self-Reflexive Consciousness and Psychological Time

* Self-reflexive consciousness is linked to the subjective awareness of psychological time.
* This connection has been explored by scholars using a phenomenological approach.
* Zahavi argues that inner time-consciousness unifies the stream of consciousness, creating our sense of duration.

## Self-Reflexive Consciousness and Suffering

* Self-reflexive consciousness and psychological time are correlated with suffering.
* During suffering, time seems to drag on, while "Self" is strongly present.
* Happiness weakens the sense of "Self" and the passage of time.

## The Nature of Pleasure

* Misunderstanding pleasure stems from thinking we are a "Self."
* We try to relive pleasurable moments through Self-consciousness, leading to failure.
* True pleasure lies in the absence of Self-awareness.

## Absorption and Memory

* Bronkhorst suggests absorption is pleasurable due to reduced bodily tension.
* This aligns with the idea that lack of self-reflexive consciousness relieves strain.
* Absorption lacks memory traces because it doesn't involve declarative, self-reflexive conscious experience.

## Self-Delusion as a Virus

* Self-delusion can be seen as a "virus" infecting our cognitive system.
* This vulnerability may be an evolutionary adaptation that enhances competitiveness.
* Removing this "virus" could lead to a more natural way of being, free from self-inflicted suffering.
