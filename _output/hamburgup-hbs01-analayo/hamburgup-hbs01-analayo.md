* Understanding Buddhism is important in multicultural societies.

# About This Publication

* This book investigates the genesis of the bodhisattva ideal by Venerable Bhikkhu Anālayo.
* It analyzes early discourses from Pāli and Chinese sources.
* The author argues that compassion was not a motivating force for the Buddha's quest for awakening in these early sources.
* He examines the only reference to Maitreya in the Pāli canon, suggesting it is a later addition.

# Theme

* This book explores the origins of the bodhisattva ideal in early Buddhist discourses.
* It examines passages related to the bodhisattva conception, the meeting between Gautama and Kāśyapa, and the prediction of Maitreya's buddhahood. 




## Sources

* Early discourses are found in the four main Pāli *Nikāya*s, Dhammapada, Udā*na, Itivuttaka*, and *Sutta-nipāta*.
* These have counterparts in Sanskrit fragments and Chinese Ā*gama*s.
* This corpus of early discourses is likely the earliest layer of Buddhist textual activity.

## Acknowledgement

* The study originated from articles intended for independent publication.
* Several scholars provided valuable suggestions during various stages of the work.
* The author acknowledges their contributions but remains solely responsible for any errors or omissions.
* Lack of Japanese language knowledge prevented consideration of research published in that language.

## 1.1 Gautama'S Progress To Awakening

* The term *bodhisatta* is used by the Buddha Gautama to refer to his pre-awakening experiences.
* This usage occurs in a standard phrase indicating events before awakening, when he was "the bodhisattva".
* Sarvāstivāda texts do not use the term *bodhisattva* in this context, possibly showing greater respect for the Buddha.
* Pāli discourses often replace *bodhisatta* with terms like 'Blessed One' or 'Buddha' even when referring to the pre-awakening period.

* The bodhisattva Gautama's progress is described through three main themes:
    * Overcoming unwholesome states of mind (fear, sensuality).
    * Development of mental tranquillity and meditative absorption (*dhyāna*).
    * Growth of insight into dependent arising, feelings, elements, aggregates, senses, and the world.

* These descriptions align with standard accounts of an arhat's progress towards awakening.
* The term *bodhisattva* in these passages presents Gautama as "in search of awakening".

## 1.2 Gautama'S Motivation

* The 'before awakening' phrase in some discourses relates to Gautama's going forth, suggesting household life wasn't conducive to achieving liberation.
* The *Ariyapariyesanā-sutta* and its parallel reveal Gautama's motivation was to find a solution for his own suffering from old age and death, not out of concern for others.

* After awakening, the Buddha initially hesitated to teach due to the difficulty of conveying profound truths to those with defilements.
* This reluctance suggests that the Buddha's primary focus remained on himself even after achieving enlightenment.
* Compassion emerges as a quality inherent in the Buddha's awakened state and motivates him to teach.

##  Compassion and Teaching Activity

* Early Buddhist discourses depict compassion for others as a result of awakening, both for the Buddha and arhats.
* Arhats are expected to teach others and show concern for their well-being.
* Neglecting teaching duties is seen as obstructing progress on the path to liberation.
* Attaining liberation while teaching others is possible according to early discourses.

## Bodhisattva Motivation in Early Buddhist Thought

* Compassion was not a central motivator for Gautama's quest for awakening, unlike the emphasis on compassion in later Mahayana texts.
* This lack of prominence given to compassion in the bodhisattva's motivation extends beyond early discourses and is also observed in texts like the *Mahāvastu*.

## 1.3 Gautama'S Marvellous Qualities

* The discourse focuses on various qualities of the bodhisattva, rather than compassion.
* Two versions exist: the *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* (Pāli) and its *Madhyama-āgama* parallel.
* Both versions emphasize the marvellous nature of the Buddha's birth and early life.

##  The Differences Between the Two Versions

* The Pāli version mentions mindfulness and clear comprehension during Gautama's time in Tuṣita, while the Chinese version highlights his superiority to other heavenly beings.
* Both agree on Gautama entering his mother's womb with clear comprehension, but differ in details about his sojourn there.
*  The Pāli version describes the mother's death seven days after birth and a declaration by the newborn bodhisattva, absent in the Chinese version.

## Function of Listing Marvellous Qualities

* Both versions emphasize memorization by stating that Ānanda keeps each marvel in mind.
* This repetition highlights the importance of remembering these qualities.
* The emphasis on memorization could be due to the late inclusion of these sections in the oral tradition.




# Visual Stimulants

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* uses visual stimulants like earthquakes accompanied by intense light to symbolize the dispelling of darkness through Buddha's teachings.
* These images are framed within a meditation context, highlighting the bodhisattva's mindfulness and clear comprehension.
* The discourse follows a circular pattern that moves from the bodhisattva's clear comprehension to descriptions of jewels and great lights, ultimately returning to the Buddha's clear comprehension.

# Purpose of the Discourse

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* aims to evoke memories and visualizations of the Buddha's marvelous qualities.
* This was particularly important for new converts who had never met the Buddha, allowing them to connect with him emotionally through memorization and visualization.

# Addressing Needs

* By depicting common events like pregnancy and birth in a miraculous light, the *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* addresses the need for inspiration and emotional connection with the Buddha.
* It elevates these experiences by showcasing the bodhisattva's extraordinary nature, bridging the gap between the ordinary and the divine.

# Function of Marvels

* The marvels in Buddhist texts served to strengthen devotion based on the superior nature of the Buddha.
* They were considered important enough to be included as a distinct category ("limb" or "aṅga") within the canon.

# Evolution of the Bodhisattva Concept

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta*'s description of the bodhisattva's proclamation at birth marks a significant development in the concept of the bodhisattva.
* This proclamation emphasizes his supreme status and his mission to liberate all beings from suffering.





# The *Madhyama-āgama* Version

* Only records the seven steps without any proclamation.
* Nakamura suggests that the verse claimed to have been proclaimed by the Buddha at his birth was composed late.

#  Variations in Proclamation Content

* A range of sources record a proclamation made by the newly-born bodhisattva Gautama, but with variations in content.
* Variations also exist in the proclamation made by the former Buddha Vipaśyī after being born.

# Didactic Function and Consequences

* The proclamation made by the bodhisattva Gautama may have initially been another facet of exalting the Buddha.
* This marvel has consequences that were likely unintended.

# Significance in Relation to Early Discourses

* Early Buddhist discourses generally indicate that the bodhisattva was not yet awakened at birth.
* The claim of this being one's last birth is typically made after reaching full awakening.

# Shift in Conception of the Bodhisattva

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* presents a shift, claiming the bodhisattva knew this was his last birth from infancy.
* This contrasts with earlier passages where the bodhisattva struggled with defilements and wasn't yet supreme.

# Temporal Expansion of 'Bodhisattva'

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* uses "bodhisattva" for the Buddha's previous life in Tuṣita, while earlier discourses only used it for his last human life.
* This implies the bodhisattva was destined to become a Buddha from birth.

# Destined Success and Birthright Superiority

* The *Aṅguttara-nikāya* lists five dreams of the bodhisattva as portents of his future success.
* This suggests his quest for awakening was predetermined to succeed.
* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* reflects a change where the bodhisattva's superiority becomes a birthright.

# Other Texts Endowing Bodhisattva with Buddha-like Qualities

* The *Saṅghabhedavastu*, *Divyāvadāna*, and *Mahāvastu* attribute qualities typically attained at awakening to the bodhisattva from birth or previous lives.
* The *Mahāpadā*nasutta* suggests former Buddha Vipaśyī also possessed the divine eye at birth.

# Lineage of Former Buddhas

* This leads to an examination of the lineage of former Buddhas described in the *Mahāpadā*nasutta*.

## 1.4 The Lineage Of Former Buddhas

* The *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta*'s description of a bodhisattva's qualities is mirrored in the *Mahāpadāna-sutta*'s depiction of previous Buddhas before awakening.
* This suggests that an earlier account of 'prince' Vipaśyī was expanded to include marvels from a discourse like the *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta*.
* The *Mahāpadāna-sutta* presents the bodhisattva concept generically, applying it to all Buddhas who came before.

* This reflects an increasing interest in the lineage of former Buddhas, possibly to authenticate the Buddha's message.
* Applying the marvels to previous Buddhas makes these qualities expected for anyone on the path to Buddhahood.
* This marks a step towards the bodhisattva concept becoming an ideal to emulate.

* The *Mahāpadāna-sutta* doesn't depict a direct relationship between a bodhisattva and a former Buddha.
* However, proclaiming superiority becomes a birthright of a bodhisattva in their last life.
* This sense of superiority pervades later developments of the bodhisattva concept.

* In the Mahāvastu, future bodhisattvas seem more influenced by the Buddha's glory than suffering.
* Early Mahāyāna discourses highlight becoming the highest being in the universe as a stimulus for pursuing the bodhisattva path.
* Some Mahāyāna texts portray the bodhisattva ideal as aspiring to cosmic sovereignty and power represented by complete Buddhahood. 




## Summary

* **Summary**
    * The chapter explores the development of the bodhisattva concept in early Buddhist discourses.
    * Initially, Gautama's focus was on personal liberation, with compassion arising after his awakening.
    * His death created a need to emphasize his qualities and lineage, leading to the *Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta* and *Mahāpadāna-sutta*.
    * These texts established the bodhisattva's exceptional nature, paving the way for the ideal's development.

* **The Bodhisattva Notion**
    * The chapter focuses on the vow taken by a bodhisattva to achieve Buddhahood.
    * It examines the tale of Gautama meeting the previous Buddha Kāśyapa as a key example.

* **The Tale of Gautama and Kāśyapa**
    *  The chapter provides background on the *jātaka* genre, analyzes discourses recounting the meeting, and explores its nature as a *jātaka*.




## 2.1 The Jātaka Genre

* The development of the bodhisattva conception led to increased interest in the *jātaka*s, which are records of the bodhisattva's experiences and struggles during his path to becoming a Buddha.

* *Jātaka*s often integrate ancient Indian fables, anecdotes, and parables, identifying one protagonist (usually heroic) with the Buddha in a past life.
* Examples include versions of the Rāmāyaṇa and tales of a quail, dice players, a flying horse, and a harmonious trio of a bird, monkey, and elephant.

* Some *jātaka*s originated as parables found in early discourses and the *Vinaya*, later being adapted to feature the bodhisattva.
* Variations exist across different Buddhist traditions regarding which character in a tale is identified with the bodhisattva, suggesting that these identifications were added later.




# Yet another *Vinaya* case is concerned with the topic of patience. 
- A dispute broke out among monks in Kauśāmbī regarding proper conduct.
- The Buddha told a story about a prince who sought revenge but chose forgiveness.

# Versions of this story in various Buddhist texts.
- The tale appears in different forms across Madhyama-ā*gama*, *Ekottarika-āgama*, and Chinese *Udāna* collections, as well as Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, and Theravāda *Vinaya*s.

# The Pāli Jā*taka* collection identifies the prince with the bodhisattva.
- A Chinese *Jātaka* collection identifies the prince's father as the bodhisattva, suggesting the prince was Ānanda in a past life.

# Disagreement on Bodhisattva Identification
- The differing identifications and lack of identification in other versions suggest the tale may not have originally been a jātaka.

# Another Example: The Tale of an Ox
- This story, found in the Theravāda *Vinaya*, concerns an ox refusing to perform a task due to being insulted by its owner.
- The Buddha used this tale to discourage monks from abusing each other.

# Implicit Bodhisattva Identification
- The Theravāda *Vinaya*'s conclusion implicitly identifies the ox as the bodhisattva in a past life, aligning with the Pāli jā*taka* version.

# Variations Across Texts
- Other *Vinaya*s and a Chinese *Udāna* collection do not explicitly identify the ox as the bodhisattva.


# The Logic Behind Jātaka Formation
- Some tales may have become jātakas through the assumption that the Buddha drew on past lives for his teachings.

# Kūṭ*adanta-sutta* Example
- This sutra describes a grand sacrifice, and the Buddha confirms he witnessed it himself.
- This supports the idea that tales without explicit source attribution could be from the Buddha's past lives.

# Variations in Bodhisattva Identification
- The Kūṭ*adanta-sutta* also exemplifies this pattern, with different versions identifying the bodhisattva as either the Brahmin chaplain or the king who organized the sacrifice.

# Ambiguity in Some Cases
- Some tales lack clear identification of the bodhisattva, making it uncertain if they were originally jātakas.

# The Story of Brahmin Mahāgovinda
- In some versions, the Buddha identifies this tale as a past life experience, while others do not.

# Other Examples of Ambiguity
- The *Velāma-sutta* also shows variations in whether the Brahmin's story is presented as a past life of the Buddha.

# Conclusion
- While some cases clearly show parables becoming jātakas through bodhisattva identification, ambiguity persists in others.

## 2.2 Gautama Meets Kāśyapa

* The meeting between Gautama and Kāśyapa takes place when Gautama's Buddhahood is near.
* The story is recorded in the *Ghāṭīkāra-sutta* of the *Majjhima-nikāya* and the *Madhyama-āgama*.
* Parallels can be found in other Buddhist texts like the *Mahāvastu*, *Saṅghabhedavastu*, and a Chinese *Avadāna* collection.

## The Tale

* The Buddha smiles, prompting Ananda to ask about the reason.
* The Buddha tells a story of two friends, a potter and a young Brahmin, during the time of Buddha Kāśyapa.
* The Brahmin refuses to see Kāśyapa, using derogatory terms to describe him.
* The potter repeatedly invites the Brahmin, eventually physically compelling him to go.
* The Brahmin hears a discourse from Kāśyapa and decides to become a monk.

##  The Potter and the King

* The scene shifts to Vārāṇasī where King visits Kāśyapa.
* Kāśyapa declines the king's invitation to stay for the rains retreat.
* When asked about another supporter, Kāśyapa praises the potter for his virtuous conduct and insight into the four noble truths.
* Kāśyapa recounts how the potter reacted with joy when he took food from his house and used his workshop materials.
* The king decides to send food supplies to the potter, but the potter politely declines.

##  Purpose of the Tale

* The tale contrasts the potter and the king, highlighting the potter's superior virtue as a lay supporter.
* The potter is depicted as an ideal lay disciple with deep devotion to Buddha Kāśyapa.
* The story emphasizes how this exemplary follower convinces even a reluctant Brahmin to visit the Buddha. 




## 2.3 The Meeting With Kāśyapa As A Jātaka6 5

* The *Ghāṭīkāra-sutta* and its parallels identify a young Brahmin with Buddha Gautama in one of his former lives.
* This identification is challenged by a passage in the *Ekottarika-āgama*, which suggests the young Brahmin lived at the time of Buddha Kāśyapa, not as a bodhisattva.

##  The Young Brahmin's Perspective

* The young Brahmin shows no interest in meeting Buddha Kāśyapa, contradicting the expected behavior of a bodhisattva encountering a Buddha.
* Tales of the bodhisattva Gautama show deep respect and faith towards Buddhas, unlike the reluctance displayed by the young Brahmin.
* The *Madhyama-āgama* version portrays the young Brahmin as easily convinced to visit Buddha Kāśyapa, which seems unlikely given the social context.

##  The Bodhisattva's Perspective

* The young Brahmin's disrespectful attitude towards Buddha Kāśyapa is problematic for a bodhisattva.
* Some texts explain the Buddha's six years of asceticism as karmic retribution for this disrespect.
* The *Kathāvatthu* questions how Gautama could claim to have no teacher if he was previously a disciple of Buddha Kāśyapa.

##  The Buddha's Awakening

* Gautama claimed to have realized what was "unheard before," contradicting the idea that he learned from Buddha Kāśyapa.
* The Buddha considered his awakening a rediscovery of an ancient path, suggesting independent realization rather than direct instruction.

## Conclusion

* The identification of the young Brahmin with the bodhisattva Gautama may be a later development.
* The absence of this encounter in the Pāli Jā*taka* collection supports this possibility.

# Absence from Jataka Collection

* This absence suggests the Ghaṭīkāra-sutta may not have been considered a jātaka initially.

# Gautama'S Vow Under Kāśyapa

* The Madhyama-āgama's Discourse on Marvellous Qualities mentions the bodhisattva Gautama taking his initial vow to become a Buddha under the Buddha Kāśyapa.
* This vow is repeated several times in the discourse, suggesting it may be a later addition.
* The inclusion of this vow aligns with the Madhyama-āgama's wider temporal frame, encompassing events before and after Gautama's birth.

# Shifting Timeline of Gautama's Vow

* Other texts associate Gautama's embarking on the quest for Buddhahood with a much earlier lifetime, even predating Kāśyapa.
* This suggests a gradual shift in the timeline of Gautama's vow, moving further into the past as his glorification increased.

# Stages of the Encounter with Kāśyapa

* Initially, the Ghaṭīkāra-sutta simply identifies Gautama as a young Brahmin who goes forth under Kāśyapa.
* Later, the Madhyama-āgama Discourse on Marvellous Qualities portrays this meeting as inspiring Gautama to take a vow to become a Buddha.
* Finally, in later texts, the encounter serves to confirm Gautama's impending Buddhahood, as his decision was already made much earlier.

# Rationale for the Vow

* The Ghaṭīkāra-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel offer little information about Gautama's conduct after going forth under Kāśyapa.
* This lack of inspiring details contrasts with the typical portrayal of bodhisattvas in jātakas.
* The focus on the potter's exemplary qualities further emphasizes Gautama's secondary role in this tale.

# The Ghaṭīkā*ra-sutta* and its Parallels

* Narrates a potter convincing a young Brahmin to visit Buddha Kāśyapa.
* The Brahmin decides to go forth, but the discourse doesn't detail his further actions.
* Originally might have been a didactic tale about an exemplary lay disciple.
* Tradition identifies the Brahmin as bodhisattva Gautama in a past life.

# The Problem of the Bodhisattva's Conduct under Kāśyapa

* The *Madhyama-āgama* Discourse on Marvellous Qualities offers a solution to the uninspiring account of the bodhisattva's conduct under Buddha Kāśyapa.
* It suggests that Gautama decided to pursue Buddhahood at that time, explaining his lack of further attainment.

# The Missing Piece: Prediction of Future Buddhahood

* Early discourses lack a record of Gautama receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.
* However, the *Madhyama-āgama* contains a discourse where Gautama predicts Maitreya's future Buddhahood.

# The Discourse on an Explanation about the Past

* Focuses on the prediction given by Gautama to an aspiring bodhisattva, assuring his future success as Buddha Maitreya.
* This chapter examines this discourse and its implications for the bodhisattva ideal.




## 3.1 Maitreya In The Discourse On The Wheel-Turning King

* Maitreya is a significant figure in Buddhism, serving as a future Buddha, teacher, and protector.
* He appears in early Buddhist discourses, notably the Discourse on the Wheel-turning King.
* This discourse exists in three versions: *Cakkavatti-(sīhanāda)-sutta* (*Dīgha-nikāya*), *Discourse on the Conduct of the Wheel-turning King* (*Dīrgha-āgama*), and *Discourse on the Wheel-turning King* (*Madhyamaāgama*).

## A) The Dīgha-Nikāya Version

* Describes a future time when a king named Saṅkha will rule with righteousness and prosperity.
* Introduces Maitreya as a future Buddha who will arise during this era.
* Details Maitreya's qualities: Arhat, Fully Awakened One, teacher of gods and humans, etc.
* Explains that Maitreya will teach the Dharma and establish a community of monks.
* Describes King Saṅkha renouncing his throne to become a monk under Maitreya's guidance.

* Emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and the Dharma as refuge for monks.
* Encourages monks to practice mindfulness and cultivate virtues like lifespan, beauty, happiness, wealth, and strength.

## B) The Dīrgha-Āgama Version23

* A Buddha named Maitreya will appear in the world when people live eighty thousand years. 
* He will teach the Dharma just as the current Buddha does.
* He will have a large community of disciples called "Sons of Maitri".
* King Śaṅkha, a wheel-turning king, will rule the world righteously and possess seven treasures.
* The king will build a jeweled pillar, destroy it, and offer it to those in need before becoming a monk.

* Monks should cultivate wholesome conduct for a longer lifespan, improved complexion, happiness, wealth, and strength.


## C) The Madhyama-Āgama Version31

* When people live eighty thousand years, King Śaṅkha will rule the world righteously with his fourfold army and possess seven treasures.
* He will have a thousand sons who are handsome, courageous, and fearless.
* He will rule through teaching Dharma, not force.
* Monks should emulate the king by keeping to their own resort (the monastic life) inherited from their forefathers.

* This will lead to a longer lifespan, improved complexion, happiness, and strength for monks. 


## 3.2 The Maitreya Episode In Comparative Perspective

* Comparing translated versions reveals variations in the placement of the Maitreya episode within the discourse.
* The *Madhyama-āgama* version lacks the episode entirely, likely due to an addition in other versions rather than intentional omission.

* The smooth transition in the *Madhyama-āgama* version towards the final advice suggests no text loss. 
* In contrast, the less smooth transitions in the *Dīgha-nikāya* and *Dīrgha-āgama* versions hint at a later addition of the Maitreya reference.

* The literal prediction of future events in the passage conflicts with the early Buddhist concept of dependent arising.
* Early Buddhist predictions are more akin to prognoses, allowing for free will and uncertainty.

* The description of the future wheel-turning king may be allegorical rather than a precise prediction.

* The *Madhyama-āgama* version emphasizes keeping to one's proper resort, illustrated by the wheel-turning king who adheres to tradition.
* This theme aligns with the purpose of encouraging monks to maintain mindfulness practice as their own resort.


* Maitreya plays no role in the final advice, suggesting his reference might be a later addition.

* The Discourse on the Wheel-turning King may have originally been a humorous parable without any mention of the future Buddha.

## 3.3 Maitreya In The Discourse On An Explanation About The Past

- This section discusses the appearance of Maitreya in the *Madhyama-āgama* discourse "Discourse on an Explanation about the Past."
-  The discourse begins with monks discussing the merits of giving alms to virtuous monks versus accumulating wealth.
- Anuruddha recounts a past life where he offered food to a Pratyekabuddha, leading to favorable rebirths.

- The Buddha, overhearing the conversation, proposes to tell a tale about the future.
- He narrates the story of a future wheel-turning king named Śaṅkha who will eventually attain liberation.
- A monk named Ajita expresses his aspiration to become King Śaṅkha, but the Buddha rebukes him for postponing enlightenment.

- The Buddha then describes Maitreya, under whom Śaṅkha will renounce the world.
- Another monk named Maitreya declares his aspiration to become the future Buddha Maitreya.
- The Buddha praises him and predicts his future Buddhahood, bestowing upon him a golden robe.


- Māra attempts to distract the monks with promises of worldly pleasures in King Śaṅkha's realm.

- The Buddha counters with verses praising the path to liberation under Maitreya.
- The discourse concludes with Māra's defeat and the monks' joy.

##  Evolution of the Discourse

- This section analyzes the development of the tale within the *Madhyama-āgama* collection.
- It compares the "Discourse on an Explanation about the Past" to other versions, like the "Discourse on the Wheel-turning King."
- The author suggests a three-stage evolution:

    - Stage 1: Focuses solely on the future realm of King Śaṅkha without mentioning Maitreya.
    - Stage 2: Introduces Maitreya's future advent alongside King Śaṅkha.
    - Stage 3: Features a monk aspiring to become the Buddha Maitreya, as seen in the "Discourse on an Explanation about the Past."

- The author proposes that the tale of Śaṅkha and Maitreya may have been added to the original discourse about Anuruddha's past life.



## Significance for the Bodhisattva Concept

- This section highlights the significance of the "Discourse on an Explanation about the Past" in the development of the bodhisattva concept.
- It notes that a monk expresses his aspiration to become a future Buddha, receiving a prediction from the Buddha.
- This marks a shift from a retrospective view of bodhisattvas (representing past experiences) to a forward-looking perspective.

- The author argues that this shift allows the bodhisattva ideal to become something others can aspire to.

## 3.4 The Prediction Of Maitreya

* The prediction given according to the Discourse on an Explanation about the Past by the Buddha Gautama describes Maitreya becoming a Buddha called Tathāgata Maitreya in the distant future.
* This prediction emphasizes that Maitreya will possess all the qualities and achievements of the present Buddha Gautama, including awakening, knowledge, conduct, and teaching Dharma.
* The text repeats this message eight times, emphasizing the central theme of Maitreya's future Buddhahood.

* The passage centers on the three refuges: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. It describes Maitreya as a bodhisattva who will become a Buddha, teach Dharma, and have a large following of monks.
* This prediction addresses the need for faithful Buddhists to connect with the three refuges after Gautama Buddha's passing.

* The prediction establishes Maitreya as a bodhisattva, implying he shares the qualities of all Buddhas and will reside in Tuṣita before becoming a Buddha.
* It provides assurance of continuity after Gautama Buddha's demise, offering hope for those who need guidance and progress towards awakening.




## Summary

**# Summary**

* A comparative study of the Discourse on the Wheel-turning King suggests that the earliest canonical reference to Maitreya, the future Buddha, was added later.
* The Madhyama-āgama's Discourse on an Explanation about the Past provides a more developed account of Maitreya's advent, with Gautama Buddha predicting his success.

**# The Genesis of the Bodhisattva Ideal**

* Passages depicting Gautama as a bodhisattva seeking awakening before becoming Buddha suggest the early development of the bodhisattva concept.
* The *Acchariyabbhutadhammasutta*'s exposition of marvels associated with Gautama's birth reflects a shift towards viewing the bodhisattva as inevitably destined for awakening.
* The *Mahāpadāna-sutta* and its parallels establish the notion that marvels are characteristic of all bodhisattvas destined for awakening.

**# Further Developments in the Bodhisattva Concept**

* The Discourse on Marvellous Qualities in the *Madhyama-āgama* ingeniously resolves the problem of Gautama's uninspiring past life meeting with a previous Buddha by introducing the idea that he vowed to become a Buddha at that meeting.
* This concept likely led to the prediction given to the future Buddha, as reflected in the Madhyama-āgama Discourse on an Explanation about the Past.

**# Key Ingredients of the Bodhisattva Ideal**

* The various strands of thought discussed – the generic notion of a bodhisattva, the inevitability of their awakening, the vow they take, and the prediction they receive – coalesce to form the basic ingredients of the bodhisattva ideal.
* The gradual apotheosis of the Buddha, evident in early discourses, seems to be a central factor behind these developments.

**# Practical Implications and Pan-Buddhist Phenomenon**


* Fujita's (2009) finding indicates the existence of renunciate bodhisattvas practicing within Nikāya Buddhism, suggesting a practical result of the above-mentioned development.
* Taking early discourses as a starting point explains why the bodhisattva ideal became pan-Buddhist, embraced by various schools, including Theravāda.

**# Conclusion**

* While the precise origins of the bodhisattva ideal remain elusive due to the limitations of textual records, this survey offers a new perspective and a viable hypothesis for its genesis.
* Further research is encouraged to refine these findings and shed more light on this important aspect of Buddhist thought.
