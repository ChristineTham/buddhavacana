# Introduction

* Commentaries traditionally follow and reflect the texts they explain, but Buddhist literature shows a more active role of exegesis in shaping scriptures.
* This study focuses on the interaction between the *Da zhidu lun* commentary and its base text, the Larger *Prajñāpāramitā*.

* The author's research revealed echoes of the *Da zhidu lun*'s explanations in later versions of the Larger *Prajñāpāramitā*.
* This monograph presents evidence of this interaction and discusses its implications for both texts.

* The *Da zhidu lun* is a highly influential text in East Asian Buddhism, with extensive scholarship on its thought, authorship, formation, and general aspects.

* This study adopts a historical-philological perspective, focusing on the *Da zhidu lun* as a commentary.
* The author's aims are to reconstruct aspects of the Larger *Prajñāpāramitā*'s history using the *Da zhidu lun* and explore some aspects of this important commentary.

* This work is not a comprehensive study of the *Da zhidu lun*, avoiding complex issues like authorship and philosophical orientation.
* The author hopes to contribute to our understanding of the *Da zhidu lun* and its base text, highlighting two main contributions:


    * New evidence on the *Da zhidu lun*'s historical background, including instances of its influence on Indian sources.

    * A close analysis of the exegesis in the *Da zhidu lun*, revealing a rich tradition of exegesis on *Prajñāpāramitā* texts.

## Outline

* **Chapter 1**
    * Argues that exegesis has contributed to the textual fluidity of many Mahāyāna *sūtra*s.
    * Uses the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā* as a case study.

* **Chapter 2**
    * Introduces the main sources used in the book:
        * The *Da zhidu lun*.
        * The Larger *Prajñāpāramitā* literature, including its various recensions and historical context.

* **Chapter 3 & Appendix 1**
    * Core research of the book.
    * Analyzes five passages from the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā*, showing how early exegesis in the *Da zhidu lun* influenced later readings.
    * Appendix 1 analyzes eleven more passages with similar patterns.

* **Chapter 4**
    * Discusses the implications of Chapter 3's findings for the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā*.
    * Argues that these texts were always open to exegetical influence.
    * Rejects the idea of a transition from an "unrevised" original to a "revised" version influenced by a specific commentary (Abhisamayālaṃkāra).
    * Suggests a gradual stabilization of the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā* texts between the fifth and seventh centuries CE, possibly reflecting wider institutionalization trends in Mahāyāna Buddhism.

* **Chapter 5**
    * Focuses on the nature of the *Da zhidu lun* as a commentary.
    * Discusses how exegesis and textual transmission interacted through this text.
    * Highlights the *Da zhidu lun*'s role as a repository of multiple interpretations.
    * Shows how it preserves fragments of earlier, otherwise unknown, exegetical traditions on *Prajñāpāramitā* texts.
    * Suggests that Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma compendia may have influenced the *Da zhidu lun*'s structure and methodology.

* **Chapter 6**
    * Discusses the broader religious implications of the study's findings.
    * Argues that the patterns observed point to a view of sacred scriptures as relatively "open" texts, informed by Buddhist ideas about *buddhavacana*.

* **Appendix 1**
    * Continues Chapter 3's analysis with eleven more examples of interaction between the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā* and its early exegesis.

* **Appendix 2**
    * Discusses the term "unhindered liberation" (*anāv*araṇavimokṣa*), which is important in the *Da zhidu lun* and features in one of the analyzed passages (Passage 4).

## 1 The Life And Growth Of Mahāyāna Sūtras

* Textual fluidity and recensional complexity are common features of Mahāyāna sūtra literature.

* Instead of a single Urtext, there are sets of teachings/ideas/narratives in parallel wordings, linked to a more or less compact but not univocally expressed Sūtra tradition.
* This is evident when comparing various witnesses of the "same" scripture (Sanskrit manuscripts, Chinese and Tibetan translations).

* The notion of "same" scripture becomes difficult to define conceptually.

* "Text" should be understood as dynamic and functional rather than substantial.

* It's preferable to use the notion of "scriptural (or textual) family": a set of textual instantiations characterized by complex patterns of relationship.
* This is similar to musical variations based on the same theme.

* Textual fluidity is magnified by the dimensions of the available textual tradition: the quantity and significance of variations correlate with the number of witnesses and their geographical and temporal distribution.

## Causes of Textual Variation

* Some scholars focus on the origins of textual transmission, critiquing notions like Urtext or archetype.
* Rejecting these notions is a healthy reaction against a classicist notion of text that has influenced modern scholarly understanding and editorial practices.

* Not all differences stem from original plurality of transmission lines.

* Another factor is variation of original readings during transmission.

* Careful comparative analysis can help infer early readings, especially when there's agreement among early witnesses.
* This allows identification of later developments based on those readings.

* Intentional diachronic variation, as opposed to aboriginal recensional differentiation, is the focus of this work.

* The aim is to discuss the formative process underlying intentional variation and analyze its causes.

## Types of Textual Variation

* Mahāyāna sūtras exhibit many types of textual variation.
* Performative nature and modular structure contribute to fluidity and diversity.
* Interpretation played a role: glosses sometimes became absorbed into the texts, modifying them.

* While there's a general tendency towards textual expansion, this is not a fixed rule.

* Example: A passage from Chapter Nine of the Sanskrit *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* shows how Xuanzang's translation contains significant additions not found in other witnesses.
* This likely reflects what he read in his original Indic manuscript.

# 20 On the textually developed nature of Xuanzang's *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* translation in general

* Lamotte (1962: 12) noted the textually developed nature of Xuanzang's *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* translation.
* Harrison noticed a similar tendency to textual expansion in Xuanzang's version of the Vajracchedikā prajñāpāramitā.
* Two possible interpretations for these expansions are: 1) Xuanzang's translations contained material present in inaccessible Indic versions, or 2) Xuanzang amplified the texts himself during translation.

# 2 The Larger Prajñāpāramitā And Its Earliest Surviving Commentary

* This chapter discusses a unique set of sources that provide insight into textual development processes.
* The *Da zhidu lun* (DZDL), a commentary on the *Larger Prajñāpāramitā*, offers a glimpse into this process.

# 2.1 Enter The Da Zhidu Lun

* The DZDL was translated into Chinese by Kumārajīva in the early fifth century CE.
* Only the first part of Kumārajīva's translation is complete, while the rest was abridged.
* The extant DZDL consists of two commentaries with different exegetical approaches.
* The authorship and nature of the DZDL are debated, but it is generally considered a translation of an Indic text.



## 2.2 The Larger Prajñāpāramitā Literature: An Overview

* This section discusses the Larger Prajñāpāramitā (LP) literature, a family of closely related texts varying in length.

* The classification of LP texts is complex and based on both quantitative (number of lines) and qualitative (textual affinities) criteria.
* A provisional classification focuses on textual content and wording, resulting in several recensions.

## 1. LPG Recension

* This recension is characterized by the relatively complete manuscript from Gilgit (LPG), dating to the early seventh century.

* Other texts belonging to this recension include:

    * The Sanskrit *Śatasāhasrikā* (*Ś*)
    * Incomplete Sanskrit manuscripts from Gilgit (LPG II and LPG III)
    * A fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript from Dunhuang
    * The Tibetan translation of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā (PvsP[TibPk])

* This recension is significant due to its early date and geographical spread.

## 2. PvsP Recension

* This recension is represented by the Sanskrit Pañcaviṃśati-sāhasrikā (*prajñāpāramitā*) (PvsP[K]), characterized by its structure based on the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra*.
* It is also referred to as the "Eight-Chaptered Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā" due to its division into eight main sections.

* Fragments from Sri Lanka, including gold leaves from Anurādhapura (PvsP[SL]), are also associated with this recension.
* The earliest evidence for this text comes from ĀryaVimuktisena's *Abhisamayālaṃkāravr̥tti*, dating to the sixth century.

* This recension may represent a parallel development of the LP text, possibly reflecting a specific local tradition.

##  Textual History of the Larger Prajñāpāramitā

* The text discusses the textual history of the Larger Prajñāpāramitā (LP) using various sources like early Chinese translations, Sanskrit texts, Tibetan and Chinese translations, and a detailed Indian commentary called DZDL.
* The author highlights the importance of the DZDL's temporal position as it reflects an earlier stage of the LP's development compared to later commentaries.

## Exegesis And Textual Variation In The Larger Prajñāpāramitā

* This section focuses on analyzing textual variations in the LP using a comparative approach between different sources.
* The author identifies instances where later LP witnesses (especially Sanskrit versions) show expanded readings compared to earlier ones (Dhr, Mo, and Kj).
*  The DZDL often prefigures these expansions in its glosses on the earlier, unexpanded readings, allowing for tracing the process of textual development.

## Challenges And Limitations

* The analysis is limited to a small portion of the vast LP corpus due to its size and complexity.
* The reliance on a single Chinese translation of the DZDL poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the original Sanskrit wording.
* The abridged nature of the second part of the DZDL might have obscured some instances of textual variation at the word level.
* The possibility that the DZDL's commentary might be based on a text different from the quoted one needs to be considered, potentially altering our understanding of the relationship between base text and glosses.




## 3.2 The Influence Of Early Exegesis On Larger Prajñāpāramitā Texts


* This section presents five passages exemplifying textual development in the LP anticipated by DZDL glosses.

* All other occurrences are listed in Appendix 1.1.

* Two caveats:
    * Classification is based on expansion under discussion, not absolute categories.
    * Translation policy treats Chinese sources as *Chinese* texts, mirroring their interpretation of vocabulary and syntax.

## Examples of Textual Development

* **Simple Expansion:** Addition of a common term to express the cause of an event.

    * Example: Transformation of flowers offered to Buddha into a tower.

        * Dhr, Mo, Kj differ in details but agree on spontaneous transformation.
        * DZDL gloss introduces Buddha's supernatural power as the cause.
        * Later LP texts (PvsP(K), LPG84) incorporate this idea and term (*bhagavato 'dhiṣṭhānena*).

* **Specificity:** Additions reflect a particular interpretation, even if simple.

    * Example: Samantaraśmi's journey to visit Buddha Śākyamuni.
        * Dhr and Mo have short accounts.
        * Kr is closer to PvsP(K), with added details.

* **Key Point:** These expansions presuppose a specific interpretation found in the DZDL gloss, suggesting a connection between the two texts.

## Summary

### # Bodhisattva Universal Radiance's Journey

* The Bodhisattva Universal Radiance receives golden lotuses from Buddha Heap of Jewels.
* He travels with many Bodhisattvas, both home-leaving and home-dwelling, as well as young men and women.
* They offer respect and praise to Buddhas in the East.
* They arrive at the place where Buddha Śākyamuni is located.
* The Bodhisattva Universal Radiance bows before Buddha Śākyamuni's feet and stands aside.

### # Commentary on the Retinue

* The DZDL commentary discusses how the Bodhisattva Universal Radiance's retinue reaches him.
* It suggests that those with weaker strength rely on the Bodhisattva's power, similar to a Wheel-turning king's retinue flying with him due to his merit.
* LPG adds an explanation about the Bodhisattva's supernatural power and empowering force enabling the retinue's journey.

### # Expansion in LPG

* The LPG recension includes an expansion not found in other LP scriptures or early Chinese translations.
* This expansion addresses a specific question raised by the DZDL gloss regarding the Bodhisattva's retinue reaching him.
* The expansion suggests a historical relationship between this particular exegetical tradition and the LPG text.

### # Bodhisattvas Avoiding Poverty

* The DZDL commentary questions why the LP mentions both giving and discipline as virtuous practices leading to avoiding evil destinies, but only focuses on avoiding evil destinies as the result.
* It suggests that giving also prevents poverty in future lives.
* LPG expands the passage by adding "they never become poor," addressing the DZDL's concern about the omission of poverty avoidance.




# There are, Śāradvatīputra, Bodhisattvas, great beings who...

* Bodhisattvas who practice giving and discipline never become poor.
* They also never fall into unfavorable rebirths until they reach the stage of non-retrogression.
* This addition emphasizes the specific outcome of practicing the perfection of giving.

# While my next example only involves the insertion of one single term...

* The passage describes the "pure Buddha eye" of a Bodhisattva and the attributes they attain.
* Different witnesses present variations and expansions of this list of attributes. 
* One group of witnesses (Mo, Dhr, Kj, PvsP(K)) presents a similar list including vajrasamādhi, sarvajñatā, Buddha's ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four equanimities, eighteen unshared buddhadharma, great loving-kindness, and great compassion. 




## (4.A.2) Dhr: 舍利弗白佛言:「云何開士大士佛眼淨?」

* **Buddha's response:** The Awakener, the Great Being, attains the Buddha eye purity by attaining Vajropamasamādhi, achieving all-penetrating insight, ten powers of the Thus-come One, four forms of fearlessness, four discriminative knowledges, eighteen unshared dharmas of Buddhas, great loving-kindness and compassion.
* **Result:** This allows them to comprehend all *buddhadharma*s without exception: seeing, hearing, understanding, and knowing everything.

## (4.a.3) Kj: 舍利弗白佛言:「世尊,云何菩薩摩訶薩佛眼淨?」

* **Buddha's response:** Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas attain Buddha eye purity by entering Vajropamasamādhi and attaining knowledge of all aspects. This leads to ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four unobstructed insights, eighteen unshared dharmas, great loving-kindness, and compassion.
* **Result:** They know everything about all *dharma*s without exception.

## (4.a.4) Xz(Ad): 時,舍利子復白佛言:「世尊,云何菩薩摩訶薩得 淨佛眼?」

* **Buddha's response:** Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas obtain the pure Buddha eye by entering Vajra-like concentration with an unbroken bodhicitta. This leads to knowledge of all aspects, ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four unobstructed understandings, eighteen unshared dharmas of Buddhas, great loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity.
* **Result:** They see, hear, realize, and remember everything without exception.

## (4.a.5) PvsP(K): Śāriputra āha: katamad Bhagavan bodhisattvasya mahāsattvasya pariśuddhaṃ buddhacakṣuḥ?

* **Buddha's response:** A Bodhisattva Mahāsattva, immediately after the thought of awakening, enters Vajropama-samādhi and attains knowledge of all aspects through insight associated with one single moment of thought. This leads to ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four special knowledges, eighteen special qualities of Buddhas, great loving-kindness, and compassion.
* **Result:** They see, hear, understand, and know everything in all aspects.

## DZDL Commentary:

* The commentary explains that a Bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi perfects six pāramitās until they attain knowledge of all aspects. 
* Entering Vajropamasamādhi breaks defilement impressions, leading to unhindered Buddha liberation (anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa) and the Buddha eye.

## (4.c.1) LPG: āha  katamat punar bhagavan bodhisattvasya mahāsatvasya pariśuddhaṃ buddhacakṣuḥ

* **Buddha's response:** The Bodhisattva Mahāsattva attains the pure Buddha eye by entering Vajropama-samādhi and attaining knowledge of all aspects. This leads to ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four special knowledges, eighteen special qualities, great loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and unhindered Buddha liberation (anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa).
* **Result:** They see, hear, remember, and know everything in all aspects.

## (4.c.2) Xz(Ś): 爾時,舍利子復白佛言:「世尊,云何菩薩摩訶薩得 淨佛眼?」

* **Buddha's response:** Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas attain the pure Buddha eye by entering Vajra-like concentration with an unbroken bodhicitta. This leads to knowledge of all aspects, ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four unobstructed understandings, eighteen unshared dharmas of Buddhas, great loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and unhindered, unobstructed liberation (anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa).
* **Result:** They surpass the insight of all Disciples and Solitary Awakened Ones, seeing, hearing, realizing, and remembering everything about all *dharma*s.

## (4.c.3) Xz(PvsP): 時,舍利子復白佛言:「世尊,云何菩薩摩訶薩 清淨佛眼?」


* **Buddha's response:** Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas attain the pure Buddha eye by entering Vajra-like concentration with an unbroken bodhicitta. This leads to knowledge of all aspects, ten powers, four forms of fearlessness, four unobstructed understandings, eighteen unshared dharmas of Buddhas, unhindered, unobstructed liberation (anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa), and the Buddha eye.
* **Result:** They surpass the insight of all Disciples and Solitary Awakened Ones, seeing, hearing, realizing, and remembering everything about all *dharma*s.



# anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa/*anāvaraṇavimokṣa

* This term is not common in *Prajñāpāramitā* literature.
* It does not appear in the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā*.
* It appears only once more in the Da banreboluomiduo jing 大般若波羅蜜多經 T 220, besides the passage discussed here.

# The Role of anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa in DZDL

* In contrast to its rarity elsewhere, *anāvaraṇavimokṣa* plays a significant role in the DZDL.
* Some passages attribute important functions to this faculty.
* For example, it is described as the form of *jñāna* that enables one to know the *citta* and caitasika of all beings.

# Textual Development: Addition of Terms

* Several examples show a linear pattern of textual development consisting in the addition of one word or a short passage traceable to DZDL glosses.
* This suggests a specific doctrinal interpretation, possibly reflected in the DZDL passage.

# A More Radical Form of Editing

* The first chapter of the three earliest Chinese translations shows a more radical form of editing.
* A passage about protecting Buddha-lands from interruption appears in these translations.

# LPG and Related Texts

* LPG and related texts present an expanded version of the passage found in the early translations.
* This expanded reading mentions the non-interruption not of Buddha fields, but of the Buddhas' arising and lineage.

# Connection to DZDL

* The DZDL gloss explains the "non-interruption of the *buddhakṣetra*s" as continuity in the arising of Buddhas.
* This foreshadows the wording of the later expanded reading found in LPG, etc.




## # The Textual History Of The Larger Prajñāpāramitā Revisited

* This section argues that studying early commentaries can provide valuable insights into the textual history of scriptures.
* It uses the DZDL commentary as a prime example, highlighting its significance in understanding the development of the LP literature.

## # 4.1 "Revised" and "Unrevised" Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā*: A Misleading Dichotomy in the History of the *Larger* Prajñāpāramitā
* This section challenges the traditional dichotomy between a supposedly "unrevised" and a "revised" version of the PvsP.
* It argues that this distinction is misleading and oversimplifies the complex dynamics of textual transmission within LP literature.
* The author presents evidence from various LP texts, including Kj, to demonstrate that even early versions show signs of significant textual development and rearrangement influenced by exegetical interpretations.



# Thus, even in our earliest versions of texts in this family, we encounter passages showing signs of expansions against other versions. 
* No "unrevised" LP text actually exists.
* The notion of an "unrevised" text is conceptually inaccurate.
* Texts are transmitted in a fluid form open to exegetical influence and revisions.

# At any rate, it seems completely misleading to describe the process of the development of the LP as a movement from a "pure" or "original" unrevised text to a "revised" one influenced by exegesis.
* The history of this literature reflects a movement from fluidity to stability.
* Exegetical accretions are not later interpolations but essential features.

# 4.2 From Textual Fluidity To Relative Stabilisation
* Textual fluidity is strongest in the upper reaches of the LP family's history.
* LPG shows considerable changes compared to earlier texts like Dhr, Mo, and Kj.
* Even Dhr and Mo show differences despite their closeness in time and space.
* LPG recension displays remarkable stabilisation across space and time.
* PvsP(K) and PvsP(SL) also show convergence and stabilisation.

* The transition from fluidity to stability likely occurred between the fifth and seventh centuries.
* This shift may reflect broader historical transformations in Indian Buddhism.
* Epigraphical data suggests Mahāyāna's growing institutional presence after the fifth century.
* New notions of texts and firmer boundaries between base texts and commentaries may have contributed to textual stability.

* The systematic adoption of quantitative criteria for classifying Prajñāpāramitā scriptures suggests systematisation of this literature.
* This trend is likely related to textual stabilisation and reflects structured monastic communities with high-profile patronage.

## 4.3 Traces Of A Northwestern Connection: The Da Zhidu Lun And The Larger Prajñāpāramitā From Gilgit

* There is a clear pattern where DZDL glosses influence later expanded readings in the LP, particularly in LPG and related texts (Ś and PvsP[TibPk]).
* This pattern suggests a close relationship between the DZDL and the LPG recension.
* The geographical proximity of Gilgit (where LPG was found) and the hypothesized Northwestern origin of the DZDL supports this connection.
* Both the DZDL's referenced library and the Gilgit corpus show similarities in their coexistence of Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna scriptures.

* This suggests a possible "Northwestern recension" of the LP, with distinctive readings reflecting a local exegetical tradition preserved in the DZDL.
* The evidence points to a Northwestern origin for this recension, which spread eastward as seen in Ś and PvsP[TibPk].

## 5 A Complex Commentary: The Nature And Historical Background Of The Da Zhidu Lun

* The DZDL's connection with expanded LP passages places it within a specific historical context (Gilgit valley in the early seventh century).
* This supports Lamotte's hypothesis about the commentary's Northwestern origin.
* The relationship between the DZDL and expanded LP passages needs further exploration to understand its nature.

*  The DZDL can be reconsidered as more than just a commentary due to its connection with specific textual innovations in the LP.

## 5.1 How Was The Da Zhidu Lun'S Exegesis Incorporated Into Larger Prajñāpāramitā Texts?

* The Da Zhidu Lun (DZDL) is unknown to Indian and Tibetan sources, with the evidence presented in this monograph potentially being the only documented trace of its influence on any Indian source.
* Instances of interaction between DZDL's exegesis and later Prajñāpāramitā (LP) texts are few and isolated, often concerning details in wording or general sense rather than philosophically significant ideas.

* Direct influence of DZDL might not be the only scenario, as its distinctive hermeneutical approach is not reflected extensively in LP expansions.
* The DZDL performs various functions, including providing detailed expositions of Buddhist thought, analyzing philosophical implications, and accounting for the literal meaning of the base text.

* A common lore of glosses, reflecting local exegetical traditions and originating as uncodified oral explanations on the LP, might explain the shared elements between DZDL and LP expansions.
* Marginal commentarial glosses do not seem to be a common feature of early Indian Buddhist *sūtra* manuscripts, making interpolation an unlikely explanation for textual developments.

* Oral textual practices played a significant role in Mahāyāna literature, with preaching and oral explanations accompanying scripture recitation.
* It is possible that the osmosis between commentary and expanded LP texts occurred at the level of humbler, orally transmitted exegesis focused on literal meaning.

* The DZDL may reflect this anonymous exegetical tradition, suggesting a "fluid" form of exegesis produced in the context of textual uses described by Mahāyāna *sūtra*s.
* This scenario implies that the DZDL is not only a philosophically sophisticated commentary but also a repository of fragments from an earlier, multi-authored, and possibly uncodified exegetical tradition.



## 5.2 A Polyphonic Commentary: The Nature Of The Da Zhidu Lun Reconsidered

* The authorship of the DZDL is often debated, with scholars focusing on whether Nāgārjuna wrote it.
* This emphasis overshadows other important issues, such as the nature of the commentary itself.
* Chou Po-kan's work highlights the significance of the translation process in shaping the DZDL.
* The present study focuses on the nature of the Indic *original* of the DZDL.

## A Polyphonic Text: Multiple Interpretations and Anonymous Voices

* The DZDL often provides multiple interpretations of specific questions, terms, and passages in the base text.
* Expressions like "furthermore" or "again" are used frequently to present different angles on a topic.
* Some interpretations appear complementary, while others seem mutually exclusive.
* The commentary explicitly mentions the views of other unnamed individuals using phrases like "some say."

## Anonymous Quotation Glosses: A Window into Early Prajñāpāramitā Exegesis

* These anonymous glosses are not unique to the DZDL but are a feature of Indian Buddhist exegetical literature.
* They can provide valuable information about the commentary and early developments in *Prajñāpāramitā* exegesis.
* These glosses likely originated in the original Indic text, not during the translation process.

* They are numerous in the DZDL and often occur in response to questions.
* In some cases, a quotation gloss is presented as the primary or sole answer to a question, suggesting its authority. 




## 5.3 Fragments Of A Lost World: Early Prajñāpāramitā Exegesis Quoted In The Da Zhidu Lun

* This section analyzes anonymous alternative opinions quoted in the Da Zhidu Lun (DZDL) commentary on the *Prajñāpāramitā*.
* These opinions are often related to specific passages of the *Prajñāpāramitā*, suggesting that the DZDL is referring to views of other commentators.

* Some of these quotations may reflect exegesis originally devoted to earlier versions of the *Prajñāpāramitā*.
* The DZDL's quotation glosses provide valuable insights into early *Prajñāpāramitā* exegesis, reminiscent of Abhidharmic debates.

* These fragments are likely the earliest surviving testimonies of *Prajñāpāramitā* exegesis produced outside China.
* An example is a passage where the DZDL quotes four different interpretations of why Samantaraśmi asks Ratnākara about Śākyamuni's miraculous powers, despite being the most eminent Bodhisattva in his world.

* Another example involves multiple quotation glosses on a single passage from the *Prajñāpāramitā*, where three hundred bhiksus offer their robes to the Buddha.
* The DZDL presents various anonymous interpretations of why these bhiksus might have broken monastic rules by doing so.

* These examples demonstrate the polyphonic commentarial style typical of the DZDL, which often cites multiple anonymous commentators.
* Several other instances of quotation glosses introduced by the formula *you ren yan* are mentioned throughout the text.




##  Quotation Glosses in the Dazhidu Lun

* Four quotation glosses provide explanations for an expression found in a Lotus Sutra passage (餘心、心數 法雜).

## Quotation Gloss Interpreting Questions by Subhūti

* A single quotation gloss interprets three questions asked by Subhūti about practicing prajñāpāramitā as referring to different stages of the Bodhisattva's career.

## Quotation Gloss on *Śūnyatā*

* In response to a question about why a passage only mentions two forms of *śūnyatā*, the commentary quotes an anonymous gloss in addition to its own explanations.

## Quotation Glosses on the Story of Sadāprarudita

* This section of the Dazhidu Lun contains a particularly high number of quotation glosses, possibly due to reliance on pre-existing Aṣṭasāhasrikā exegesis.
    * Three glosses address the origins of Sadāprarudita's name and character.
    * A fourth gloss explains the nature of the voice inviting Sadāprarudita on his quest.

## Quotation Gloss on the Buddha Appearing to Sadāprarudita

* A gloss states that the Buddha appearing in the sky is not a real Buddha, but an image. This interpretation may be reflected in the corresponding passage of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā.

## Quotation Glosses on the Nature of Dharmodgata

* Two anonymous interpretations are quoted regarding Dharmodgata's nature:
    * One gloss describes him as a Bodhisattva with a "body of birth," capable of antinomian behaviors to save beings.
    * The second gloss states that Dharmodgata has a body produced from *dharma* nature and was created to save the people of Gandhavatī, indicating he is a transformation body of a great Bodhisattva.

## Quotation Gloss on Sadāprarudita's Poverty

* Three glosses explain the causes of Sadāprarudita's poverty.

## Quotation Glosses on Another Point in the Sadāprarudita Narrative

* Two glosses answer a question about another point in the story.

## Identifying Commentarial Styles

* The high number of quotation glosses suggests the possibility of identifying distinctive commentarial styles and traces of lost works by individual commentators.
* One example shows the same anonymous commentator offering opinions on both Dharmodgata's nature and the transformation of objects into a flower tower, hinting at a specific early Prajñāpāramitā commentator with unique ideas.

## 5.4 The Da Zhidu Lun And The Vibhāṣā Compendia

* The DZDL is likely a compilation of various exegetical materials, making it a complex and heterogeneous work.
* Kumārajīva may have compiled the DZDL, but even if he did, it doesn't negate the influence of Sanskrit LP texts on the commentary.
* The DZDL's extensive use of quotation glosses is not unique, but its systematic presentation of various viewpoints using "*fuci* 復次 passages" sets it apart from other *Prajñāpāramitā* commentaries.

* Lamotte suggested that the DZDL might be a collective work, and this hypothesis is supported by new evidence.
* The DZDL likely originated in a Northwestern milieu around the time when there wasn't an established tradition of commentaries specifically devoted to *Prajñāpāramitā* scriptures.
* This suggests that the compiler(s) may have looked for established models elsewhere, potentially finding inspiration in the "*vibhāṣā* compendia" of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma.

* The "*vibhāṣā* compendia" are characterized by a distinctive "style and method of exegesis" that involves citing different positions on a topic and sometimes selecting one interpretation as preferred.
* This approach shares similarities with the DZDL's tendency to record multiple interpretations and quote other commentators.

* The DZDL's likely historical background and its pervasive use of techniques found in "*vibhāṣā* compendia" suggest a significant connection between these two types of commentaries.
* While the DZDL has its own coherent method and ideology, it also incorporates inherited exegesis, making it both an individual and collective work.

* The DZDL likely started as an experimental work, adapting existing exegetical genres to the specific needs of interpreting the LP text.

## 6 Conclusions

* This chapter discusses instances where the exegesis preserved by the DZDL influenced the development of LP scriptures and the implications for all sources involved.
* The study shows a transition from textual fluidity to relative textual stabilization between the fifth and seventh centuries.
* There is a clear relationship between the exegetical tradition represented by the DZDL and later LP recensions, particularly LPG.

## 5 The DZDL: Implications for its Understanding

* This chapter explores the implications of the findings for our understanding of the DZDL.
* It argues that the DZDL should be seen as an inclusive, polyphonic commentary rather than focusing solely on authorship.
* The numerous quotations of anonymous glosses in the DZDL highlight a rich repository of early Prajñāpāramitā exegesis.

## 4 Textual Fluidity and Exegetical Influence: A Broader Perspective

* This chapter examines the porosity between base texts and exegesis, noting that this phenomenon is not exclusive to the LP family.
* It cites examples from various scriptures and traditions demonstrating the interaction between textual formation and exegesis.
* The study suggests that early Mahāyāna did not have a separate institutional identity, leading to fluidity at a textual level.

## 3 Textual History of the LP: A Case Study

* This chapter analyzes specific instances where the DZDL's exegesis influenced the development of LP scriptures.
* It focuses on passages in the PvsP and LPG that show clear signs of being shaped by the DZDL's interpretations.
* The study highlights the complex relationship between base texts and commentaries in the transmission of Buddhist literature.

## 2 Methodology: Identifying Exegetical Influence


* This chapter outlines the methodology used to identify instances of exegetical influence from the DZDL on LP scriptures.
* It explains the criteria used to distinguish between original text and later additions or modifications.
* The study emphasizes the importance of considering both textual and contextual evidence in analyzing these relationships.

# The Aṣṭasāhasrikā and its Transmission

* "Giving up oneself" means selling one's body, while "giving up one's life" refers to death. 
* Foolish people reject the Buddha's teaching that all things are empty.
* An irreversible Bodhisattva gives up his life so that he and others can obtain this teaching.

# Textual Transmission in Mahāyāna Buddhism

* The existence of multiple recensions of Mahāyāna scriptures suggests a dynamic approach to textual transmission.
* Alteration and expansion were essential components of how these texts were conceived and used, especially in their early history.
* This textual flexibility reflects deeply ingrained Buddhist notions of truth and language.

# The "Word of the Buddha"

* Buddhists are less concerned with the precise wording of the Buddha's teachings than with their general sense and spirit.
* There is an acceptance of an expanded conception of "word of the Buddha," which includes anything said by reliable disciples or interpreters.
* This allows for modification of texts downstream, leading to a model of "diffused authoriality."

# Contemporary Practices

* The restoration process of Aṣṭasāhasrikā manuscripts in Nepal involves significant interventions into the text, including integration of passages and corrections.
* While these practices may seem like a "philologist's nightmare," they reflect an old tradition of treating sacred texts as open to change.
* Both historical and contemporary practices suggest that a dynamic dimension of change and openness is an essential component of notions of sacred text in Buddhism. 




# Appendix 1 Other Instances Of Interaction Between Larger Prajñāpāramitā Texts And The Da Zhidu Lun

* This appendix lists and analyzes other passages where the *Da zhidu lun* (DZDL) can be used as an important source for reconstructing the history of the *Prajñāpāramitā* literature (*LP*).
* The first section (Appendix 1.1) includes instances where an earlier reading appears to have been expanded through the addition of words that are "anticipated" in the relevant DZDL glosses.

* The second section (Appendix 1.2) presents one passage where an expansion echoed by the DZDL is also shared by one of the *early* witnesses.
* Passages are listed according to their order of occurrence in the LP.


# 1.1 Instances of Chronologically Linear Textual Expansion

(Earlier Reading → *Da zhidu lun* Commentary → Later Expanded Reading)

* This section includes instances where an earlier reading appears to have been expanded through the addition of words that are "anticipated" in the relevant DZDL glosses.
* The passage occurs in the initial portion of the LP, containing a long list of often elaborated compounds describing qualities of the Bodhisattvas who have gathered to attend the Buddha's preaching.

* The earliest Chinese translations, but also PvsP(K) and PvsP(SL)—as is often the case in this portion of the LP—agree in a shorter reading:
    * Dhr: 意不懷害 (T 222 [VIII] p. 147a25; GZJ § 1.43, in Zacchetti 2005: 148 and 251).

[Their] minds did not harbour harmful [intentions].
    * Mo: 意無罣礙 (T 221 [VIII] p. 1a23).

[Their] minds did not have obstructions.

    * Kj: 意無罣[=絓【宋】【宮】]閡258 (T 223 [VIII] p. 217a24–25); same meaning as Mo.
* The DZDL's commentary makes clear that the compound can be interpreted in two ways, as referring to a mental attitude with respect to both living beings and *dharma*s:

* The initial part of the DZDL gloss is of interest to us, especially the phrase "the living beings of all worlds" (一切世界眾生中), as this explication is partly reflected by the expanded text found in the LPG recension and Xz(Ś):
    * LPG: sarvasatvā*pratihatacitta*ḥ (LPG f. 1v4; so also Ś p. 5,11 and PvsP[TibPk] nyi 2b5).

Their minds not hostile towards all beings.
    * Xz(Ś): 於諸有情,心無罣礙 (T 220 [V] p. 1c7–8).

* It is noteworthy that, at the end of the passage quoted above, the DZDL mentions an alternative interpretation of *apratihatacitta* ("Furthermore, [the Bodhisattvas'] mind is without obstructions with respect to *dharma*s"), as this implies that the expansion apratihatacitta → sarvasatvā*pratihatacitta* is by no means a predetermined textual development, but reflects a specific interpretation.

* A more interesting example, showing a partly similar pattern of textual development, is provided by another compound occurring in the initial portion of the LP. In this case, too, the three earliest witnesses reflect a shorter reading:
    * Dhr: 攝取佛土無限之願 (T 222 [VIII] p. 147a26; GZJ § 1.46, in Zacchetti 2005: 148 and 252).

They had taken on endless vows [concerning] the lands of the Buddhas.
    * Mo: 願攝無數無量佛國 (T 221 [VIII] p. 1a23–24).

[Their] vows embraced innumerable, immeasurable Buddha-lands.

    * Kj: 願受無量諸佛國土[=世界【宋】【元】【明】【宮】] (T 223 [VIII] p. 217a25–26).

[Their] vows encompassed immeasurable Buddha-lands.
* Lamotte (I p. 404; cf. also Vetter 1993: 57)—no doubt on the basis of the attested Sanskrit readings—reconstructed the original underlying Kj's translation as *apramāṇabuddhakṣetrapraṇidhānaparig*r̥hītaiḥ*. Even if perhaps it might be preferable to read the initial part of the compound as **anantabuddhakṣetra*-, as suggested by LPG (see below; cf. also Vetter 1993: 57), I think that all in all Lamotte's proposal represents an acceptable working hypothesis, which essentially can also be extended to Mo and Dhr, although Dhr reflects a different syntactical analysis of the compound.

* The DZDL comments extensively on this short passage (T 1509 [XXV] p. 108a28–c20; tr. Lamotte I pp. 404–408), but it is only the first part of the gloss, before the series of questions and answers, which is of interest to us.



#  Commentary on "願受無量諸佛世界"

* When Bodhisattvas see Buddha worlds' adornments and purities, they form various vows.
* Some vow to create worlds without suffering, even lacking the names of the three evil rebirths. 
* They vow to obtain all such adornments and purities of immeasurable Buddha worlds.
* Therefore, their vows encompass immeasurable Buddha-lands.

#  DZDL's Explanation and Related Texts

* DZDL explains the compound based on the notion of *vyūha*.
* Xuanzang's translations reflect a reading in line with earliest witnesses.
* LPG and PvsP have slightly different expanded readings mirroring DZDL's interpretation.

# Comparison of Passages

* The sentence concluding the DZDL passage prefigures LPG's text of this compound in word order. 
*  LPG and PvsP expansions may reflect awareness of a classification of *bodhicitta*.
* The Tibetan translation (PvsP[TibPk]) suggests an attempt to unpack the functional relationship between two categories: vow about Buddha-fields' adornments as a motivating force for embracing the Bodhisattva path.

#  Passage in Dhr and Mo

* At the end of the list of compounds describing Bodhisattvas, Dhr and Mo have a short formula stating that all Bodhisattvas possess these qualities.
* Kj and another LP scripture expand on this formula. 




## 8.B. (Partially Expanded Readings)

* The Bodhisattvas were dwelling with the Buddha and their meritorious virtues were immeasurable and could not be exhausted even in countless kalpas.
* This gloss is closely mirrored by readings found in later texts.

## 8.c. (Commentary)


* These Bodhisattvas were dwelling with the Buddha, and if one wanted to praise their meritorious virtues, not even in immeasurable *koṭis of *kalpa*s could [their praise] be exhausted. Therefore, the LP says: "immeasurable meritorious virtues had been attained".

## 8.d.1 (LPG)
* Accompanied by praise of [their] qualities not exhausted [even if continued] for unlimited *kalpa*s.

## 8.d.2 (Xz(Ś))
* These Bodhisattvas were endowed with an ocean of such wonderful meritorious virtues, [of which] one would not be able to be exhaustive in [one's] praise even through immeasurable koṭis of great *kalpa*s.

## 8.d.3 (Xz(Ad))
* The group of these Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas was endowed with such immeasurable meritorious virtues, [of which] one would not be able to be exhaustive in [one's] praise [even] through innumerable *kalpa*s.

## 9.a.1 (Dhr)

* At that moment all the gods [and those other beings], as soon as they were reborn in those [favourable conditions, namely] among human beings or as gods, remembered their previous lives, felt happy and blissful, and went towards the place where the Buddha was.

## 9.a.2 (Mo)
* As soon as [those beings] had been reborn [as gods and humans], they rejoiced and remembered their previous lives; [then] each went to the place where the Buddha of their own world was ...

## 9.a.3 (Kj)
* All these gods and humans naturally remembered their previous lives and greatly rejoiced; [then] they came towards the place where the Buddha was ...

## 9.c.1 (PvsP(K))

* Then those humans and those gods, due to nothing other than the Lord's empowering force, remembered their previous lives, and having so done, [moved] by that very delight and joy, they went where the Lord was.


## 10.a.1 (Dhr)
* At that moment, in this world-system, all the gods of the ŚuddhāvāsaPure-Abode, the Brahma-gods, the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods, Nirmāṇarati gods, Tuṣita gods, Yāma gods, Trayastriṃśa gods, gods  of the four great kings and the people dwelling in the three thousand great thousand world systems naturally saw [the Buddha] with their own bodies, approached him, and all received naturally occurring heavenly flowers, heavenly fragrances, heavenly mixed fragrances, heavenly pounded fragrances, heavenly blue lotuses, hibiscus, Heng flowers and other wonderful heavenly flowers.

* Different versions offer varying interpretations of "durāsada" (difficult to approach).

* Some texts highlight the potential harm one might face when interacting with these Bodhisattvas with hostility.
* The DZDL gloss explains that the Bodhisattvas' great merit and wisdom make them hard to overcome, match, crush, or approach.

## 12.a (Reception and Retention of Teaching)

* This section focuses on the benefits of training in the Perfection of Insight for a Bodhisattva seeking to hear and retain the teachings of Buddhas across the ten directions.
* The text emphasizes uninterrupted listening until attaining *anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi*.
* Different versions expand upon this idea, with some mentioning the importance of not forgetting the teachings received.

## 12.B. (Partially Expanded Readings)

* **(12.b.1) Kj:** If a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to hear the Dharma expounded by all the Buddhas of the ten directions, and, having heard, not to forget it until attaining *anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi*, he should train in the *prajñāpāramitā*.
* **(12.b.2) Xz(Ś):** If a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to hear the correct Dharma in the presence of each of the Buddhas from Buddha-worlds equal [in number] to the sands of the River Ganges in the ten directions, constantly, without weariness, and, in conformity to what he has heard, never to forget it until attaining the supreme perfect *bodhi*, he should train in the *prajñāpāramitā*.

* **(12.c.1) PvsP(K):**  Furthermore, Śāriputra, a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva who, having heard the teachings expounded by those Buddhas, [those] Lords everywhere in the ten directions, wishes to retain them all by means of the uninterrupted possession of the power of memory until he is fully awakened in the Supreme Perfect Awakening, should train in the Perfection of Insight.
* **(12.c.2) LPG:** Furthermore, Śāradvatīputra, a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva who, having heard the teaching expounded by those Buddhas, [those] Lords in worlds equal [in number] to the sands of the River Ganges everywhere in the ten directions, wishes to retain it all by means of the uninterrupted possession of the power of memory until he is fully awakened in the Supreme Perfect Awakening, and in the meantime not to allow it to be lost, should train in the Perfection of Insight.

* **(12.d) DZDL:** Question: If even what one single Buddha preaches is hard to retain, how much less should one wish to remember and not to forget what innumerable Buddhas preach? Answer: The Bodhisattva is able to receive [the Buddhas' teaching] due to the power of the *dhāraṇī* retaining [what has been] heard, [and is able] not to forget [it] due to the power of the *dhāraṇī* which makes memory firm.

## 13.A. (Seeing Buddha-Fields)

* **(13.a.1) Dhr:** Furthermore, Śāriputra, if a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to see the Tathāgatas, the Arhats, the Samyaksaṃbuddhas of the past; if he wishes to see [their] various Buddha-lands, [and] the worlds in the ten directions of the future and of the present, [as well as] the Buddhas of the present; if he wishes to observe everything found in those lands, he should train in the *prajñāpāramitā*.
* **(13.a.2) Mo:** Furthermore, Śāriputra, if a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to see the kṣetra-lands of the World-Honoured Ones, the Buddhas of the past and the Buddhas of the present, he should train in the *prajñāpāramitā*.
* **(13.a.3) Kj:** Furthermore, Śāriputra, if a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to see the lands of the Buddhas of the past and the future, and to see the lands of the Buddhas [who exist] at present in the ten directions, he should train in the *prajñāpāramitā*.

## Text Summary

### # Commentary on the Expanded Reading of LPG

* The expanded reading in LPG is likely due to the context of the LP, which deals with Bodhisattvas acquiring supernatural powers through *prajñāpāramitā*.
* Seeing seems naturally required by the text at this point.
* The compound *buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi*- echoes DZDL's explanation of the unexpanded reading.

### # DZDL Commentary on the Three Gateways to Liberation

* The DZDL addresses the apparent contradiction between the presence of the three gateways to liberation and the rejection of *nirvāṇ*a in this passage.
* It explains that without expedient means, entering the three gateways leads directly to *nirvāṇ*a.
* With expedient means, one can see *nirvāṇ*a but avoid dwelling there due to compassion.

### # PvsP(TibPk) Commentary on the Three Gateways to Liberation

* The Tibetan translation of the PvsP adds a phrase that presupposes the same interpretation as the DZDL.
* It states that the Bodhisattva, through skilfulness in means, surpasses the stages of Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas and obtains the stage of the irreversible Bodhisattva.




# 15.a Examples of Textual Expansion in the LP

* The passage discusses examples of textual expansion within the *Lotus Sutra* (LP).
* It highlights variations between different versions of the text, including Mo, Kj, Xz(Ś), Xz(PvsP), PvsP(K) and Dhr.
* These variations involve additions to the original text, particularly regarding the concept of *dharma*s combining with each other.

# 15.b A Unique Expansion in Dhr

* This section focuses on a unique expansion found in the Dhr version of the LP.
* It involves an additional phrase about non-coexistence with forces leading to birth and death.
* While this expansion seems to align with a similar concept in the LPG recension, its position within the text differs.

# 1.2 An Example Of Chronologically Non-Linear Textual Expansion

* This section presents a case where textual expansions mirrored by the DZDL commentary are also found in one of the earliest LP texts (Mo).
* It discusses a passage listing synonyms for *ātman*, with Mo presenting a longer version compared to PvsP(K).
* The expanded readings emphasize the linguistic nature of these categories of selfhood.

## 16.B. (Partially Expanded Readings)

* **(16.b.1)** Categories like "Buddha", "bodhisattva" and *skandha*s are all like the self: non-existent, with nothing to cling to; they are provisional designations with empty words.

* **(16.b.2)** Just as "self" is a nominal entity, so are living beings (眾生) etc.: all these categories cannot be apprehended due to emptiness and are merely spoken of by names.

* **(16.b.2)**  The self is merely a nominal entity; while one calls it "self", it cannot be apprehended. The same applies to sentient beings, seer etc., which are also merely nominal entities. They cannot be apprehended due to emptiness and are provisionally established as accidental designations. This holds true for all *dharma*s, which should not be clung to.

## Appendix 2 A Note On The Term Anāvaraṇa- (Buddha)- Vimokṣa-

* The term *wu'ai jietuo* 無礙解脫 (*anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa*), "unhindered liberation", is central in the DZDL and occurs frequently, with doctrinal consistency. It is important for understanding Buddha qualities and advanced Bodhisattva stages.
* This term is notably absent from Xuanzang's *Mahāvibhāṣā* and *Yogācārabhūmi*, despite their discussions on Buddha qualities.

* The term appears rarely in other Buddhist literature, making its prominence in the DZDL remarkable. 
* Lamotte did not offer a detailed analysis of this term, likely due to its rarity in other scholastic sources.

## 2.1 The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa In The Da Zhidu Lun

* **Definition:**  The *anāvaraṇavimokṣa*, or "unhindered liberation," is a technical term in the DZDL, signifying a specific type of attainment or quality. It is not merely an occasional qualification of jietuo 解脫/**vimokṣa*.

* **Function:** The DZDL systematically presents *anāvaraṇavimokṣa* as important for acquiring specific states and powers. This reflects a tendency in Buddhist literature to view *vimokṣa* as referring to the powers resulting from mental detachment practices, rather than the practices themselves. 
* **Cognitive Enhancement:**

    *  *Anāvaraṇavimokṣa* enhances cognitive powers by enabling one to know the inclinations of all beings' minds.
    * It is presented as a fundamental constituent of awakening and empowers other faculties like *prajñāpāramitā*.
    * It acts synergistically with other faculties, such as *samādhi*, allowing for unhindered knowledge of all dharmas.

## 2.1.1 The Cognitive Functions Of The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa

* **Types:** Different varieties (or degrees) of *anāvaraṇavimokṣa* exist, including one characteristic of Buddhas (*anāvaraṇa-buddhavimokṣa*).
* **Quotation Glosses:** Some passages present the notion of *anāvaraṇavimokṣa* as "quotation glosses," suggesting a specific exegetical tradition.




## # The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa As A Quality Of Buddhas

*  The cognitive function of the anāvaraṇavimokṣa applies only to Buddhas and advanced Bodhisattvas.
* The DZDL presents this form of liberation as both an essential characteristic of Buddhas and a key constituent of the advanced Bodhisattva path.
* The anāvaraṇavimokṣa is introduced as a key facet of the Buddhas' liberation, which is indestructible because it involves the complete eradication of defilements and related residual impressions.

## # 2.1.3 The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa As Part Of The Advanced Bodhisattva Path
* The DZDL describes the final stages of the Bodhisattvas' path to awakening, in which the anāvaraṇavimokṣa is mentioned as a crucial factor.
* A passage contrasts different opinions about the destruction of the *kleśa*s and the vāsanās, representing the "correct theory" from the viewpoint of the DZDL.

* According to this theory, Bodhisattvas obtain the anāvaraṇavimokṣa through their practice, which allows them to attain omniscience and eradicate all defilements and residual impressions.

## [A]法忍=忍法【宋】【元】【明】【宮】

* Bodhisattvas obtain *anutpattikadharmakṣānti*, defilements are exhausted.
* Residual impressions (*vāsanā*) remain, causing rebirth through transformation (化生) at will.
* Driven by great loving-kindness and compassion, they return to the world to achieve remaining *buddhadharma*s.

## 2.1.4 The Status Of The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa

* DZDL recognizes different types of anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa for Buddhas and advanced Bodhisattvas.
* Another passage distinguishes Buddhas' anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa from Bodhisattvas' inconceivable *samādhi*.
* This suggests "the unhindered liberation of the Buddhas" might have a specific technical meaning.
* Inconsistencies in DZDL's treatment highlight different interpretations of anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa within its doctrinal milieu.

## 2.2 The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa In Other Mahāyāna Sources

* The term appears in texts like the *Lalitavistara*, Rāṣṭra-pālaparip*r̥cchā*, and other important Mahāyāna *sūtra*s.
* This section will analyze a few key occurrences without aiming for exhaustiveness or conceptual systematization.
* The goal is to provide an approximate understanding of the term's usage outside the DZDL. 




## 2.2.1 The Bajaur Mahāyāna Sūtra

* The term "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" is found in the *Bajaur Mahāyāna Sūtra*, a birch-bark fragment from the first–second centuries CE.
* This text mentions a series of features of the Buddha that are not perceived, leading to correct understanding and confidence in the Buddha.
* The *Bajaur Mahāyāna Sūtra* suggests that "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" was already considered a typical feature of Buddhas at this early stage of Mahāyāna literature.

## 2.2.2 The Samādhirāja-Sūtra

* The *Samādhirāja-sūtra* describes the Buddha as possessing "anāvaraṇavimokṣajñānasamanvāgataḥ," meaning endowed with knowledge of unhindered liberation.
* This passage connects "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" to the Buddha's omniscience, similar to the DZDL conception.
* The context of this passage is close to that of the LP passage (Passage 4) analyzed in Chapter 3.2.

## 2.2.3 The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa In The Daśabhūmika-Sūtra And Related Sources

* **Passage Analysis:**

    * This section focuses on passages from the *Daśabhūmika-sūtra* that use the term "anāvaraṇavimokṣa".
    * One passage describes a Bodhisattva reflecting on how to help living beings achieve liberation and certainty in all dharmas. 
    * The Bodhisattva concludes that this is achieved through unhindered liberation and knowledge, which is attained through right understanding of all dharmas.

* **Terminology:**

    * The compound "anāvaraṇavimokṣajñānasthāna" (abiding in unhindered liberation and knowledge) is presented as a culminating cognitive and spiritual status.
    * This term appears consistently in other Mahāyāna sources, suggesting its importance.

* **Further References:**

    * The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra* also mentions "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" in the context of liberations obtained by a Bodhisattva who has reached the fifth and tenth bhūmis.
    * The commentary on the *Daśabhūmika-sūtra*, attributed to Vasubandhu, defines "unhindered liberation" as the ability to reach worlds beyond measure and possess knowledge resulting from resolve that is unhindered.

* **Kumārajīva's Translation:**

    * Kumārajīva's translation of a stanza in the *Daśabhūmika-sūtra* replaces "vimokṣasthāna" with "wu'ai jietuo" (unhindered liberation).
    * This suggests Kumārajīva's tendency to make doctrinal contents explicit in his translations.

* **Daśabhūmikavibhāṣā:**

    * The commentary *Daśabhūmikavibhāṣā*, also translated by Kumārajīva, defines "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" as liberation from three types of hindrances: defilements, absorptions, and all dharmas.
    * This definition highlights the comprehensive nature of unhindered liberation.

## 2.2.4 The Anāvaraṇavimokṣa In Other Buddhāvataṃsaka Scriptures

* The term "anāvaraṇavimokṣa" appears in other Buddhāvataṃsaka scriptures, such as the Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra.
* The Buddhabhadra translation of the Buddhāvataṃsaka lists ten forms of unhindered liberation, essentially displays of supernatural powers.

## 2.2.5 The Vimalakīrtinirdeśa And The Zhu Weimojie Jing


* The *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* refers to "inconceivable liberation" (*acintyavimokṣa*) which is closely related to the concept of unhindered liberation.
* Kumārajīva's commentary, the *Zhu Weimojie jing*, discusses the nature of inconceivable liberation and its connection to supernatural powers and freedom from hindrances.
* The *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* mentions Bodhisattvas abiding in unhindered liberation.
* Both Kumārajīva and Sengzhao provide glosses on this passage, explaining the meaning of unhindered liberation and its relationship to other Buddhist concepts.

## 2.3 Conclusions

* The term anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa* appears occasionally in some Mahāyāna *sūtra*s but rarely in treatises and exegetical texts.
* Daśabhūmika commentaries discuss the anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa*, but its significance differs from that in the DZDL.

    * In the DZDL, the term has a much higher frequency and doctrinal importance.
    * In Daśabhūmika commentaries, it is mentioned because it already occurs in the base text.

* The DZDL's emphasis on anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa* was not influenced by its specific base text or Prajñāpāramitā literature in general. This suggests that the concept reflects a distinctive exegetical tradition within which the commentary was produced.
* This finding has implications for understanding the textual expansion discussed in Chapter 3.2. The addition of anāvaraṇ*avimokṣa* in LPG and other sources was influenced by this distinctive exegetical tradition, also reflected in the DZDL.

## # The Da zhidu lun and the History of the Larger Prajñāpāramitā

* **The DZDL as a reflection of textual fluidity:**

    * The DZDL exemplifies the "fluid" exegesis prevalent in Chinese translation practice prior to the Sui and Tang periods.
    * This fluidity is characterized by gradual textual stabilization of LP texts, intentional diachronic variation, porosity between root texts and exegesis, and the relationship of *vibhāṣā* compendia to their root-texts.

* **The DZDL's sources and structure:**

    * The DZDL draws upon a variety of sources, including the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra (Lamotte I–V), the Ga*ṇḍavyūha-sūtra*, and possibly other lost texts.
    * Its structure reflects a process of textual expansion and elaboration, with later additions often building upon earlier interpretations.

* **The DZDL's influence on later developments in the LP:**

    * The DZDL's wording influenced later developments of the LP, particularly in its focus on the concept of anāvaraṇavimokṣa (unhindered liberation).
    * This influence can be seen in the way that later commentators and translators interpreted key passages in the LP.

## # Commentaries and Commentarial Style

* **The role of commentaries in shaping the understanding of the LP:**

    * Commentaries played a crucial role in shaping the understanding of the LP, providing explanations, interpretations, and glosses on difficult passages.
    * They also served to transmit and preserve the tradition of exegesis associated with the LP.

* **The fluidity of commentaries:**

    * Like the LP itself, commentaries were subject to a degree of fluidity, with different commentators offering varying interpretations and additions.
    * This fluidity reflects the dynamic nature of Buddhist thought and practice.

* **Examples of commentary styles:**

    * The DZDL's style is characterized by its detailed explanations, its use of Sanskrit terms, and its focus on doctrinal issues.
    * Other commentaries, such as Jizang's *Da pin jing yishu*, adopt a more concise and practical approach.

## # Glosses

* **The function of glosses in clarifying the meaning of the LP:**

    * Glosses are brief explanations or annotations added to the text of the LP to clarify its meaning.
    * They can be found both within the body of the text and in marginal notes.

* **Types of glosses:**

    * Marginal commentarial glosses, scholia in Greek and Latin manuscripts, and anonymous glosses are all examples of different types of glosses.

* **The influence of glosses on later developments in the LP:**

    * Glosses can have a significant impact on the way that the LP is understood and interpreted.
    * They can introduce new ideas, clarify ambiguities, and shape the trajectory of exegetical tradition.
