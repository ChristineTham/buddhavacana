# sphinx

* The 'sphinx' seal is interpreted as a symbol of divinity representing a star.
* It depicts a human head offered to a tree-goddess, raising questions about the nature of worship and potential connections to proto-Śiva figures.

# Woman and Tree

* Images depict a woman emerging from a tree, symbolizing her growth and independence while acknowledging the tree as her origin.
* The woman becomes the central focus, with the tree receding into the unconscious, representing a shift in consciousness.

# Saṅghamittā and the Bodhi Tree

* This image shows Saṅghamittā bringing a sapling of the Bodhi tree to Sri Lanka, highlighting the submission of worldly power to the sacred.
* The woman and tree are distinct but equal, with the tree as an archetype and the woman as a personified embodiment.

# Tissarakkhitā and the Bodhi Tree

* Tissarakkhitā, Aśoka's evil wife, represents a contrasting figure who attempts to destroy the Bodhi tree out of jealousy and ambition.
* This highlights the conflict between those who embrace and those who reject the sacred power of the tree.

# Kāliṅga Jātaka and the Bodhi Tree

* The story of the Kāliṅga Jātaka establishes the canonical authority for Bodhi tree worship, linking it to fertility motifs and royal lineage.
* It emphasizes the importance of humility before the power of the Bodhi tree, even for rulers.

# Saṅghamittā's Legacy

* Saṅghamittā established the Sri Lankan bhikkhuni lineage, completing the four-fold assembly of Buddhism.
* Despite its age and authenticity, the bhikkhuni Sangha faces rejection from some Theravāda and Tibetan Buddhists, raising questions about gender roles within Buddhism. 




# Chapter 2 A Myth Of Origins

* The story of Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, the Buddha's step-mother and supposed first bhikkhuni, is central to understanding the Buddhist community's response to nuns and women's spirituality.
* This myth portrays women as capable of attaining spiritual heights but simultaneously relegates them to a secondary position within Buddhism.

* Myths of origin aim to legitimize present customs by appealing to ancient authority, not necessarily reflecting historical accuracy.

* The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya version of the story is chosen for analysis due to its unique features and differences from other versions.
* This version includes Suddhodana, the Buddha's father, seeking ordination, which may be a later development imitating Mahāpajāpatī's story.

* The text highlights conflicting claims about women's ordination based on unverifiable legendary timeframes, demonstrating how mythology influences real-life practices.
* The story recounts Mahāpajāpatī's repeated requests for ordination and the Buddha's refusals, citing past Buddhas' prohibitions and suggesting alternative paths for women.

* Ānanda, a disciple of the Buddha, pleads with him on behalf of Mahāpajāpatī and the 500 Śākyan women who wish to become nuns.
* The Buddha eventually concedes, allowing them to follow eight *garudhammas*, which serve as their form of ordination.

# Chapter 2 A Myth Of Origins (Continued)

* These eight *garudhammas* establish a hierarchical relationship between bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, placing restrictions on the latter's actions and requiring dependence on the former for guidance and approval.
* The Buddha justifies these restrictions by emphasizing the need to maintain order and prevent potential conflicts within the monastic community.



# 40

* A bhikkhuni, even if ordained for 100 years, should bow in homage and rise to greet a newly ordained bhikkhu.

# 41-44

* Ānanda learned this teaching from the Buddha and relayed it to Gotamī.
* Gotamī accepted the teaching with joy and likened it to receiving a garland of flowers.
* She then requested an indulgence: that bhikkhunis bow to bhikkhus based on seniority, not ordination length.

# 45-48

* The Buddha refused Gotamī's request, explaining that women have five obstacles preventing them from reaching the highest spiritual attainment.
* He stated that allowing women to ordain would shorten the lifespan of his teachings by 500 years.
* Ānanda was deeply grieved by this news but the Buddha comforted him, saying that Māra had clouded his mind.

# 49-50

* Gotamī, pleased with the opportunity for ordination, asked Ānanda to request full ordination for 500 Śākyan women.
* The Buddha agreed, allowing Pajāpatī to ordain them with the assistance of ten bhikkhus.

# 51-52

* This story is significant for Buddhist nuns as it highlights the challenges they face due to their gender.
* The author finds no logical explanation within Buddhism for the restrictions placed on women and views the story as a myth.

# 53

* The Mahīśāsaka version of the story omits some details found in other versions, such as the comparison of bhikkhuni ordination to a disease or flood that weakens Buddhism.

# 54-56

* Other versions of the story use vivid imagery to describe the negative impact of women's ordination on Buddhism, comparing it to diseases that destroy crops and floods that overwhelm dykes.
* The Buddha established eight rules for bhikkhunis as a precaution to mitigate these supposed dangers.

# 57-58

* The Mahāpajāpatī myth establishes the requirement for monks to participate in nuns' ordinations, giving them control over the nuns' community and reproductive rights.
* This mirrors a pattern seen in ancient myths where male deities usurp the creative power of female goddesses.

# 59-60

* A Sumerian myth about the creation of humanity illustrates this dynamic, with the god Enki taking over the role of creator from his wife Ninhursag.
* The author concludes that when men create patriarchal systems, conflict and dysfunction are inevitable.

# Chapter 3 The Death Of The Goddess

* This chapter explores the problematic nature of Buddhist mythology for bhikkhunis (Buddhist nuns) and why it continues to hold power today.
* It argues against literalist and modernist interpretations, suggesting that understanding these myths requires entering the realm of myth itself with imagination and sympathy.
* The chapter emphasizes the difficulty of comprehending the power of myth in ancient societies due to fragmented evidence and our modern skepticism towards religion.

#  The Death of God

* This section discusses the historical phenomenon of the "Death of God," arguing that it is not a new concept but rather a recurring theme throughout history.
* It cites examples from Babylonian cuneiform inscriptions, the Bible, and the Ṛg Veda to illustrate the ancient fear of divine abandonment and the questioning of the relationship with the divine.

# The Death of Myth

* This section explores how myth itself is subject to change and eventual death as circumstances evolve and disjuncts arise between myth and reality.
* It argues that the survival of myths is a form of evolution, but their fixed nature can lead to questions and reflections that ultimately take us outside the realm of myth.
* The chapter concludes by discussing the example of the Gilgamesh epic, which highlights the problem of reconciling unchanging myth with changing realities through interpretation and non-literal readings. 




# And for his mother, the goddess Silili, you ordained a weeping that will never end…

* The text begins with a reference to the goddess Silili and her eternal weeping.
* It discusses the conflict between the old feminine divinity and newly assertive masculinity in Gilgamesh's story.
* This conflict is seen as a crisis point for the male hero, leading him on a quest for immortality after the death of his friend Enkidu.

# As gods and goddesses disappear…

* The text explores the fate of gods and goddesses in modern times, suggesting they are often distorted, trivialized, or used to justify depravity.
* It warns against textual fundamentalism as a dangerous force.
* The author proposes that we can still learn from ancient religions by understanding their symbolic language and recognizing the fading embers of the numinous.

# We have lost so very much, yet we have one great advantage: knowledge.

* This section emphasizes the loss of ancient wisdom but highlights the advantage of modern knowledge in understanding religious traditions.
* It suggests that we can glimpse the dying embers of the numinous through studying the continuity of religious symbols.

# Nietzsche crystallized this ancient spiritual crisis when he spoke of the 'Death of God'.

* The text connects the "Death of God" with the earlier disappearance of the Goddess, arguing that we have forgotten her and need to make conscious efforts to remember.
* It traces the evolution of goddesses from ancient figures like Venus to modern representations like Mary.

# Eve is known in the West as the first woman.

* This section focuses on Eve's origins and her connection to ancient goddesses like Asherah and Ishtar.
* It argues that she was originally the wife of Jehovah but was later demonized by patriarchal forces.

# What happened in the Garden was not, as might appear, a personal drama between conflicting parties.

* The text interprets the story of Eve and the serpent symbolically, suggesting that Eve's alienation from her symbols led to suffering and death for humanity.
* It argues that this suffering is necessary for growth and ultimately leads to postmodern feminism.

# So then: men are bad, women are good. Patriarchy destroyed the timeless wisdom of the Divine Feminine…

* This section challenges simplistic feminist narratives about patriarchy and the divine feminine.
* It acknowledges the violence associated with goddesses while emphasizing their role in sacrifice and blood rituals.

# Even more grisly offerings persist in the darker corners of India.

* The text provides a disturbing example of human sacrifice to the goddess Kali, highlighting the persistence of ancient practices in modern times.
* It connects this ritual murder to worldly concerns like wealth, revenge, and fertility.

# Manju Kumari was just one of millions of poor little Indian girls…

* This section focuses on the story of Manju Kumari, a young girl sacrificed to Kali, as a symbol of the dangers of perverse religiosity.
* It argues that her death serves as a warning about the potential for violence inherent in religious beliefs.

# Kālī is a multivalent and complex deity.

* The text explores the multifaceted nature of Kali, acknowledging both her destructive and benign aspects.
* It suggests that the incorporation of darkness and violence in the divine feminine is realistic and healthy.

# The divine has disappeared, and who can blame us if we despair?

* This section reflects on the loss of the divine in modern times, contrasting Buddhist and Western perspectives.
* It argues that for Buddhists, the death of god is not a crisis but an opportunity for ethical responsibility.
* The text concludes by suggesting that the loss of the numinous experience will lead to either superstition or an evolution in our understanding of the sacred.

# Chapter 4 The Little Stick Collector

* Māyā is depicted as a stick-collecting girl who conceived and gave birth to the Bodhisatta in a forest.
* This story, found in the Kaṭṭhahāri Jātaka, connects with deeper mythic themes.
* It shows how Buddhist literature remembers spiritual truths older than itself.
* The tale was adapted by Theravādin storytellers into a moral homily against matrilinear succession.

# The Bhaddasāla Jātaka and the Story of Viḍūḍabha

* This story provides context for the Kaṭṭhahāri Jātaka.
* King Pasenadi sought a bride from the Śākyans but they sent him Vāsabhakhattiyā, daughter of a slave girl, pretending she was noble.
* Their son, Viḍūḍabha, was shunned by the Śākyans upon his return to Kapilavatthu.

* He vowed revenge and destroyed the Śākyans when he became king.
* King Pasenadi was appalled and banished Vāsabhakhattiyā and Viḍūḍabha to the slave quarters.

* The Buddha consoled him, saying that great kings valued patrilinear succession.
* He told the story of King Brahmadatta who had a son with a maiden in a park.
* The king denied his son but was proven wrong by the mother's ring and the child's miraculous display in mid-air.

* The Buddha revealed that the characters in this story were reborn as Suddhodana, Māyā, and the Bodhisatta.

# Traditional Interpretations and Deeper Meanings

* Traditional interpretations focus on a patriarchal message, emphasizing the father's role.
* They highlight the king's responsibility to acknowledge his children.

* The story also alludes to a folk wisdom about motherhood: letting go when necessary.
* Commentators were not interested in mythic structures but used them for moral elevation.
* Their unexpressed motivations are revealed through their connections between characters in the past and present.


# The Significance of Names and Symbols

* The name "Kaṭṭhavāhana" (Stick Carrier) is significant, connecting to Māyā's role as a stick-bearer.
* Māyā is linked to the Tree of Life, symbolizing creation, sustenance, and death.
* The gathering of branches represents the cycle of life and death.

* Māyā embodies both the maiden and the maw of death, similar to Persephone in Greek mythology.

# Hades and Persephone

* Hades, Lord of Death, takes Persephone as his queen.
* Demeter, Persephone's mother, mourns her loss causing the earth to dry up.
* Persephone is allowed to return to the surface for part of the year, explaining the seasons.
* Persephone embodies the threefold aspect of goddess: maiden, wife, and crone.

# The Divine Muse

* Early religious texts were in verse, believed to be divinely inspired. 
* The Muses were female deities who provided poetic inspiration.
* Robert Graves saw poetry as a form of religious invocation of the Muse.
* Both Greek and Buddhist traditions acknowledge divine beings witnessing past events.

# Male Deities as Inspiration

* In some cases, male deities like Brahmā can inspire poets.
* The melancholic origin of poetic inspiration is recognized by modern poets.
* Agni inspired Vedic seers with "the bright word."

# The Feminine Source of Creativity

* Erich Neumann saw the goddess as the source of creative power.
* Plato believed poets were inspired and possessed by divine forces.
* Songs in Jātaka tales mark climactic shifts, reflecting the influence of the Muse.

# Divine Kingship

* Ancient kings were seen as having a divine dimension, affecting the land's fertility.
* The maiden's pregnancy symbolizes the authorization of the kingly lineage.
* Divine seduction is not subject to human laws and can take various forms.

# Ethical Dimensions of Divine Sex

* Euripides criticizes Apollo for his rape of Creüsa, highlighting a shift in ethical perspectives.
* Divine sex is an existential motif with secondary ethical implications.
* Ovid depicts Europa's abduction by Zeus differently than earlier depictions.

# The Overwhelming Power of Divinity

* Roberto Calasso sees divine rape as a shocking and unpredictable encounter with overwhelming power.
* Jung suggests that religious symbols protect us from direct experience of the divine.
* Temples can become prisons for God, trapping him in dogma and ritual.

# Encountering the Divine Outside Religion

* The Bodhisatta's truth comes from venturing outside religious dogma.
* The maiden encounters the king without the protection of religion.
* The king represents the Sky-Father archetype, contrasting with nature cults' immanent divinity.

# Indo-European Patriarchy

* The king embodies the Indo-European patriarchal gods, associated with speed and power.
* This contrasts with the slow rhythms of nature cults and indigenous goddess worship.
* Myths may reflect a conflict between patriarchal invaders and indigenous goddess cultures.




## # The Jātaka

* Immigrants from northwest India were mainly absorbed into the upper castes.
* This suggests their cultural influence was great despite limited numbers.

## # Tribal Roots of Fertility Cults

* Names in the story hint at tribal origins of goddess fertility cults.
* Indo-European sky god impregnating chthonic goddess reflects a shift from feminine to masculine religious orientations.

## # Uncertainty of Paternity

* The uncertainty of paternity is reflected in many stories, both Brahmanical and Buddhist.
* Examples include the Mahābhārata myth of Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā, the Uddālaka Jātaka, and the Upaniṣadic story of Satyakāma.
* In each story, Truth plays a crucial role due to the problem with patrilinear societies: you never really know who the father is.

## # The Rise of Patriarchy

* The concern with paternity elevated Truth to a decisive moral concern.
* Men started compiling lists of 'patriarchs', marking the rise of patriarchy.
* Brahmanical tradition is full of such lists, adopted by early Buddhists for monastic lineage.

## # Mother-Stories vs. King Stories

* Mother-stories speak of life, love, and loss, not trying to prove anything.
* The king in the Kaṭṭhahārī story responds to his child from duty, not love.
* Love arises from abstract justice, not natural psychology.

## # Transition to Manhood

* In the Kaṭṭhahāri Jātaka, the Bodhisatta is suspended between mother and father during a crucial transition to manhood.
* The king rescues him, symbolizing the patriarchal religions' abolition of human sacrifice.

## # Ethical Revolution in Buddhism

* The Bodhisatta persuades kings to sacrifice animals instead of humans, bringing about an ethical revolution.
* This highlights the hypocrisy of those conducting rituals who believe them least.

## # Reciprocal Transgression

* The king enters the goddess's domain, encountering the wild and unpredictable.
* He leaves but cannot escape the cycle of necessity.

## # The Circle of the Ring

* The ring symbolizes wholeness, purity, and eternity.
* It brings the mother back into the sphere of the father.

## # The Wonderful Child

* The child intervenes between male and female, promising a more complete life.
* He allows for fulfillment in each other.

## # Culture vs. Nature

* Throughout the story, the male represents culture, the female nature.
* When the mother stands on Truth, she is raised into a higher level of culture.

## # The Wedding and Adultery

* The wedding symbolizes a cultural construct restricting sexual activity to each other.
* Adultery is seen as a transgression against cultural and personal aspirations.

## # The Foot and Mother Earth

* Grasping the child by the foot connects him to Mother Earth's power.
* This motif appears in many stories, highlighting the mother's influence.

## # Suspension in Ambiguity

* The Wonderful Child remains suspended between mother and father, representing potentiality.
* He eventually returns to the father, who usurps the Creator role from the Earth Mother.

# Chapter 5 A Magic Birth

* The text describes the miraculous events surrounding the birth of Siddhattha (the Buddha) and argues that these events are *dhammatā*, or the way of nature, a universal truth.
* Some miracles, like the baby Bodhisatta's superhuman prodigies, prefigure his future as a Buddha and can be understood as symbolic expressions of natural principles.
* Other miracles, such as the Four Great Kings guarding the mother, are more typical of religious hero births and lack a clear connection to Buddhist teachings.

* The Buddha himself emphasizes mindfulness and meditative practice over miraculous events, suggesting that the rational trumps the mythic in Buddhism.
* Despite this, the mythic aspect of the birth story is undeniable and reflects a sense of inevitability or *dhammatā*. 
* The birth story draws on archetypal patterns found in other religious traditions, such as the stories of fertility deities and the "Four Divine Messengers" episode borrowed from Vipassī's story.

# A Thread Through the Gem

* The image of Māyā seeing the child in her womb "like a thread running through a gem" is particularly suggestive.
* This motif connects to Christian iconography of Mary and Jesus, highlighting the contrast between the magical clarity of the Buddha's birth and the dark obscurity of normal births.
* The thread symbolizes the *bhavanetti*, or "thread of life," representing craving and the construction of identity.

* Weaving is traditionally women's work, and the metaphor of the thread connects to storytelling and the transmission of cultural narratives.
* Māyā's pregnancy and birth are depicted as clean and happy, contrasting sharply with the reality of childbirth. This idealized portrayal reflects a male perspective on womanhood.
* The "virgin birth" trope is common in hero myths and highlights the connection between the Buddha's story and other religious traditions.

# The Birth of Buddha

* Authoritative opinion states that Buddha was born through a virgin mother.
* This concept is not unique to India, as it also appears in Greek mythology with figures like Minerva and Bacchus.
* Examples from Plato's family history and other sources further illustrate the prevalence of virgin births in ancient thought.

# Virginity and Myth

* Physical virginity is not essential to the mythic ideal of a virgin mother; it is a symbol.
* The Catholic Church considers Mary "ever virgin" despite having children, demonstrating the symbolic nature of virginity.
* Mythic virginity represents transcendence of normal cycles of generation and independence from male control.

# Siddhattha's Paternity

* Siddhattha had two fathers: his human father Suddhodana and a divine father who impregnated his mother.
* Suddhodana is seen as the one who raised Siddhattha, but not his literal father, as he was absent during conception.
* This dual paternity led to Siddhattha being known as "The Self-originated Lord."

# The Elephant Symbolism

* The story of Maya conceiving Siddhattha through a white elephant is symbolic of divine impregnation.
* The elephant's phallic imagery emphasizes the supernatural nature of the conception.
* This motif aligns with other mythological stories involving gods taking on animal forms for procreation.

# Oedipal Motif and Its Interpretations

* Siddhattha's relationship with his parents can be interpreted through an Oedipal lens, involving conflict and eventual reconciliation.
* While this interpretation may seem scandalous to some, the Oedipal motif is prevalent in mythology across cultures.
* The legend of Suddhodana attaining enlightenment on his deathbed highlights the triumph of spiritual liberation over worldly concerns.

# Existential Significance of the Birth Narrative

* Ultimately, the Oedipal motif in Buddha's story is existential rather than psychological or political.
* It sets the stage for an extraordinary life by depicting an extraordinary birth.
* The wonder and amazement of Awakening require a similarly incredible backstory.


# Axial Age and Mythological Evolution

* Dramas like Oedipus Rex reflect a shift from spontaneous inspiration to conscious reflection on ancient mythemes.
* Axial legends, including the Buddha's story, bridge the gap between myth and history, and also between myth and the novel.
* They represent a clash between unconscious destiny and conscious ethical values.

# Choice and Destiny in Siddhattha's Life

* Unlike Oedipus, who struggles against fate, Siddhattha actively chooses his path of spiritual development.
* His choices were so profound that they required the framework of myth to encompass them.
* The birth narrative is particularly suited for mythologization because it reflects a time when an infant's experience closely resembles the mythic realm.

# Chapter 6 How Māyā Became A Goddess

* The chapter argues against interpreting the Buddha's birth story as purely historical or miraculous. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the "bad faith" inherent in romanticizing Siddhattha's choices and presenting them as predetermined.
* The author highlights the significance of Māyā's death seven days after giving birth, arguing that this detail acknowledges the inevitability of death and the fundamental truth embodied by myth.

* The chapter analyzes the dialogue between the Buddha and Ānanda regarding Māyā's death, noting the Buddha's subtle shift from personal to universal truths and his emphasis on the impermanence of life.
* It draws parallels between an infant's perception of the world and the concept of *māyā*, suggesting that both involve a blurring of boundaries between subject and object and a magical understanding of reality.

* The chapter explores the complex and ambivalent nature of the mother archetype in mythology, citing examples like Kālī, Isis, and Hecate to illustrate how mothers can be both nurturing and destructive forces.
* It argues that Māyā's archetypal nature is evident in her limited portrayal in early texts, where she primarily serves as a symbol of birth, death, and the cyclical nature of existence.

* The chapter concludes by emphasizing the significance of the number seven in Buddhist tradition, associating it with the unity of birth and death and the mystical logic of sacrifice. It suggests that Māyā's death is not merely a historical event but a symbolic representation of the inevitable connection between life and death.




# Chapter 7 She Who Ate The Children

* Māyā, like Sālabhañjikā, achieves heaven after death.
* Later legend suggests Buddha taught her Abhidhamma.
* Commentators struggle to accept a woman's happiness outside of rebirth as a man.
* Abhidhamma suits this setting as it is divorced from earthly context.

# Other Sources on Māyā

* Some sources portray Māyā closer to her maternal roots.
* Upon hearing of Buddha's enlightenment, milk flowed from her breasts and reached him.
* She spoke verses praising the 'Mother of Demons,' Hārītī.

# The Story of Hārītī

* The Buddha hid Hārītī’s son, who devoured children, making him invisible.
* Desperate, she sought Buddha's help in finding her son.
* Buddha questioned her about her love for her son and her cruelty towards others.
* He urged her to reflect on her actions and reform her heart.
* Hārītī vowed to stop harming children and received the five precepts.

# Māyā’s Lesson

* Māyā tells the story of Hārītī as an example for Buddha.
* She encourages him to act from a place of motherly love, like Ānanda did for women's ordination.

# Hārītī: A Fascinating Figure

* Hārītī is a child-devouring *yakkhinī*, goddess of smallpox, who later became a protector of children.
* Her name might derive from "green" or "plague," reflecting her dual nature.
* She was worshiped throughout India and beyond, even in Japan today.

# Hārītī's Conversion and Legacy

* Despite converting to Buddhism, Hārītī’s ferocious origins are not forgotten.
* She represents early Buddhist worship of wrathful deities.
* Her story highlights the importance of appeasement to avoid her reverting to old ways.

# Other Ogresses in Buddhism

* Hārītī is not alone; other ogresses converted to Buddhism and lived within monasteries.
* Some expressed un-ogreish sentiments, while others were softened by Buddha's teachings.
* *Yakkhinīs* like Piyaṅkara and Punabbasu’s Mother encouraged their children to listen to Dhamma.

# Sānu and His Mother: A Precedent for Hārītī

* The story of Sānu and his mother features a *yakkha* who teaches Dhamma to the novice Sānu.
* This benevolent spirit contrasts with conventional morality, where renunciation is seen as death.
* The mother's support for her son's spiritual endeavors highlights the theme of letting go.

# Kuntī: Parallels to Hārītī

* Two Kuntīs exist: one a wood-nymph from Sri Lanka and another a child-devouring *yakkhinī* from northern sources.
* The *yakkhinī* Kuntī, after conversion, requested a monastery for offerings to ensure children's safety.
* This demonstrates Buddhist adoption of local cults by making deities dependent on Buddhist offerings.



## # Spreading our wingsfurther afield, the Kuntani Jātaka is about a bird—curlew, heron, or stork—who was a messenger for the king of Benares.

* A curlew, heron, or stork served as a messenger for the king of Benares.
* When her young ones were killed by palace boys, she sought revenge by having a tiger kill them.
* She then flew to the Himalayas, stating that friendship was impossible between wrongdoer and wronged.

## # Children Killed, Again.

* The theme of love and abandonment is prevalent in stories featuring divine bird/women, as seen in the tale of Māyā.
* This pattern isn't exclusive to Buddhist texts; the Mahābhārata also tells of Śakuntalā, a child abandoned at birth and raised by vultures.
* The words *kunti* and *śakunti* have roots in pre-Āryan Muṇḍa language, adopted into Vedic language with meanings related to nymphs, tribes, and birds.

## # The Mahābhārata further develops these themes in the story of Mandapāla.

* Mandapāla, a sage seeking peace, believed sons were the path to heaven.
* He transformed into a bird, found a mate named Jarita, and had four learned children.
* While away on an adventure, Agni the Fire God approached, consuming the forest.
* The children begged their mother to save herself, believing they were abandoned by their father.

## # Once more: devotion and abandonment, together with the metamorphosis between human and divine forms.

* The bird, a symbol of fertility, is also depicted as a sage.
* Shamans, from ancient cave paintings to modern times, are often represented as birds.
* The Dhammapada states that the adept's path is trackless, like that of birds in the sky.

## # The Mahābhārata completes this cycle of ambiguity in the story of yet another Kuntī.

* This Kuntī is the mother of the five Pandava princes, who were sheltered by a brahman family while fugitives.
* The town was Ekacakra ('One Wheel'), possibly symbolizing the sun.

## # The mythic cycles keep turning in upon themselves.

* The 'Heron' (*kuntī* and *baka*) represents the protective mother, sacrificer, and child-eater.
* Kuntī saves brahman children from sacrifice to a cannibal monster but sends her son Bhīma as a substitute.
* A brahmans' baby boy, symbolizing Bhīma, intends to kill the monster.

## # The connotations of these birds were similar in the West.


* The crane is associated with Hermes, who bridged gods and humans, suitable for a high-flying bird.
* This connects ancient winged Mesopotamian deities to modern angels.
* The idea of winged deities residing in the sky assumes they are separate from earthly beings.

## # The stork, the crane, and the pelican are all large birds that swoop down to snatch prey.


* They resemble Death itself, striking without warning.
* People feared these birds might abduct children.

## # The stork is an abductor of children, yet it is also the bringer of children, a messenger bridging earth and heavens.

* The same ogress who murders children can become their protector when tamed and propitiated.
* The bird's beak symbolizes violence and sexuality but also provides food from beyond.

## # O indefatigable reader, we fly over distant lands, chasing the tracks of birds in the sky!

* Like a falcon returning to its nest after adventures, we return to Pāṭaliputta to continue our story of Kuntī the wood-nymph.

## # The story is unknown to more sober commentarial accounts, being an elaboration found in the Mahāvaṁsa.

* The text hints at its mythic status with the word *kira* ('it seems').
* This myth likely arose from the adoption of local folk cults into a Buddhist monastery.


## # It is a curious fact that in our earliest concrete record for the personal names of Buddhist monks, several are named after cannibalistic monsters: Ālābagira, Hāritīputa, Kotīputa, and perhaps Gotiputa.

* This theme reappears constantly through sources from this period.
* Two 'Kontiputtas,' sons of Kuntī who were monks in Pāṭaliputta, may be identical to the Kotiputa of inscriptions or hail from the same monastery.


## # Hāritīputa, the 'son of Hārītī', has left us relics in stupas at Sānchī and Andher.

* Since Hārītī and Kuntī are both child-eating *yakkhinīs* with identical mythic backgrounds, their names appearing together on inscriptions is no coincidence.
* The idea that 'children' of Hārītī were offered to the monastery isn't mere speculation; it forms a theme in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya.

## # In the same location as above, until Hārītī had received the three refuges and the five precepts of the Tathāgatha, she was tormented by other *yakṣas*.

* She brought all her children and gave them to the Buddhist community.
* The monks, seeing the children following them, explained their origin to the women of Rājagaha.


## # The women asked the monks: 'Whose children are these?'

* They replied: 'They are the children of Hārītī.'
* The women said: 'Are these then the children of that *yakṣinī* so hateful and wicked?'
* The monks answered: 'She has completely rejected all wickedness, and because of this, all the *yakṣas* torment her. This is why from this time forward she has given us these children.'

## # The women thought 'The *yakṣinī* has rejected her evil intentions and has given her children. Why would we then not give them ours also?'

* They offered their children to the community, but the monks refused.
* The Buddha instructed the monks to accept the children.




# Chapter 8 The King Sacrificed
* In ancient societies, including India, there were practices of sacrificing kings, either periodically or during times of crisis.
* This practice can be traced back to early human culture and is seen as a form of substitute sacrifice where a representative takes the place of the whole community.
*  Frazer's work highlighted this theme in his book "The Golden Bough," drawing examples from various cultures, including India.

* The practice of substitute sacrifice extended beyond kings to include family members, strangers, or even symbolic representations like statues.
* Psychologically, the substitute represents the individual emerging from the archetype and accepting their mortality.
* Examples of substitute sacrifice in Buddhist countries include:
    * Cambodia's annual tradition where a temporary king ruled for three days, symbolizing renewal and abundance.
    * Siam's practice of appointing a temporary king for three days during a specific lunar month. 




# The Temporary King

* This king is a sort of Minister of Agriculture who oversees disputes about fields and rice.
* He performs a ceremony where he plows a field and scatters seed, which spectators scramble for believing it will ensure a plentiful crop.
* The oxen used in the plowing are then fed various foods, and what they eat first is believed to be dear in the following year.

# The Lord of the Heavenly Hosts

* This figure personates the king in another ceremony where he stands on one foot for three hours.
* He is supported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy while Brahmans dance around him, sprinkling water on spectators for good luck.
* If he lets his foot down, it's considered a bad omen and he forfeits his property and family is enslaved.

# Fertility Magic

* The rituals described emphasize fertility magic, where the correct performance ensures the fertility of the soil.
* This type of magic harkens back to the Goddess, even though Brahmans, kings, and monks have taken control of the process.

# The Tibetan Scapegoat

* In Tibet, a monk called the Jalno takes over government for 23 days, acting arbitrarily and collecting fines.
* During this time, Buddhist monks flood Lhasa, creating disorder and confusion.
* After 24 days, the Jalno resumes power for another 10 days, during which a man is chosen as the "King of the Years" and acts as a scapegoat.

# The King of the Years

* The King of the Years is ritually disguised and helps himself to whatever he wants in the marketplace.
* He then debates with the Jalno, representing the Grand Lama, about religious matters.
* They settle their dispute with dice, which are rigged in favor of the Jalno.

# The Scapegoat's Fate

* The King of the Years flees Lhasa pursued by the populace and is confined for seven days at a monastery.
* He then goes into exile in the mountains until he dies or the year is up.
* If he survives, he can return to Lhasa and repeat his role as scapegoat the following year.

# 18

* This section describes a Tibetan ceremony called the Jalno, where a temporary substitute for the Grand Lama takes on the role of scapegoat. 
* The Jalno may be seen as a successor to ancient kings who sacrificed themselves for their people.
* The author suggests that the Jalno's offer to die in place of the King of the Years points to a historical practice of ritual sacrifice.

# 19

* This section offers a contrasting interpretation of the Jalno ceremony, suggesting it was inherited from older Tibetan customs rather than being directly related to the Grand Lama's position.
* The author emphasizes the interconnectedness of Buddhist culture with older cultural practices involving make-believe and ritual.

# 20

* This section argues that the blending of Buddhist teachings with magical and mythical elements has been a continuous process throughout Buddhist history, manifesting in unique ways within different cultures.

# 21

* This section introduces Jātaka stories as examples of sacred regicide in early Buddhism.
* The Maṇicora Jātaka tells the story of a king who is punished by being beheaded after attempting to unjustly kill the Bodhisatta.

# 22

* This section presents another Jātaka story, the Sutana Jātaka, where a man volunteers to be sacrificed to a demon in exchange for the safety of others.
* The Bodhisatta uses his wit and reasoning to convince the demon to abandon human flesh and accept offerings of rice instead.

# 23

* This section introduces a Chinese Dhammapada-style text as further evidence of sacred regicide within early Buddhist thought.

# 24

* This section recounts the story of an official who becomes king but is later murdered by his ministers, only to be reborn as a vengeful ogre.
* The ogre demands human sacrifices until he encounters the Buddha, who converts him to Buddhism and ends the cycle of violence.

# 42

* This section concludes that examples of sacred regicide in Buddhist countries are rooted in ancient traditions and beliefs.
* While Buddhist stories may not always challenge the magical principles underlying regicide, they often emphasize compassion and non-violence as alternatives to sacrifice.

# 28 They do, however, ethicize the magic

* The Jātakas emphasize the king's righteousness as crucial.
* Primitive motifs persist even in later times.
* Buddhist sources endorse substitute sacrifice, focusing on violence rather than superstitious overtones.

# 43 In the real world, the succession of kings is a highly problematic social institution

* Periodic sacrifice of leaders might be gentler than alternatives.
* It deters less devoted aspirants and mitigates patricide.

# 44 In the time of the Buddha, Bimbisāra was killed by his only son Ajātasattu, while Pasenadi was indirectly killed by his son Viḍūḍabha

* The Saṁkicca Jātaka reveals a cyclical pattern of regicide in Ajātasattu's past lives.
* Brahmadatta, a recurring name for kings of Benares, suggests a sacrificial victim.

# 30 Itshould come as no surprise that Ajātasattu was murdered by his son; and he in turn by his son…. Or again, after Aśoka's brother committed the capital crime of donning the imperial regalia, Aśoka offered to turn his crown over to his brother for seven days, following which he must be killed

* The narrative depicts killing as a result of personal ambition for power.
* Colonial practices reflect this fear of patricide.

# 46 The surface narrative of all these stories depicts the killing, not as a ritual or religious act, but as a result of the natural wish of the prince to gain power

*  Frazer's emphasis on the sacred aspect of regicide is criticized for being an external interpretation.
* A more nuanced perspective considers both secular and sacred forces at play.

# 47 A more nuanced perspective emergesin a contemporary study by Märta Salokoski on sacred kingship and regicide in two Owambo kingdoms of Naminia

* Both secular and sacred forces are involved in succession.
* Perspectives differ depending on the source.

# 48 German colonial sources depict the kings as tyrants who arbitrarily dole out life and death for their subjects

* Clan members constantly assassinate kin in the struggle for the throne.

# 49 Local sources say that kingship is passed down by careful selection from eligible Elders of the dying king's clan, with the queen's consent

* The new candidate is ridiculed and humiliated before performing rituals prescribed by diviners or sorcerors.
* He knows he will die when his powers wane at the hands of his successor.

# 50 Salokoski's discussion shows that there was a ritualized, sacred aspect to the death of the king and succession to the throne

* Royal succession was not smooth or clear-cut.
* European interpreters overlooked ritual aspects due to their secular understanding of kingship.

# 51 Our Indian sources, which portray an endemic pattern of regicide, especially by the crown prince, similarly involve both secular and sacred processes

* Mythic structures inform narratives of kingship and succession in legendary stories and supposedly historical events.
* This unconscious form of kingship exists alongside the conscious, secular story.

# 52 The Jungian interpretation hinges on the idea that the king stands for the realized Self

* The sacrifice of the king represents a psychological stage: failure to emerge from the shadow of the engulfing mother.
* Substitute sacrifice allows the king to give up something temporarily while remaining alive and whole.

# 53 The story of the Buddha and Devadatta now takes on a new light

* Devadatta embodies evil qualities that the Buddha has overcome.
* Details in his story suggest conflict beyond personal animosity.

# 54 Devadatta converted Ajātasattu, then the crown prince, to his cause by appearing to him in the form of a boy with a girdle of snakes

* This mastery over the body's form demonstrates Devadatta's might.
* The snake imagery represents the cycle of death and rebirth.

# 55 Elsewhere, the Buddha warns of four things one should not despise because they are young: a fire (which though small may grow out of control), a snake (which though young may still harbour poison), a crown prince (who when he comes to power may extract vengeance for wrongs done to him as a child), and a bhikkhu (who while still young may have great spiritual might)

* Three out of four are present in Devadatta's story: the snake, the prince, and the potential threat.

# 56 Devadatta's identification with the serpent shows that his challenge to the Buddha possesses symbolic force

* The girdle of snakes belongs to dark goddesses like Kālī.
* The snake as a circle represents the cycle of death and rebirth.

# 57 Devadatta presents his plot to the prince: Ajātasattu will kill his father Bimbisāra and become king, while Devadatta will kill the Buddha Gotama and become the new Buddha

* Ajātasattu succeeds in murdering his father, but Devadatta's attempts to murder the Buddha fail.
* This failure is archetypal rather than historical.

# 58 The Buddha is something new

* He stands outside the cycle of death and rebirth enacted in periodic regicide.
* He is a triumphant Master whose emergence from the unconscious is unshakeable.




# Chapter 9 The Real Māyā

*  Māyā is difficult to understand and we have had to rely on associations and connotations to learn about her.
* We tend to see Māyā as an image outside ourselves, but this is just our projection.
* Māyā is a mirage, endowed with a personal life only because we think she must have had one.

# The Mystery of Māyā's History

* Many stories exist about Māyā, but they are likely inventions and should not be taken literally.
* Even the Buddha's family background is shrouded in mystery, with multiple names and variations for his wife.

# The Elusive Nature of Māyā

*  Māyā's name, like her identity, is constantly shifting and changing.
* Attempts to pin down Māyā only lead to further obscurity as she slips from our grasp.

# Māyā as a Universal Force

* Apuleius describes Māyā as the universal Mother, mistress of all elements, and sovereign of all things spiritual.
* She is known by countless names and worshipped in many ways.

# The Allure and Enigma of Māyā

* Māyā is often depicted as the epitome of feminine beauty, but her inner depths remain unknown.
* Like Helen of Troy, Māyā's true nature and thoughts are a mystery.

# The Illusion of Māyā

* Euripides suggests that the Helen seen at Troy was merely an illusion created by Hera.




# Helen and Sītā: Illusions of Love

* The text explores the stories of Helen of Troy and Sītā from the Ramayana, both of whom are presented as illusions or "māyā".
* Herodotus suggests Helen was never in Troy, but rather a phantom created by Hermes, while the real Helen was in Egypt. This rationalizes the Trojan War as being fought over a non-existent woman.

# The Nature of Illusion

* Helen's name has Indo-European roots suggesting "roll, turn," or "cover, hide," connecting her to concepts of duality and reflection.
* Her Indian equivalent, Saraṇyū, also experienced abduction/flight and was associated with twins, further emphasizing the theme of copies and illusion.

# Sītā's Trial by Fire

* The story of Rāma and Sītā involves Sītā's abduction by the demon king Rāvaṇa.
* Despite being rescued, Rāma doubts her purity due to the possibility of forced intimacy, leading him to reject her.
* Sītā proves her innocence through a trial by fire but is ultimately embraced by the Earth Goddess, suggesting an escape from the constraints of human perception and judgment.

# The Illusion Within

* The *Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa* introduces the concept of Māyāsītā, an illusionary double who was abducted while the real Sītā remained hidden in fire.
* This narrative device highlights the idea that even heroes like Rāma can be unaware of the true nature of reality and are subject to illusions.

# The Power of Perception

* Both Helen and Sītā's stories emphasize the role of perception in shaping reality. Their beauty and virtue become intertwined with the beholder's gaze, creating a complex interplay between illusion and truth.
* Carol Gilligan argues that idealized and degraded images of women reflect a societal loss of connection with their true selves, leading to the worship of an image rather than a person.

# Cupid and Psyche: Love Beyond Surface

* The myth of Cupid and Psyche explores the theme of love transcending superficial appearances.
* Psyche, initially worshipped for her beauty, is ultimately loved by Cupid for her soul after she overcomes trials set by Venus.
* This story suggests that true love requires going beyond surface-level attraction to connect with a person's inner essence.

# Conclusion

* The text concludes that genuine connection and love are built through overcoming challenges and embracing vulnerability. It emphasizes the importance of seeing beyond illusions and recognizing the inherent worth of individuals.

# The better known classical myths—Oedipus, Agamemnon, Troy—place conflict at the center

* Freud and his followers emphasized these stories, developing a masculinized psychology.
* Greek myths also end with forgiveness, showcasing reconciliation even in tragedy.

# Perhaps the most astonishing transformation in all Greek tragedy is that of Oedipus himself

* Exiled and blinded, Oedipus wanders alone until his daughter Antigone stays by his side.
* He accepts his fate and guides Theseus to a safe place before dying.

# The extraordinary Kusa Jātaka twists the theme once again

* Prince Kusa, wise but ugly, marries the beautiful Princess Pabhāvatī under the condition they cannot see each other.
* Their ruse is uncovered, leading to trials and adventures where Kusa proves his worth through humble tasks.

# The conventions of the fairy tale are playfully undermined

* True beauty is revealed when the princess humbles herself, transcending vanity.
* The hero's journey focuses on domestic work rather than traditional masculine feats.

# *Māyā* means deceit

* It represents the falseness of the world and the absence of women's inner lives in male-dominated stories.
* In India, *māyā* evolved into a philosophical concept, the creative play by which the Absolute manifests the world.




# Chapter 10 Let'S Play

* Playing with myth doesn't undermine it, but brings it to life.
* The playful tone in mythology is evident in Buddhist texts like the Suttas and stories about figures like Sāriputta and Sakka.
* This playfulness stems from the dreamlike nature of myth and ritual, which originates in imagination and fantasy.

# Myth as Play

* A literal interpretation of myth leads to "textual fundamentalism," a rigid and destructive approach that ignores the creative spirit of the texts.
* True engagement with myth involves intuition, humor, and creativity, acknowledging its seriousness while recognizing its playful nature.

# Ritual Play

* Vedic sacrifice, like other forms of ritual, embodies the paradox of life and death through play.
* Rituals often involve real-world consequences, redistributing resources and shaping social structures.
* Examples include the dice game in the Mahābhārata, Aztec ball games, and the Jātakas, where characters encounter life-changing events during play.

# Play and Society

* Play temporarily dissolves hierarchies and allows for spontaneous creativity.
* Buddhist culture, despite its austere image, incorporates ritual play into monastic life.
* Ancient festivals like carnivals and saturnalia allowed for social inversion and the expression of chaos within a controlled environment.

# From Ritual to Bungee Jumping

* The history of bungee jumping can be traced back to the "Land Diving" ritual on Pentecost Island.
* This ritual, originally involving human sacrifice to a goddess, evolved into a fertility rite and initiation ceremony for young men.
* While tourism has commercialized the practice, it still retains elements of its original significance for the local community.

# Play in Modern Buddhism

* Modernist Buddhism often neglects the playful and mythical aspects of Buddhist tradition, focusing instead on rational teachings.
* The emphasis on rationality can lead to a denial of myth and a loss of the deeper meaning embedded within traditional stories.
* It is important to recognize the value of both reason and play in understanding and experiencing Buddhism.

# Our Task: Integration

* Buddhism contains irrational elements often ignored by modern interpretations.
* Myth plays a significant role in Buddhist culture but is largely unaddressed in both traditional and modern studies.

# Jungian Insights

* The unconscious communicates through universal symbols, expressed individually through dreams and culturally through myth.
* While religions share symbolic patterns, their meanings are unique to their contexts.
* Dismissing myth as irrational actually highlights its power over us.

# The Unconscious and the Buddha

* The rational mind emerges from a vast unconscious, likened to a "dark mass of ignorance" by the Buddha.
* The unconscious is not threatening but seeks acknowledgment and understanding.
* It communicates through symbols, requiring a playful engagement rather than reasoning.

# Myth's Enduring Presence

* Despite academic claims of its absence, myth continues to shape our lives through cultural practices and popular culture.
* Recognizing mythic presence in Buddhist experience is crucial for deeper engagement.

# The Power and Peril of Myth

* Modern psychology has seen a decline in the study of myth, leading to a diminished understanding of its influence.
* Myths not only reflect but also contribute to shaping our psyches.
* In a secular world, myths can be misused to fuel fundamentalism, posing a threat to global stability.




# Chapter 11 Perception, Symbol, Myth

* This chapter explores the concept of *saññā*, translated as "perception," within a Buddhist context.
* It argues that *saññā* can be analyzed as a social aspect of perception and is crucial for understanding myth.
* The five aggregates (*khandhas*) are introduced as a framework for understanding the components of experience: form, feeling, perception, volitional activities, and awareness.

# The Five Aggregates

* The five aggregates represent the "stuff of life" and are used to classify theories about the Self.
* Form refers to physical reality, but also includes mental imagery and imagined objects.
* Feeling encompasses the basic tones of experience: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
* Perception filters and makes sense of experience through recognition and association with past experiences.

# Saṅkhāra and Viññāṇa

* *Saṅkhāra* relates to volition, ethical choices, and future-oriented thought. It is a catch-all category for miscellaneous mental factors.
* *Viññāṇa* represents pure awareness, distinct from the other aggregates. It is the knowing aspect of experience.

# Evolution of Identity

* The five aggregates represent a hierarchical structure and an evolutionary process of identity formation.
* This evolution can be traced in both general development (from inorganic matter to purified awareness) and individual development (from basic needs to self-actualization).

# Saññā: Perception, Recognition, and Symbolism

* *Saññā* is the mental function that allows us to recognize patterns and make sense of experience through past associations.
* It forms the basis for communication, language, and conceptual thought.
* *Saññā* can also be understood as "contract" or "symbol," connecting experiences and concepts.

# Saññā in Buddhist Psychology

* *Saññā* bridges sense awareness and thinking, preparing raw data for conceptual operations.
* It is not limited to physical perception but also includes linguistic contact through the mind.
* Ethical discussions emphasize that perception may not always equate with reality, highlighting the importance of accurate perception.

# The Importance of Saññā

* *Saññā* simplifies experience, allowing us to navigate a world of overwhelming sensory input.
* It is essential for cognitive functioning and allows us to recognize patterns and make sense of our surroundings.

# Perception (*Saññā*)

*  *Saññā* is a mental faculty that involves recognizing and interpreting sensory data.
* It can be used for good or bad intentions.

* In meditation, *saññā* helps cultivate insights like impermanence.
* It also guards against misperceptions, such as seeing the impermanent as permanent.

# The Function of Perception

* Buddhaghosa compares *saññā* to a carpenter recognizing timber, allowing for repeated identification.
* Asaṅga defines *saññā* as recognizing and knowing various things.
* Vasubandhu emphasizes *saññā*'s role in grasping signs (*nimitta*) within sense objects.

# The Nature of Perception

* *Saññā* involves grasping images or signs, forming an immediate apprehension of overall patterns.

* It is a "seeming" aspect of things, influenced by past experiences and cultural conditioning.
* The Buddha likened *saññā* to a mirage due to its illusory nature.

# Perception in Myth, Symbol, and Ritual

* *Saññā* plays a crucial role in creating shared myths, symbols, and rituals.
* These constructs rely on repeated recognition of signs that convey meaning within a community.

* Humans have developed symbolic culture through *saññā*, enabling communal identity and higher achievements.

# The Social Construction of Reality

* Knight et al. argue that symbolic culture creates collective fantasies without direct perceptual counterparts, sustaining communities.
* Perception distorts sensory information to suit individual interests, while humans develop language and culture for shared interpretation.

* This communal map expands individual concern beyond the self, enabling self-sacrifice and social control through beliefs and values.

# Symbolic Culture and Belief

* Symbolic culture creates a world beyond senses, including concepts like good and evil, cosmologies, and social realities.
* These symbols gain meaning through social authorization, historically through rituals or divine authority.

* The focus is not on the ontological existence of these symbols but on their role in creating collective beliefs.

# Ritual and the Dissolution of Self

* Brahmanic texts detail mystical correspondences between ritual symbols and the cosmos, aiming to connect individuals with the universe.
* Ritual expands awareness beyond the self, binding people through cultural continuity and dissolving individual preoccupation.

* The extreme form is seen in sacrificial rituals where the victim willingly becomes one with the symbol, transcending personal identity.

# The Power of Seeming

* *Saññā* involves a contract or agreement between individuals, based on persuasion.
* In sacrificial rituals, the victim's "acquiescence" transforms them into the symbol, blurring the line between self and sacrifice.

* This "seeming" becomes reality through ritualistic adornments and identification with the chosen deity or concept.

# Chapter 12 On Using Jung

* Jung's 'archetypes' are seen as inherent images in the psyche that pre-exist the conscious mind.
* The archetypes themselves are not directly observed; we experience specific representations of these universal, timeless concepts.
* One philosophical difficulty with archetypes is their elusive ontological status.

# Archetypes and Buddhism

* From a Buddhist perspective, archetypes can be understood as accumulated patterns re-experienced throughout the cycle of rebirth.
* When we encounter experiences following familiar patterns, *saññā* recognizes them, evoking the archetype.
* Jung suggests that the Buddhist meditative experience of rebirth refers to the same psychological reality as archetypes.

# Archetypes and Love at First Sight

* Perhaps the most dramatic evocation of the archetype is 'love at first sight'.
* Buddhists attribute this power to a long-standing connection from past lives.
* Jungians suggest it occurs when individuals recognize their archetypal male/female figures in each other.

# Universality of Archetypes

* The universality of archetypes arises not from 'primordial determinants' but because life follows regular patterns like birth, aging, and death.
* These experiences, repeated countless times, lose individual features and appear as timeless universals.

# Postmodern Critique

* Postmodern critics like Marina Warner argue that stories and myths can only be understood in their lived context.
* They criticize archetypal theory for being ahistorical and reinforcing gender stereotypes.

# Addressing the Critique

* While acknowledging the importance of historical context, it's important not to dismiss the relevance of archetypes to broader questions of humanity.
* Jungian analysis focuses on the mythic domain of *saññā*, offering valuable insights into this realm.

# Pre/Trans Fallacy

* Ken Wilber's 'pre/trans fallacy' highlights the confusion between primitive 'pre-rational' and evolved 'trans-rational' states.
* The reductionist fallacy equates higher consciousness with pre-rational states, while the elevationist fallacy mistakes primitive states for transcendent ones.

# Applying Jungian Analysis

* Jungian analysis is valuable for understanding the mythic domain but doesn't explain higher states of consciousness.
* We should be cautious about misusing Jung and avoid making claims unsupported by Buddhist teachings.

# 13 In other words, the King is no more—and no less—than a normal, well-adjusted adult.

* The Buddha rejected the King archetype before his quest for Awakening.
* This distinguishes him from other kings on spiritual quests who expected to return to the throne.
* Accession to the throne represents a shift in identity from tradition-bound group to future-building individual.

# 24 Modernist Buddhism identifies itself with the two highest aggregates, *saṅkhārā* and viññāṇa.

* This strategy emphasizes reason, intellect, and awareness.
* It aims to enhance personal responsibility and purify awareness.

# 14 This strategy has its uses, but it can lead to an anti-intellectual critique of 'thinking too much'.

* *Viññāṇa* seeks primacy over *saṅkhārā*.
* Those who haven't learned to think properly may be disadvantaged by this approach.

# 25 Modernist Buddhism aims to divorce itself from myths and legends found in other religions.

* Buddhist sacred books are seen as containing facts, while others contain myths.
* This creates a dichotomy between 'real Buddhism' and what is deemed not real.

# 26 There is a dichotomy in our relationship with Buddhist heritage.

* Traditional teachings use Jātaka stories to illustrate spiritual or ethical meanings.
* These stories can be ambiguous and used for both good and bad purposes.
* When cut off from their roots, they can be misused by storytellers who disclaim responsibility.

# 27 Academic studies of Buddhism focus on 'hard facts' and neglect questions of meaning.

* They become specialized and avoid certain questions deemed inappropriate.
* Buddhist scholars sometimes forget they are in the humanities department.

# 28 There is a lack of communication between academics and the Buddhist community.

* Academics produce studies ignored by Buddhists, while Buddhists continue their way of life without engaging with academic insights.

# 29 The 'hard facts' of Buddhist studies have relevance for the spiritual search.

* Questions of meaning are indispensable for making sense of data provided by Buddhist studies.

# 30 Buddhist modernism is a historical development that emerged from colonialism.

* Buddhists used 'masculine' tools to identify and establish Buddhist traits within their culture.
* This led to the reification of an all-male Sangha as representative of 'real' Buddhism.

# 31 While some regret the passing of syncretistic native Buddhism, modernist Buddhism has allowed Buddhism to survive and thrive in the modern age.

* Rational mindfulness practices have found acceptance in secular environments.
* However, modernist Buddhism has not yet learned how to integrate lower levels of experience.

# 32 Modernist Buddhism is embarrassed by superstition and meaningless ritual in traditional cultures.

* It cannot reduce the Dhamma to a philosophy, morality, or meditation technique.
* The Dhamma must be an integrated practice involving all five aggregates.

# 33 Jungian archetypes have been criticized under postmodernism for stemming from a hegemonic discourse.

* They impoverish diversity and are seen as projections by academics who study 'primitives' without living among them.

# 34 Universal stages of development have also been criticized.

* Theorists like Frazer saw some societies as objectively worse than others, assuming they needed to become more like Westerners.
* This is seen as patronizing and not supported by evidence.

# 35 While the idea of stages of development has been critiqued, it's not entirely dead.

* Frazer showed that seemingly bizarre beliefs and practices were not as alien as thought.
* He demonstrated similarities between Christian and 'primitive' beliefs, contributing to a more 'human' psychology.

# 36 Postmodernism focuses on diversity but neglects questions about what makes us human.

* We need to address both the similarities and differences in human experience.

# 37 The Buddha's concept of dependent origination offers a way to balance unity and diversity.

* We should look for connections between local and universal myths, understanding how practices work within specific contexts.
* We need to understand both the specific meanings of stories and their relation to fundamental concerns of the human psyche.

# 38 Hegemonic monomyth theory is elevationist, while postmodern theory is reductionist.

* Both perspectives have their place, and our choice should depend on the question we are interested in answering.

# 39 A comparative approach to studying Buddhist myth is essential despite postmodern critiques.

* It asks questions that postmodernism cannot answer.
* As a Westerner, I am fascinated by myths from my own culture.

# 40 Some argue that the study of myths should use perspectives and interpretations within the culture.




# Those living in a faith community vary tremendously in their own experience of their religion

* People experience religious texts and practices differently depending on context (e.g., time period, setting).
* Understanding the original context of religious stories is important but impossible to fully recapture.

# All mythology is comparative

* Ancient myths often involve pantheons of gods gathered from various cultures' spiritual experiences.
* Indic myth exemplifies this with its multitude of deities constantly interacting and evolving.
* Buddhist myth also shows this influence, as seen in Greco-Buddhist art.

# The more profound significance of the comparative approach

* Globalization is leading to a merging of Western and Eastern cultures.
* This makes it important for both Westerners and traditional Buddhists to understand each other's approaches to mythology.

# Studying this material on a comparative basis

* Helps integrate modern and traditional Buddhism.
* Integrates different aspects of our psyches.

# Dhamma is different from new religious movements precisely because of its depth

* Dhamma has provided meaning and Awakening for millions over 2500 years.
* This historical depth is mediated through saññā, which provides a sense of continuity.

# Such historical continuity inevitably brings its problems

* Our age is different, requiring different answers to timeless questions about embodying Dhamma.
* Even internal aspects like meditation are influenced by cultural context and language.

# Continuity in Buddhist culture

* Is not just textual, ideological, or mystical but also institutional through the monastic Sangha.
* All Buddhist cultures have both lay and monastic wings.
* The monastic Sangha is a community of spiritual seekers and a projection screen for Buddhist ideals. 




# Chapter 13 The Dhamma Of Gender

* Monastic institutions have marginalized or eliminated the role of women, denying them access to resources despite often being their donors. This disempowerment is a painful reality for women.

* Modern Buddhism avoids discussing gender issues by focusing on ordination procedures or suggesting that women simply meditate. These tactics deflect attention from the real issue: women's survival and support in their practice.

* The bhikkhuni Sangha, a community of nuns, is a social construct defined through rituals and acceptance within the Buddhist community. However, its myth of origins is fractured and reflects the ambiguous attitude towards nuns in modern Buddhism.

* Understanding the problem of gender identity requires delving into the realm of symbols and archetypes, as it's rooted in mythic narratives.

* Addressing gender issues requires examining them at the appropriate level, rather than getting bogged down in minutiae or avoiding difficult conversations.

# The Ancient World & Gender

* Gender issues are present throughout Buddhist history, and any text from the past will likely raise questions about gender sensitivity.

* While acknowledging the chauvinism of the ancient world, there is also evidence of a more balanced and feminine-oriented society in prehistory, particularly during the Neolithic period.

* This perspective suggests that early societies may have had a closer connection to nature through the feminine divine, which was later suppressed by patriarchal cultures.

# Gender & Society

* While some argue for a "Golden Age" of matriarchy, it's important to avoid projecting modern values onto the past and acknowledge the complexities of different historical contexts.

* Both masculine and feminine biases can be essential for societal evolution, and societies with literate and philosophical cultures have historically been dominated by men.

* The relationship between goddess worship and women's status is complex. While praising women, such practices may not necessarily improve their lives in reality.

# Power & Gender

* Traditional notions of power often overlook the subtle forms of influence wielded by women, particularly in hunter-gatherer societies where they shape the character of men through upbringing.

* The debate between "essentialism" and "social construction" in gender studies highlights the ongoing struggle to understand the interplay between biology and culture in shaping gender identity.

* While acknowledging potential neurological differences between genders, it's crucial to focus on why we are so fixated on these differences rather than celebrating our shared humanity.


# Gender & Buddhist Teachings

* Early Buddhist texts approach gender change pragmatically and non-judgmentally, offering guidelines for dealing with spontaneous sex changes within the Sangha.


# Sex Change and Gender Transformation

* Sex change is treated as a procedural matter in Buddhist monastic management.
* Monks and nuns are treated equally regarding sex change and offenses.
* Early Buddhist texts view gender as changeable, not fixed.

# Gender Differences

* Early Buddhism does not subscribe to the idea of innate gender differences.
* Birth as a man or woman is seen as a result of karma, not necessarily bad karma in past lives.
* The nature of gender differences should be researched but understood within the context of this life, not as fixed forever.

# Gendered Texts and Cultures

* Buddhist texts and cultures are deeply gendered, requiring an insider-outsider perspective for understanding.
* Cultural associations like "masculinity" and "femininity" are not absolute realities but sets of connotations.
* These archetypal concepts inform our perception of individuals as male or female without defining them completely.


# Understanding Gender in Buddhism

*  "Masculinity" and "femininity" should be understood as cultural constructs relevant to the specific Buddhist context. 
* Analyzing gender in modern Buddhism requires understanding its historical construction.

# Chapter 14 Mythic Fact, Historic Fiction

* Myth is more than we can know and inquiry requires acknowledging our ignorance.
* Reading myth is like seeing a reflection of ourselves; we see what we want to see. Myths reveal little about underlying reality.
* History relies on facts and inferences while myths tell timeless stories.
* Ancient Indian myths, such as the Rāmāyaṇa, are retold in various versions, highlighting their enduring nature.
* Myth is not true or false but a reflection of humanity's multifaceted nature.

# Myth and Logic

* Mythical logic operates differently from everyday logic.
* Claude Lévi-Strauss studied how myths create opposing concepts like sacred/profane and raw/cooked.
* Myths explore paradoxes, such as life/death and incest taboos, through riddles and multiple perspectives.
* The Kuṇāla Jātaka illustrates how origin myths can be used rhetorically to justify conflict.

# Buddhist Mythology and Gender

* Buddhist mythology presents various narratives about choice, particularly between renunciation and home life.
* Different tales offer nuanced perspectives on this dilemma, reflecting the complexity of truth.
* Buddhist scriptures contain both positive and negative portrayals of women, highlighting societal tensions.
* The story of Mahāpajāpatī and the *garudhammas* explores the establishment of order in relations between genders.

# Ona Mythology: A Case Study

* The Ona people of Tierra del Fuego had a myth explaining their social structure.
* In this myth, women initially possessed powerful magic, but men revolted and killed them.
* Men created their own secret Lodge to maintain control and invented demons to frighten women.
* This story highlights the use of mythology to justify power dynamics and social order.

# 19 The mythological *apologia*

* The Ona tribe's explanation for their unusual lodge resembled the biblical Adam blaming Eve for sin.
* This highlights how fabricated mythologies can influence beliefs and civilization.

# 20 The men of the Ona felt so threatened by the women that they resorted to inventing fake magic powers to protect themselves from the women's real magic.

* Parallels exist with Buddhist bhikkhuni Sangha creation myths, where bhikkhunis supposedly possess destructive power.
* This raises questions about how such beliefs gain acceptance.

# 21 Fabrications for personal gain are not limited to remote tribes.

* Buddhist texts describe Brahmans performing rituals without believing in them.

# 22 Even Buddhist monks, despite vows of truthfulness, have created false stories.

* The Dhammakāya movement exemplifies this with its invented mythology of battling cosmic forces.

# 23 Applying modern ethical standards to the past is complex.

* Origin stories in Buddhist Vinayas are recognized as inventions, not factual accounts.
* Different versions of these stories exist, highlighting their fictional nature.

# 24 Buddhist monastic codes contain numerous invented stories.

* A rule restricting nuns from crossing rivers alone has various contradictory origin stories.

# 25 Instructions for inventing stories appear in some Vinaya texts.

* This raises questions about whether Buddhist monastics are guilty of lying.

# 26 Deliberate falsehoods are not always lies if the intention is not to deceive.

* Such narratives can be considered fiction, which has its own meaning and value.

# 27 The bhikkhuni origin story might be a fictional element within the larger Buddhist myth.

* This myth reflects the recurring theme of the disappearance of the divine feminine.

# 29 Myth differs from fiction in its communal creation and shared ownership.

* Fiction is created by individuals, while myths evolve through collective retellings.

# 30 Myths embody the dreams and life-story of a community.

* Destroying myths destroys communal identity, values, language, and connection to the past.

# 31 Myths provide a sense of continuity and meaning that historical facts cannot.





# Chapter 15 The Other First Bhikkhuni

* This chapter tells the story of Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā, a Jain nun who became the first Buddhist nun according to this account.
* The author argues that Bhaddā's story is often overlooked because she doesn't fit conventional ideas about what a nun should be. 
* The chapter challenges the widely accepted claim that Mahāpajāpatī was the first bhikkhuni, pointing out the lack of reliable evidence for this assertion.

# The Story of Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā

*  Bhaddā encounters the Buddha and initially tries to obstruct his path, challenging him about his teachings.
* The Buddha explains that his teachings lead to liberation for all beings, not just men. 
* Impressed by the Buddha's words, Bhaddā requests ordination as a bhikkhuni.

#  Bhaddā's Enlightenment and Ordination of Other Nuns

* After receiving ordination, Bhaddā achieves enlightenment while washing her feet.
* Five other Jain nuns witness Bhaddā's transformation and also request ordination.
* The Buddha ordains these five nuns as well, making a total of six bhikkhunis.

#  Bhaddā's Legacy

* Bhaddā is presented as a model for Buddhist nuns, demonstrating fearlessness and challenging male authority.
* The author highlights the lack of recognition given to Bhaddā's story and the challenges faced by Buddhist nuns today.


# Sources on Bhikkhunis in Early Buddhism

* The chapter lists six main sources that provide information about bhikkhunis during the Buddha's time:
    * **The Therīgāthā:** A collection of verses attributed to awakened nuns.
    * **The Bhikkhunī Saṁyutta:** Includes verses from the Therīgāthā within a narrative context.
    * **Suttas in the Nikāya/Āgama collections:** Occasionally feature bhikkhunis, offering glimpses into their lives and experiences.

# The Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga and Bhikkhunī Khandhaka

* Compiled later than other Vinayas.
* Contain additions by monks but possibly retain traces of original bhikkhuni oral literature.

# The Therī-Apadāna

* Late canonical period text.
* Expanded versions of bhikkhuni lives from the Therīgāthā.
* Details episodes from their past lives.
* Post-dates Buddha by several centuries.
* Record of nuns' hagiography in developing Buddhism.

# Commentaries and Later Legends

* Provide information 500–1000 years after Buddha.
* Stem partly from earlier traditions.

# Bhaddā’s Story

* Verses found in Therīgāthā or Therī-Apadāna.
* Therīgāthā verses likely represent Bhaddā's own words.
* Therī-Apadāna stems from a later phase of development.

# Prose Background and Style

* Firmly in the style of Vinaya Khandhakas.
* References to Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Kassapa ascetics, etc. confirm this.
* Setting in Rājagaha confirmed by early verses.
* Stylistic idioms support this affinity.
* Teachings attributed to Buddha found elsewhere in the canon.

# Comparative Study and Invention

* Narrative details often differ across Buddhist texts while teachings remain identical.
* Much of even early texts is likely invention, not literally historical.
* Nothing should be accepted blindly; redactors' perspectives must be considered.

# Bhaddā’s Verses and Commentary

* Realistic account of Bhaddā starts with her own verses, likely the only genuine record.
* Commentarial story contradicts verses: set in Sāvatthī, Sāriputta as main teacher.
* Commentary changes ordination mode: Buddha says "Go" instead of "Come".

# 'Come Bhikkhuni' Ordination

* Pali Vinaya mentions "Come, bhikkhuni!" ordination in its basic definition.
* Commentator Dhammapāla argues against it, claiming women lack merit.
* Other traditions remember this ordination: Puggalavāda Vinaya, Avadānaśātaka, Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, Haimavata school Vinaya, Ni Jie-mo, Dharmapāda Avadāna Sūtra.

# Evidence of Enthusiasm

* Despite denials and omissions from official accounts, Vinayas and nuns' voices attest to "Come bhikkhuni" ordination.
* It may not be the original ordination, but it reflects enthusiasm for bhikkhuni ordination.




# Chapter 16 A Buddhist Femme Fatale

* The author admits to fabricating Bhaddā's story in the previous chapter but defends their creative liberties as a way of exploring the narrative possibilities.
* They express dissatisfaction with traditional commentaries on Bhaddā, which they believe attempt to rewrite history.
* The author suggests that their fictionalized version might be closer to the truth than the official account, citing details like the use of the "Come, bhikkhu" formula and the setting in Rājagaha.

#  The Missing Bhikkhuni Ordination

* The Catuṣpariṣat Sūtra, which recounts the first bhikkhu ordinations, is incomplete and likely had a section on bhikkhuni ordination removed.
* This removal might explain the text's fragmented nature and suggests that the story of the first bhikkhuni ordination was deliberately suppressed.

# Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā: A Story of Love and Revenge

* The chapter introduces Bhaddā, a wealthy young woman who falls in love with Sattuka, a condemned criminal.
* She bribes authorities to release him and marries him, but he betrays her by attempting to steal her jewels.
* In a clever act of self-defense, Bhaddā pushes Sattuka off a cliff, killing him.

# Parallels and Archetypes

* The story of Bhaddā is compared to the Sulasā Jātaka, which features a courtesan who kills a robber who tries to murder her.
* Both stories highlight the theme of female agency and intelligence in overcoming dangerous situations.

# From Myth to Journalism: The Evolution of a Story

* The chapter traces the evolution of the Bhaddā story through various retellings, noting how it becomes more grounded in reality over time.
* It discusses the Kaṇavera Jātaka, where the Bodhisatta is depicted as a murderous bandit, showcasing the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of Buddhist narratives.

# The Story of Bhaddā

* Tells the transition from girlhood to womanhood.
* Compares to Western stories like Beauty and the Beast or Bluebeard.
* Her story has parallels in other cultures, like the Scottish ballad of May Colven.

# Themes and Interpretations

* Explores the dangers and uncertainties of spiritual development.
* Codes information about the expectations placed on women.
* Highlights the conflict between arranged marriages and partnerships based on desire.
* Presents a woman who defies societal norms and pursues her own desires.

# The Role of Men and Women in the Story

* Male minstrels tell a woman's tale, reflecting patriarchal motifs.
* Verses attributed to women suggest an oral tradition passed down among them.
* Bhaddā's story may have originated as a "old wives' tale."

# Ethical Considerations

* Bhaddā kills her husband in self-defense, raising ethical questions about killing.
* The story seems to bypass these ethical concerns, focusing instead on her cleverness and resourcefulness.
* This pre-ethical perspective aligns with the ambiguous role of the Bodhisatta as a condemned thief.

# Bhaddā's Journey

* After killing her husband, she becomes a wanderer seeking spiritual enlightenment.
* She challenges wise men to debates, demonstrating her intelligence and determination.
* Ultimately, she meets Sāriputta, who stumps her with a simple question about the nature of "the one."
* This encounter leads her to the Buddha and her attainment of arahantship.

# Contradictory Accounts

* The traditional account of Bhaddā's debating career is found in other stories, suggesting a stereotypical narrative.
* Her own verses and the Therī-Apadāna offer a different version, focusing on her encounter with a decaying hand.
* This highlights the existence of multiple, sometimes contradictory, accounts within Buddhist tradition.

# Chapter 17 The Weaving Of The Web

* Robes are essential to Buddhist monasticism, signifying dependence on lay support and representing a monk's connection to the world.
* Offering robes is a traditional act of generosity towards monks, symbolizing material support and respect.
* Bhaddā praises a layman for offering her a robe, reversing typical gender roles associated with cloth offerings.

# The Robe Offering and Ordination Request

* The Buddha deflects Mahāpajāpatī's offer of robes, encouraging her to give them to the Sangha instead.
* This deflection is not meant to be disrespectful but aims to establish a new dynamic between them, emphasizing the Sangha over individual relationships.
* Linking the robe offering and ordination request suggests a pattern of supplication common in both Buddhist and Brahmanical traditions.

# The Significance of the Robe Offering

* The robe offering highlights Mahāpajāpatī's attachment to the Buddha and potential neglect of the Sangha.
* This episode reflects broader challenges faced by the Buddha's family members integrating into the Sangha, often stemming from pride and attachment.
* The *garudhammas*, rules imposed on nuns, may have been initially intended for Mahāpajāpatī specifically to address her personal issues.

# Maternal Attachment and Cloth Symbolism

* Ānanda invokes the Buddha's childhood dependence on Mahāpajāpatī's milk, highlighting a maternal connection.
* The Buddha depersonalizes this reference, suggesting a need to move beyond infantile attachments.
* Cloth holds symbolic weight as a reminder of comfort, family, and physical boundaries, making it a powerful object in monastic life.

# Chapter 18 Fears Of The Future

* This chapter discusses the prediction that nuns will destroy Buddhism, found in the Mahāpajāpatī story.
* It argues that this prediction is irrational and based on unconscious associations rather than reason or evidence.
* The author suggests that the prediction reflects a fear of Buddhism's decline prevalent at the time it was written, likely centuries after the Buddha's death.

# The Importance of Bhikkhunis

* This section emphasizes the importance of bhikkhunis (female monastics) for the longevity and health of Buddhism.
* It cites various early Buddhist texts that highlight the essential role of bhikkhunis in preserving and spreading the Dharma.
* The author contrasts these authentic early texts with the later, unfounded prediction about nuns destroying Buddhism. 


# Most Marks Are Straightforward Signs

* Most marks are straightforward signs of physical perfection.
* Some marks range from the odd to the bizarre.

# The Buddha's Life and Bhikkhunis

* The text says that the Buddha lived for the happiness of many in past lives.
* It states that bhikkhunis are an essential part of Buddhism.
* Many passages treat bhikkhunis with dignity as part of the Buddhist community.

# De-Rationalizing the Texts

* When texts say women cause decay and disease, the author can no longer recognize the Buddha's voice.
* The process of de-rationalizing starts within the Mahāpajāpatī story itself.
* The first danger of ordaining women is that a village with few men and many women is weak and at risk from thieves and bandits.

# Fear of Disappearance

* The dominant fear expressed in these texts is the disappearance of the Dhamma-Vinaya.
* Individually, they know it must end, but as a community, they still fear it.

# Challenges Faced by the Buddha

* Towards the end of his life, the Buddha faced unprecedented challenges.
* His chief disciples died, and great lay supporters passed away.
* Kings who supported him also died, their thrones usurped by violent sons.

# The Buddha's Death Scene

* The Buddha's death scene is remembered and celebrated in story and artwork.
* There is a strange dissonance between the enlightened behavior of individuals and a collective mind that is dis-integrated.

# Tension Spurred by Trauma

* The tension spurred many developments in later Buddhism as the community attempted to come to terms with the root trauma.
* The history of Buddhism evidences an unquenchable thirst to bring back the Buddha.

# Dichotomy in History

* On the surface, the efforts taken to preserve Buddhism are entirely sensible and admirable.
* But something else is going on, something barely suppressed behind the traditions.

# Fear of Death Inscribed

* In these stories, the fear of death is inscribed into the Buddha's passing away.
* This is a standard religious motif: for human gods from Osiris to Jesus, their own deaths (and resurrection) become the paradigm for their followers to find salvation from death.

# Scapegoating

* Since the Buddha's passing away was a matter of great concern, it is only natural to look for a scapegoat.
* When bhikkhunis were likened to a disease and flood, they become the scapegoat for the ending of Buddhism.

# Diseases as Similes

* 'White bones' (*setaṭṭhika*) and 'red rot' (*mañjiṭṭhikā*) are genuine crop diseases.
* The Indic word *mañjiṭṭhikā* means 'color of madder', a deep red dye still used today in India.

# Intriguing Similes

* While most analysts have focused on the nature of the eight *garudhammas*, for me those rules are not the issue.
* The real killer is the similes at the end, which announce the presence of the Prince of Unreason.

# Red as a Symbol

* Disease is not the property of Mahāpajāpatī alone; nor is it just here that sickness is red.
* Red is blood, the blood of violence, wounding, menses, anger; the bleeding flesh of a slain beast.




# Chapter 19 The Flood

* Flood symbolizes relentless destruction and threat to existence.
* Buddha's establishment of rules for nuns (garudhammas) compared to building a dyke against flood waters.
* Tears are associated with Mahāpajāpatī, symbolizing weakness and potential for endless births and deaths.
* Luang Ta Bua, a Thai monk, sparked controversy by publicly weeping after enlightenment, challenging traditional views on arahants.

* Mother's milk also compared to the flood of *saṁsāra*, linking it to Mahāpajāpatī as the source of life-sustaining milk.
* Buddha equates blood and mother's milk, highlighting sacrifice and interconnectedness.
* Ancient beliefs viewed mother's milk as purified blood, a concept reflected in European medical thought.

* The cyclical transformation of water through nature is described, connecting it to the divine and human body.
* Mahāpajāpatī is linked to leaking tears, milk, and implied blood, reinforcing her image as polluting.
* A story depicts Buddha instructing nuns to wash themselves due to their odor, further emphasizing Mahāpajāpatī's association with impurity.

* Historical perspectives on women's bodies as sources of contagion and danger are discussed.
* The projection of female power onto figures like witches or bhikkhunis allows men to define themselves in opposition.




# The Female Body as Leaking and Uncontainable

* The female body is often depicted as a leaking, uncontrollable liquid, lacking self-containment.
* This imagery stems from the infant's perception of its mother's body as an undifferentiated whole.
* This fear of being absorbed back into the mother persists in adulthood, manifesting in anxieties about fluids, pollution, engulfment, and drowning.

# The Witch and Magic

* Magic is associated with the denial of boundaries, blurring the lines between self and other.
* The formlessness of the female body makes her a natural magician.
* To control witches, their power must be "bottled up," symbolizing the suppression of feminine fluidity.

# The Vessel as Symbol of Feminine Power

* The vessel is a central symbol representing the woman's capacity to nurture and give life.
* Buddhist nuns use alms bowls, embodying this symbolism of abundance and sustenance.
* Damming up nuns by denying them alms disrupts their natural fertility and ability to provide for themselves.

# Water as a Symbol of Feminine Power and Danger

* Water imagery is deeply intertwined with femininity, representing both creation and destruction.
* Sarasvatī, the Hindu goddess of waters, embodies this duality, bringing life-giving rains but also potentially destructive floods.
* The serpent, associated with water and primordial chaos, represents both danger and the source of life.

# The Sky Hero and the Control of Water

* Indra, the Indian sky hero, slays the dragon Vṛtra to release the imprisoned waters.
* This myth symbolizes the male's control over feminine power, represented by the waters.
* Despite being personified as male, Vṛtra embodies feminine imagery, highlighting the underlying tension between conscious and unconscious forces.

# Chapter 20 The Serpent

* This chapter discusses the negative portrayal of women in Indian literature, particularly comparing them to snakes.
* Snakes are seen as malignant, slimy, venomous, and shape-shifting, qualities attributed to women.
* Women's "poison" is linked to their menstrual blood and gossip, which is believed to be destructive.

# The Black Snake Suttas

* These sutras depict women as dangerous and comparable to black snakes, highlighting their filthiness, stink, cowardice, treachery, aggression, grudge-holding, poisonous nature, forked tongues, and adultery.
* The author questions the authenticity of these sutras, considering them atypical of Buddha's teachings on gender.
* He argues that these passages might be intended to deter monks from sexual desires but instead evoke fear, disgust, and aversion.

# Examining the Claims

* The author analyzes each characteristic attributed to women in the Black Snake Suttas using modern psychological research.
* Studies show mixed results regarding aggression, grudge-holding, and backbiting, with little evidence supporting significant gender differences.
* Research consistently indicates that men have a higher sex drive and are more likely to engage in adultery.

# Conclusion

* The author concludes that the stereotypes presented in the Black Snake Suttas lack empirical support and contradict Buddha's usual balanced approach to gender.
* He suggests that these sutras might be later additions to the text, reflecting societal biases rather than Buddha's actual teachings.

# The Kamboja Sutta and Misogyny in Buddhist Texts

* The Kamboja Sutta displays strong misogynistic views, attributing negative traits like anger, envy, greed, and stupidity to women.
* These traits are used to justify social injustices against women, excluding them from political, judicial, business, and travel opportunities.
* This misogyny contrasts with other Pali discourses praising wise and awakened bhikkhunis and laywomen.

# Contradictions in Indian Literature

* Apparent contradictions frequently appear within the same text, as seen in the *Rāmāyaṇa*, which praises Sītā as an ideal wife while also describing women's nature as fickle and treacherous.
* This tendency towards contradiction is prevalent in Indian literature, mythology, and even logic, with examples like the four-fold scheme of propositions (A; not-A; A & not-A; neither A nor not-A).

# Diversity of Attitudes Towards Women

* Early Buddhist texts display a genuine diversity of attitudes towards women.
* Sponberg suggests this diversity arises from ambivalence within a single speaker or multivocality, with different voices expressing diverse perspectives.

# The Snake as a Symbol for Femininity

* Comparing women to black snakes reveals more about men's perceptions than women themselves.
* The snake symbolizes ambiguity and formlessness, fitting the diverse nature of femininity.

# The Serpent in Indian Culture

* The serpent holds deep significance in ancient Indian culture, appearing in Indus Valley Civilization art and later associated with *kuṇḍalinī*, the psychic energy depicted as a coiled serpent.
* Interestingly, this image appears in Buddhist texts before Hindu ones, with the *nāga* king Muñcalinda coiling around the Buddha.

# The Serpent as a Symbol of Redemption

* In Jataka tales, the serpent transforms from a symbol of poisonous death to one of redemption.
* This shift occurs during a time of crisis when the Nāgas, threatened by the Garuḍa bird, appeal for peace based on maternal love.

# Chapter 21 The Deepest Taboo

* Death is associated with menstruation as a taboo across cultures.
* Examples from Frazer's work illustrate various taboos surrounding menstruation, often involving isolation of women and belief in their ability to harm crops or people.
* These beliefs persist even today despite lacking rational basis.

# Thailand

* Many Thai temples prohibit women from circumnambulating stupas due to the belief that menstruation makes them unclean.
* This practice originates from Hinduism and is not supported by Buddhist teachings.
* Some Thai Buddhists believe menstruating women possess power that can nullify sacred mantras, leading to restrictions on their activities.

# Japan

* Popular Buddhism in Japan historically viewed women as inherently unclean due to menstruation.
* The Menstruation Sutra reinforced this belief, stating that menstrual blood pollutes the environment and offends Buddhas, leading to rebirth in hell.
* Some Buddhist scholars attempted to explain this defilement by attributing it to women's supposed negative volitions like jealousy and evil character.

# Tibet

* Ven Tenzin Palmo highlights the dominance of men in Tibetan Buddhism and restrictions placed on women due to menstruation taboos.
* These taboos, based on myths, prohibit women from holy places and ceremonies despite contradicting Buddha's teachings on gender equality and female spiritual liberation.

## Myanmar

* Women are not allowed to enter the close quarters of Buddha images at the Inle Phaung-daw Oo Pagoda.
* The author explains this restriction by saying that women are considered "the weaker sex" due to menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth.
* It is believed that if women disobey these restrictions, disasters may occur.

## Sri Lanka

* Some religious practices in Sri Lanka prohibit women from entering certain fields or performing specific rituals.
* Menstruation is considered a major impurity, and women are restricted from attending religious places or ceremonies during their period.
* Farm women must ritually purify themselves before working in the field during menstruation.

* Menstruation taboos influence the treatment of Buddhist nuns, with some people objecting to bhikkhunis due to concerns about menstrual blood soiling robes.
* While Buddhism does not consider menstruation impure, these beliefs persist in Buddhist communities.
* The association of menstruation with impurity is used as a political tool, as seen in Thailand where menstrual blood was used to neutralize magical attacks.

## Menstruation Taboos and Gender Inequality

* Menstrual taboos are rooted in patriarchal structures that privilege male spiritual authority.
* Monks and those practicing magic are believed to be vulnerable to the power of female sexuality, symbolized by menstruation.
* In some Buddhist countries, monks avoid contact with women even accidentally, using "receiving cloths" when accepting offerings.
* This practice is similar to Christian traditions where women were restricted from touching sacred objects during menstruation.

* Menstruation taboos also contribute to opposition against women's ordination in both Christianity and Buddhism.
* Despite being condemned as impurity, menstruation is also seen as a symbol of female creative power in some contexts.
* Tantric practices utilize the taboo power of menstruation for spiritual transformation.

# Chapter 22 How To Kill A Dead Nun
* Menstruation taboos are pervasive in Buddhism, influencing women's lives despite monks generally treating them kindly.
* This dichotomy stems from institutional sexism within Buddhism, which reinforces sexist tendencies without addressing the underlying fears and incomprehension about women.

* The Theravādin monastic Sangha denies the existence of bhikkhunis (female monastics), contradicting Buddhist texts and denying their right to exist.
* This denial is part of a broader indifference to women's participation in Buddhism, with dialogue dominated by male agendas and resistance to acknowledging powerful unconscious forces at play.

* The ritual denial of bhikkhunis occurs during the recitation of the disciplinary code (*pātimokkha*), where monks intone that bhikkhunis "do not exist now."
* This existential denial reflects a fear of the power of bhikkhunis, seen as a threat to Buddhism that must be eliminated.

* The control over female ordination through *garudhammas* aims to render the women's community infertile by taking away their power of procreation.
* Symbolic destruction is also employed, exemplified by the recurring stories in Vinayas about monks destroying stupas built for nuns.




## 14 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya Tells The Story Like This.

* Samā bhikkhuni died and the bhikkhunis built a stupa for her bones in the bhikkhus' monastery.
* The noise from the bhikkhunis lamenting disturbed the bhikkhus, leading Upāli to destroy the stupa.
* The bhikkhunis, enraged, attempted to attack Upāli but he escaped using psychic powers.

## 16 Since it's such a memorable moment in Buddhist history, let's have the Sarvāstivāda account.

* Kalulatissa bhikkhu died and his seven sisters, who were bhikkhunis, built a stupa for him.
* Kata bhikkhu destroyed the stupa and used it as his bed.
* Thullanandā bhikkhuni, enraged, planned to sew Kata to his bed with her sisters.

## 22 The variations in these texts are too complex to analyze in detail here, but there are some general affinities along sectarian lines.

* Vibhajjavāda schools focus on the noise from the lamentation of the bhikkhunis for a deceased senior bhikkhuni.
* Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda tell of a dead bhikkhu and the problem being the erection of a stupa.
* All these Vinayas, representing most of the Sthavira group of schools, preserve an account of bhikkhus destroying a stupa built by bhikkhunis.

## 23 The fact is there: the story exists. But the meaning is elusive—what are we to make of such tales?

* Gregory Schopen argues that a stupa was more than a memorial; it was a symbol of a deceased person, especially a religious teacher, embodying their very life.
* Destroying a stupa would amount to murder, explaining the vengeful rage of the bhikkhunis.

## 24 Frazer discusses at length the concept of an 'external soul', some physical thing that embodies a person's life.

* As long as this external 'soul' survives, the person cannot die.
* The creation of a stupa containing relics would be a fitting form for an external soul.

## 25 Schopen notices that accounts of bhikkhus' deaths are regularly accompanied by stories of their stupas, but such accounts are absent from nuns' stories.

*  Bhikkhunis do not worship the stupa of one of their own kind, but that of Ānanda.

## 26 Our stories from the Vinaya are unusual in preserving accounts of stupas built by or for nuns.

* These stupas are destroyed by monks who seemingly get away with it.
* Schopen describes such actions as 'not just ritual murder but something more akin to the political assassination of a group's special dead'.

## 27 I don't know enough about the archaeology to test Schopen's claim that there is no epigraphic evidence of nun's stupas in India. However, I have come across several references to stupas for nuns in the written sources.

* The Sri Lankan Mahāvaṁsa mentions a stupa built for Elder Nun Saṅghamittā.
* Fa-xian mentions a stupa at the spot where Uppalavaṇṇā greeted the Buddha.
* Xuan-zang also notes stupas at Mahāpajāpatī's monastery in Sāvatthī and at Vesālī commemorating the *parinirvāna* of Mahāpajāpatī and other bhikkhunis.

## 31 Though few, these references do show that stupas for nuns existed in ancient India, and played their legitimate role in religious life.




# Chapter 23 A Very Grievous Text

* This chapter explores misogynistic attitudes present in some Buddhist teachings, particularly Jātakas.
* It argues that these views are not representative of Buddhism's core principles but reflect cultural biases prevalent at the time.

# Jātakas

* Jātakas are a collection of stories featuring the Buddha in past lives, used to teach moral lessons.
* They are an important part of Buddhist tradition, passed down orally and later written down.
* While many Jātakas promote positive values, some contain misogynistic views that contradict Buddhist teachings on compassion and equality.

# Misogyny in Jātakas

* The chapter presents examples of Jātaka verses depicting women as deceitful, wicked, and sexually insatiable.
* These portrayals are criticized for perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contradicting the Buddha's message of enlightenment accessible to all beings.
* It argues that these misogynistic views were likely accepted due to pre-existing cultural biases rather than genuine Buddhist doctrine.

# The Asātamanta Jātaka

* This specific Jātaka is analyzed as an example of how misogyny is embedded in Buddhist narratives through recasting mythic motifs.
* The story involves a mother who manipulates her son into learning a "Grievous Text" that supposedly exposes the faults of women, highlighting societal pressures on men to view women negatively.

# Conclusion

* The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of critically examining traditional teachings and recognizing when they contradict core Buddhist principles.
* It encourages readers to reject harmful stereotypes and embrace the true spirit of Buddhism, which promotes compassion, equality, and understanding for all beings.

## The Asātamanta Jātaka

* A student is sent by his mother to learn the "Grievous Text" from his teacher.
* The teacher reveals there is no such text and instructs the student to serve his mother, praising her beauty and repeating everything she says.
* The old mother, believing the student loves her, asks him to kill his teacher.
* The student relays this to his teacher who, knowing his mother's impending death, stages a scene with a wooden figure to make her believe she has killed him.

## Analysis of the Asātamanta Jātaka

* The story utilizes doubled parents: natural parents and substitute parents (teacher and mother).
* This mirrors the Buddha's own life story, where his worldly parents contrast with his spiritual parents.
* The student's choice between worldly good and renunciation parallels the Buddha's choice.
* Fire worship is a key motif, symbolizing power and the connection between the physical and mystical worlds.

## Further Analysis

* The story presents a misogynistic view of women as dangerous and seductive.
* However, it also acknowledges a positive aspect of femininity through the student's natural mother who guides him towards renunciation.
* The narrative duality depicts both the destructive and creative aspects of femininity in the hero's life.
* Character identifications link the story to the Buddha's time, emphasizing the cyclical nature of events driven by karma.

## Characters and their Significance

* **The teacher:** Represents wisdom and consciousness, ultimately guiding the student towards enlightenment.
* **The student (Ānanda):** A junior monk who learns a valuable lesson about the dangers of desire.
* **The mother:** Embodies both the negative (seductive, destructive) and positive (spiritual guide) aspects of femininity.
* **Natural parents (Bhaddākāpilānī and Mahākassapa):** Represent the Buddha's own parents, highlighting the timeless nature of the story's themes.

# Chapter 24 The Hero Departs

* This chapter explores the story of Buddha and its significance in understanding the role of women.
* It emphasizes that the Buddha's story is a man's story, with women appearing in relation to him.
* The chapter highlights the importance of understanding the values and message embedded within the Buddha's story.

# The Hero Myth

* This section discusses the concept of the hero myth and its significance in shaping culture and identity.
* It explains that heroes embody a unique destiny and possess superhuman qualities, standing out from ordinary individuals.
* The chapter argues that the hero's "specialness" stems from their identification with the individual's subjective experience as the center of the universe.

# Campbell's Hero Journey

* This part introduces Joseph Campbell's analysis of the hero myth, which outlines a three-stage structure: Departure, Initiation, and Return.
* It acknowledges the limitations of Campbell's approach, noting that it focuses on the journey itself and may not fully capture the entirety of the hero's life story.

# The Buddha's Story

* This section emphasizes the importance of examining early scriptures to understand the formation of the Buddha's life story.
* It introduces Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi's *The Life of the Buddha* as a primary source for exploring the Buddha's journey.
* The chapter outlines the plan to analyze the Buddha's life through the lens of Campbell's stages, while also considering elements from later retellings and alternative sources.

# Gender and the Hero Myth

* This part addresses the gender bias inherent in the hero myth as analyzed by Campbell.
* It acknowledges that the Buddha's story is told from a masculine perspective and reflects patriarchal values.
* The chapter introduces alternative "feminine" myths, such as "Bluebeard" or "Beauty and the Beast," which emphasize relationships and completion rather than individual quests.

# Etymology of "Hero"

* This section explores the etymology of the word "hero," suggesting a possible connection to the ancient Greek goddess Hera.
* It proposes that the hero was originally the divine consort of the goddess, symbolizing ripeness for marriage and seasonal renewal.
* The chapter raises the question of whether consciousness itself might be considered a masculine symbol due to its association with stereotypically masculine qualities.

# Miraculous Birth
* The Buddha's birth is described as miraculous and aligns with the "virgin mother" archetype in hero narratives.
* It involves divine intervention, celestial signs, and a sense of otherworldly significance.
* The birth occurs outside the traditional home, symbolizing a departure from ordinary existence.

# Prophecy
* The prophecy of the Buddha's Awakening is delivered by the sage Asita, who foresees Siddhattha's future greatness.
* This prophecy highlights the predetermined nature of the Buddha's path, contrasting with his later emphasis on personal choice and effort.
* The story's inclusion in later texts reflects the tendency for myths to emphasize inevitability and destiny.

# Marvelous Childhood
* The Buddha's upbringing is characterized by luxury and privilege, contrasting sharply with his later ascetic life.
* His spontaneous attainment of jhana while under a roseapple tree signifies his innate spiritual potential and independence.
* These details, though limited, conform to the "wonderful childhood" archetype, hinting at Siddhattha's extraordinary destiny as a meditator and spiritual explorer. 




## Departure 1. The Call To Adventure
* A chance event reveals a new world, drawing the individual towards unfamiliar forces.
* This encounter triggers a shift in the individual's center of gravity from their societal norms to an unknown realm.
* The Attadaṇḍa Sutta presents a realistic account of the call, where it stems from witnessing universal conflict and violence, leading to a desire for peace and stability.

## 2. Refusal Of The Call
* Sometimes individuals ignore the call to adventure due to fear or attachment to familiar comforts.
* While not explicitly mentioned in Siddhattha's canonical story, the Mahāpadāna Sutta depicts Bodhisatta Vipassī hesitating before embracing his destiny.
* Later retellings incorporated this hesitation into Siddhattha's narrative. 




## 3. Supernatural Aid

* The hero receives aid from a protective figure who provides amulets against challenges.
* This stage represents the inner assurance of hidden abilities that the hero can access during crises.
* In later texts, this aid is elaborated through divine interventions like gods helping the Bodhisatta escape.


##  The Disgust Scene

* The scene depicts women in a harem sleeping in various dishevelled and unattractive poses.
* This imagery is intended to evoke disgust in the hero (and the reader) towards worldly pleasures.
* The scene is orchestrated by deities to highlight the illusory nature of beauty and desire.
* The poet plays with contrasting emotions, initially arousing the reader before shifting to revulsion.
* The same scene can be interpreted differently depending on the observer's perspective.

##  Comparison with Ramayana

* The Ramayana presents a similar scene but with a more positive view of the women.
* In the Buddhist story, the dancing girls are ultimately messengers from the gods, pushing the hero towards enlightenment.
* While seemingly negative, the disgust scene in the Buddhist narrative serves a crucial purpose in the hero's journey.

## 4. The Crossing Of The First Threshold

* The hero encounters a 'threshold guardian' at the entrance to a zone of magnified power, representing the limits of his current sphere.
* This threshold is represented by the Buddha's family, who experience emotional conflict and suffering when he leaves.
* Siddhattha abandons his wife and child, highlighting the irreconcilable contradiction between worldly values and those of a renunciate.

## 5. The Belly Of The Whale

* The hero is swallowed into the unknown and appears to die, symbolizing a death to his former life.
* The Bodhisatta adopts symbols of the outsider, such as shaved head and ascetic robes, signifying a break from conventional society.
* This stage involves severe ascetic practices, which are later rationalized by Buddhist traditions but serve as a badge of authenticity for the Buddha.

## Chapter 25 The Hero Wakes

* Campbell calls this stage 'initiation', marking the climax of the heroic quest and representing Awakening in Buddhist terms.

## 6. The Road Of Trials

* After crossing the threshold, the hero faces a succession of trials in a dreamlike landscape.
* The Bodhisatta studies with mystics but ultimately leaves them behind to transcend all forms of rebirth.
* He endures years of physical torment and confronts Māra, representing psychological challenges and temptations.

## 7. The Meeting With The Goddess

* The ultimate adventure in mythology often involves a hero-soul uniting with the Queen Goddess of the World. This symbolizes achieving knowledge and overcoming obstacles.
* Woman represents all that can be known, while the hero seeks to know.
* The goddess is depicted literally in later legends, such as the earth-goddess appearing beneath Buddha during his awakening.

* She symbolizes fate, destiny, and cyclical events.
*  The goddess's association with water imagery connects her to fertility and nourishment.
* Sujātā, who offers rice milk to the Buddha, represents a more homely counterpart to the earth-goddess.

* This story emphasizes fertility motifs through the offering of grain and milk.
* Sujātā's longing for the Buddha highlights the tension between spiritual pursuit and earthly desires.
* Accepting the milk-rice signifies accepting both body and mind, leading to the rejection by ascetically-minded companions.


## 8. Woman As The Temptress

*  The text explores the discomfort some feel towards acknowledging the primal nature of life, often symbolized by woman.
* In Buddhism, the tempter is often a woman, although men can also fulfill this role.
* The Sutta Nipāta depicts Māra's daughters (Craving, Lust, and Desire) attempting to tempt the Buddha.

* This portrays a negative depiction of the feminine as undermining ascetic fervor.
*  The story creates a gender balance between good and bad women, mirroring the opposition between Māra and Brahmā.
* The Buddha transcends gender, while Brahmā represents the positive male archetype.

## 9. Atonement With The Father

* Atonement involves abandoning the ego's self-created illusions of a punishing God and sinful desires.
* This requires faith in the father's mercy and reliance on that mercy.
* The Buddha's conversion of his father, Suddhodana, exemplifies this perfect atonement.
* Suddhodana also achieves atonement with Brahmā, the World-Father, symbolizing forgiveness and compassion.

## 10. Apotheosis

* The Buddha transcends ego and experiences the emptiness on which all phenomena arise.
* He feels compassion for beings trapped in their own delusions.
* His apotheosis involves dissolving the boundaries between himself and the world.
* This realization of "deathlessness" is accessible to all through human potential.
* Dreams predict the Buddha's Awakening and its universal impact, foreshadowing his role as a world-liberator.

## 11. The Ultimate Boon

* Spiritual growth involves overcoming personal limitations, symbolized by conquering dragons.
* This leads to a realization transcending all forms and experiences, including divinities.
* The Buddha's wisdom is depicted as radiant and sun-like, repelling negativity.
* The dragon Muñcalinda symbolizes protection and the embrace of the complete cosmic cycle.
* Transcendence is represented by the spread hood of the dragon, signifying freedom from the ego's "I am" concept. 




# Chapter 26 The Hero Returns
* The return phase focuses on sharing the Buddha's Awakening with the community.
* Early depictions of the Buddha's life emphasize his connection with people.

# The Return 12. Refusal Of The Return
* After achieving enlightenment, the hero may hesitate to return to the ordinary world.
* The Buddha initially considered remaining in meditative bliss but was persuaded by Brahmā Sahampati to teach others.

# 13. The Magic Flight
* This stage involves a pursuit of the hero by opposing forces.
* While not explicitly depicted as a flight, Māra repeatedly attempts to hinder the Buddha's return and teaching.

# 16. The Buddha's Statement on Bhikkhunis
* The Buddha declares he won't pass away until the bhikkhuni order is established.
* This contradicts the narrative of his reluctance to establish a nuns' order, highlighting textual ambiguity.

## 14. Rescue From Without

* The hero may need help returning from their supernatural adventure.
* This assistance can come from various sources, such as divine intervention or pleas from loved ones.
* The hero must re-enter the ordinary world with their newfound wisdom and face resistance from those who don't understand.

## 15. The Crossing Of The Return Threshold

* The realms of the divine and human are distinct but interconnected.
* The hero's journey involves exploring this connection and bringing back wisdom to the mundane world.
* There is often a dissonance between the transcendent experience and everyday life, which the hero must navigate.
* The Buddha's initial reluctance to teach and the challenges he faced in convincing others highlight this difficulty.

## 16. Master Of The Two Worlds

* A master can move freely between the realms of the ordinary and the extraordinary without being contaminated by either.
* They embody a state of "anonymity," surrendering to the flow of life and allowing the Law (Dhamma) to guide them.
* The Buddha's mastery is demonstrated through his interactions with both human and divine beings, showcasing his transcendence of worldly limitations.

## 17. Freedom To Live


* The hero, empowered by their insights, lives with calmness and freedom, regardless of their role in society.
* The Buddha exemplifies this by teaching and serving others, inspiring them to embark on their own journeys of awakening.
* He encourages his followers to spread the Dhamma, creating a ripple effect of enlightenment that continues beyond his lifetime.

## The Return Continues

* Campbell's seventeen stages mark the end of his framework but the beginning of Buddha's journey, which faces numerous challenges.
* Khandhaka narrative addresses these difficulties, including disputes like Devadatta's betrayal and the Kosambi episode where the Sangha split over a trivial matter.
* The story of Mahāpajāpatī is presented within this context of threats to the 'return'.

## The Mythologizing Process

* Buddha's life story reflects the ancient hero archetype, with parallels evident even in early texts.
* This mythologization process runs counter to the flow of time, becoming more elaborate as Indian culture grew more rational and skeptical.
*  Later elaborations on Buddha's myth can be seen as a response to this secularizing trend, clinging to improbable miracles.

## The Later Developments

* Later developments in Buddha's myth incorporate numerous hero myth motifs, sometimes trivializing the narrative rather than enhancing it.
* Examples include the Bodhisattva winning his bride through various contests and being born from his mother's side.
* These elements are often directly copied from other myths, leading many modernists to dismiss Buddhist myth altogether.

## Symbolism and Folk Tales

* Buddhist traditions blur the line between primitive folk tales and sophisticated symbolism within their myths.
* Some myths clearly represent symbolic truths, while others depict deities achieving awakening through simple morality tales.
* This mixing of different types of mythologizing exemplifies Ken Wilber's 'pre/trans fallacy'. 




# Chapter 27 Building The Legend

* This chapter explores how the myth of the Buddha was constructed.
* Early Buddhist texts contain scattered episodes from the Buddha's life, reflecting an unconscious archetypal understanding of him.
* Over time, these episodes were arranged into a coherent narrative biography, marking a shift towards a conscious understanding of the Buddha as an archetypal figure.

# The Sources of the Buddha's Life Story

* Three main types of early canonical sources provide information about the Buddha's life:
    * Prose discourses attributed to the Buddha himself.
    * Prose narratives in the third person, telling stories from the Buddha's life.
    * Verse episodes found mainly in the Sutta Nipāta.

# The Unification of Texts through Narrative

* Although there is no single chronological account of the Buddha's life in early texts, each text is embedded within the story of the Buddha through a formula stating where he was staying at the time.
* This literary device unifies the texts and imbues them with the authority of the Buddha.

# The Development of the Buddha Epic

* Ānanda, the Buddha's attendant for twenty years, played a key role in developing the Buddha's biography.
* The Khandhakas, found in all Vinaya traditions, represent the first attempt to frame the Buddha's teaching as a heroic story.
* This narrative framework encloses the monastic rules and presents them as arising from events in the Buddha's life.

# The Entire Canon as an Extended Hero Epic

* Each Sutta and Vinaya rule begins by stating where the Buddha was staying, suggesting that each passage is presented as an episode in his life.
* This implies that the entire canon can be seen as an extended hero epic.

# Parallelism and the Unconscious Narrative

* The presence of parallel elements in separate narratives suggests that an unconscious understanding of the Buddha's life story existed before it was explicitly organized.




# The Khandhaka narrative

* Tells the story of the Buddha's life from his Awakening to the Second Council.
* Starts with the Buddha's hesitation to teach, his first teaching, conversion of disciples, and ordination of Sariputta and Moggallāna.
* Then shifts to legalistic concerns like ordination procedures.
* Includes mythic aspects like the rebellion of Devadatta.
* Ends with the story of the bhikkhunis and the Buddha's passing away.

# The Political Dimension of the Hero Myth

* The story of women's ordination appears as an episode in a hero myth, constructed by those who benefited from it.
* This myth serves a political purpose, justifying the authority of the victorious party at the Second Council (the Pāveyyakas).

# Ānanda and the Textual Changes

* Ānanda is portrayed both as the Buddha's closest disciple and in conflict with Mahākassapa.
* Episodes critical of Ānanda could be actual events, expressions of his guilt, or attempts to denigrate him by opposing parties.
* The text was likely redacted after Ānanda's death, during the period leading up to the Second Council.

# The Second Council and Textual Transmission

* The Second Council marked the end-point of the Vinayas.
* It is unlikely that the redactors left no marks on the texts; they were human and influenced by their own perspectives.

# Narrative Structure and Authority

* The Vinaya uses narrative to give emotional context to rules.
* Each rule is prefaced by a story about its origin, linked to the Buddha's life story.
* This imbues the rules with authority, even though much of the Vinaya post-dates the Buddha.

# Shifting Focus in the Narratives

* The Second Council account is realistic and journalistic.
* The Mahāparinibbāna/First Council narrative is more mythic.
* The Catuṣpariṣat Sutra is less realistic, and birth narratives are purely mythic.
* This reflects the narrator's proximity to events and the influence of memory and embellishment.

# Different Voices in the Texts

* Journalistic elements allow for historical analysis.
* Mythic elements provide insights into the unconscious dynamics of the Buddhist community.
* The Buddha's own accounts are more direct and less influenced by later interpretations.

# Chapter 28 The Wicked Stepmother

* This chapter explores the duality of motherhood represented by Māyā and Mahāpajāpatī in Buddhist tradition.
* While Māyā is idealized as the pure, virginal mother, Mahāpajāpatī embodies the reality of nurturing and daily care.
* Despite her essential role in Siddhattha's upbringing, she is often portrayed as a "wicked stepmother" figure, reflecting a common trope in fairytales and mythology.

# The Wicked Stepmother Archetype

* The archetype of the wicked stepmother serves to trivialize complex themes related to motherhood and female power.
* Examples from Greek and Roman literature illustrate the prevalence of this negative portrayal, often associating stepmothers with evil intentions and destructive behavior.
* Interestingly, while the stereotype persists, empirical evidence suggests that biological fathers pose a greater risk to children than stepfathers.

# Mahāpajāpatī: Beyond the Stereotype

* The name "Mahāpajāpatī" suggests her connection to creation and progeny, highlighting her role as a mother figure.
* Her existence in Buddhist consciousness is directly tied to her son Siddhattha's journey to becoming Buddha.
* Despite initial ambiguity surrounding her ordination, later traditions portray Mahāpajāpatī achieving enlightenment and attaining Nibbana in a grand and miraculous manner.

# A Hagiographic Account

* The Therī-Apadāna presents a highly idealized account of Mahāpajāpatī's life and death, emphasizing her spiritual achievements and supernatural abilities.
* This hagiography may be seen as an attempt to counter the negative stereotype of the wicked stepmother and promote a positive image of women's spirituality within Buddhism.

# Questions and Interpretations

* The author questions whether the extravagance of Mahāpajāpatī's miracles might indicate an effort to compensate for a potentially darker reality surrounding her story.
* This raises interesting questions about the role of hagiography in shaping religious narratives and the complexities of representing female figures within patriarchal structures.

## Mahāpajāpatī's Rare Jātaka Appearances


* Despite her pivotal role in Buddhist history, Mahāpajāpatī is mentioned in only two Jātakas.

* These Jātakas are ignored in the Apadāna and the commentary, as if the tradition is preserving two quite different, isolated attitudes towards Mahāpajāpatī.
* On the conscious level she is celebrated as the founder of the great spiritual order of bhikkhunis, as well as being a great Awakened being in her own right.

* Unconsciously, perhaps, she still poses the threat of destroying Buddhism.


## The Culladhammapāla Jātaka

* This Jātaka concerns the evil deeds of King Mahāpatāpa (Great Fall) of Benares.
* When his son Dhammapāla was seven months old, his mother, Queen Candā (Moon), bathed him and played with him, failing to rise when the king entered.

* Incensed by her disrespect, the king ordered the executioner to cut off the boy's hands, feet, and head.
* The queen offered herself in place of her son but was ignored.
* The Buddha revealed that the king was Devadatta; Queen Candā was Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī; and he himself was Prince Dhammapāla.

* This disturbing story reveals a conflict between father and son for the affections of the mother.

* The actions of the king are scarcely to be accounted for by the mild provocation, revealing an ancient archetype of jealous gods.
* Mahāpajāpatī's reluctance to pay formal respect mirrors her desire not to bow to the monks in 'this' life.

* Her motherliness is presented as an ideal of ethical virtue, but the imagistic associations reveal the primitive roots of the myth.


## The Cūḷanandiya Jātaka

* This Jātaka deals with the difficulties faced by a group of monkeys when confronted by a fierce hunter.
* Big Nandiya and his brother Little Nandiya lived in the Himalayas overseeing a company of 80,000 monkeys. They looked after their blind old mother, seeking out the sweetest fruit for her.

* The brothers abandoned their great company to look after their mother together.
* They took their mother from the mountains down into the wilderness, where they set up home in a banyan tree.

* A hunter, who was a graduate of the Brahmanical studies at Takkasilā, lived in that region and slaughtered many animals for meat.





# The Hunter and the Monkeys

* A hunter was about to shoot a decrepit old monkey when her sons intervened, offering their lives in her stead.
* The hunter killed all three monkeys.
* As punishment for his cruelty, lightning struck his home, killing his wife and children.

# The Jataka Story's Deeper Meaning

* This story teaches conventional Buddhist values like non-harming and the consequences of karma.
* However, it also reveals primitive elements such as omenology (belief in omens) and a focus on vicarious atonement.

# Omenology and Karma

* Omenology is evident in the brahman teacher's warning to his student based on inauspicious marks, foreshadowing the hunter's fate.
* The story presents a somewhat incoherent view of karma, with the hunter's family suffering for his actions despite the Buddhist principle of individual responsibility.

# Gender Roles and Suffering

* The story revolves around the passive female figures (the monkey mother and Devadatta's wife) who are dependent on the male characters.
* The male character is the agent of violence, representing the destructive force of the world.
* This highlights the existential dimension of suffering, where death is inevitable regardless of individual choices.

# Mahāpajāpatī and Devadatta

* The connection between Mahāpajāpatī (the Buddha's aunt) and Devadatta (his cousin who tried to kill him) is significant.
* Both Jataka stories featuring Mahāpajāpatī depict her sons suffering violent deaths due to Devadatta's actions.

# Mahāpajāpatī's Image in the Bhikkhuni Ordination Story

* The story of Mahāpajāpatī seeking bhikkhuni ordination portrays her as emotional, unclean, and disruptive to the Sangha's order.
* Her appearance challenges the ideal image of a renunciate and represents a threat to the Buddha's authority.

# Power Dynamics and Spiritual Authority

* The Buddha's refusal to ordain Mahāpajāpatī establishes his power and independence.
* This echoes mythological themes where defying powerful female figures leads to destruction.




# 71 Hippolytus and the Great Mother

* Hippolytus represents a stage of resistance to the Great Mother archetype.
* His rejection of her advances symbolizes a desire for autonomy and independence.
* This "chastity" signifies a move towards a higher, more conscious masculinity.

# 72 The Sangha's Independence

* The Buddha has already overcome this crisis, but the male Sangha needs to maintain its independence.
* Strict control measures are necessary to ensure this separation.

# 73 Rebellion and Differentiation

* The myth of the son rebelling against his mother represents the differentiation of consciousness from the unconscious.
* This process is ongoing and not a new creation.
* Individuals develop a core sense of self even while imitating their mothers.

# 74 Youth Gangs and Men's Clubs

* Young people seek strength in numbers after separating from the mother figure.
* This leads to the formation of youth gangs, which later evolve into Men's Clubs.
* These clubs reinforce the distinction from the mother and serve as a basis for social institutions.

# 75 Origins of Men's Clubs

* According to Neumann, Men's Clubs originated from networks within tribes or clans.
* Members are relatively equal within groups, but there is a hierarchy between age groups.
* Initiation rituals mark the transition between these groups and often involve hardship.

# 76 Containment of Conflict

* Men's Clubs act as a safety valve for intergenerational conflict.
* Ritual regicide formalizes this conflict and redirects it from personal combat to symbolic expression.
* Through initiation, youth enter the circle of men and escape the limitations of the mother figure.

# 77 Entering the Men's Club

* Joining a Men's Club allows young men to develop their mature nature.
* They become conscious of themselves as responsible agents capable of making choices.
* Initiation rituals grant secret knowledge and symbolize the attainment of self-awareness.

# 78 The Sangha as a Men's Club

* Neumann's analysis applies to the Sangha, which provides support for monks seeking their identity outside societal expectations.
* Men resist women entering their clubs, leading to the establishment of separate bhikkhuni Sangha.




# Chapter 29 The Princess & The Dragon

* This chapter begins by introducing the concept of "Higher" and "Lower" aspects of masculinity and femininity, drawing on Neumann's work.
* It uses the Buddha's life story as an example, highlighting his encounters with both the animalistic (Lower Feminine) and supportive (Higher Feminine) aspects of femininity.

# The Distinction Between Higher and Lower

* The terms "higher" and "lower" are metaphorical representations of stages in psychological or spiritual development.
* They do not imply moral judgments ("good" vs. "bad").
* What is considered "lower" should be let go of, while the "higher" should be developed. This process is ongoing throughout life.

# The Metaphorical Grounding

* These metaphors are rooted in our physical experiences as biological beings.
* However, biology does not dictate spirituality; these concepts are tools for understanding psychological processes.

# Jungian Interpretations and Mythology

* Psychologists like Neumann use vivid language ("Devouring Mother," "Terrible Father") to describe these stages.
* This imagery originates from myths, particularly Greek mythology.
* These depictions should not be interpreted literally as perversions; they represent the challenges and tragedies of growing up.

# The Higher and Lower Feminine in Buddhist Narratives

* Examples of the Higher and Lower Feminine are found throughout Buddhist stories: Māyā vs. Mahāpajāpatī, parents in Jātaka tales, Hārītī's transformation, Queen Candādevī, Kaṭṭhahāri, Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā's journey, etc.

# The Princess and the Dragon Archetype

* The story of rescuing a princess from a dragon illustrates the Higher Feminine emerging from the more primal archetype of the mother.
* The "dragon" symbolizes the primordial Waters (womb), representing the universal, genderless experience of gestation.
* While the dragon may appear male in surface narratives, its underlying archetype is feminine, containing both positive and negative possibilities.

# Perseus and Andromeda: A Case Study

* This Greek myth exemplifies the Higher Feminine being saved from the clutches of the Dragon (representing the primal feminine).
* The story unfolds with Acrisius' attempt to prevent his daughter Danaë from having a son, Zeus' intervention, Perseus' birth, and their exile.

# Perseus' Quest

* Polydectes, king of Seriphos, desires Danaë and sends Perseus on a dangerous quest: to slay Medusa, whose gaze turns people to stone.
* With help from Hermes and Athena, Perseus obtains magical tools from the Grey Ladies and Nymphs.

# Confronting Medusa

* Perseus finds Medusa sleeping with her Gorgon sisters. Using his reflection in a bronze shield, he beheads Medusa, releasing Pegasus and Chrysaor.

# Rescuing Andromeda

* Arriving in Ethiopia, Perseus encounters Andromeda chained to a rock as a sacrifice to the sea monster Cetos.
* He slays the monster and rescues Andromeda, promising marriage.

# Triumph and Conspiracies

* Celebrations ensue, but Phineus, Andromeda's previous suitor, plots against Perseus.
* Perseus thwarts the plot and returns to Seriphos with Andromeda.

# The Fate of Polydectes

* Perseus finds his mother Danaë seeking refuge from Polydectes.
* He confronts Polydectes and uses Medusa's head to turn him and his friends to stone.
* Perseus makes Dictys king, returns the magical items, and gives Medusa's head to Athena.

## The Myth of Perseus

*  The story begins with a prophecy that Acrisius will die at the hands of his daughter's son, leading him to flee Argos in fear. Despite this, he encounters Perseus and is accidentally killed by a discus thrown by Perseus, fulfilling the prophecy. 

* This myth explores archetypal themes like inevitability of death, the struggle against fate, and the cyclical nature of life and death.

* Acrisius' attempt to subvert the prophecy highlights the tension between individual will and destiny. His actions also symbolize the fear of change and the desire to cling to power.
* Perseus' journey is not only his own but also his mother Danaë's quest for liberation from the control of Polydectes, who represents the "Lower Masculine."

* The story emphasizes the importance of both masculine and feminine archetypes in achieving wholeness. 

* Perseus receives help from divine figures like Hermes and Athena, representing guidance and wisdom. His encounters with various female characters highlight the importance of the anima archetype in his development.
* Medusa, a monstrous serpent goddess, symbolizes the primal feminine and the dangers of unchecked power. Her defeat by Perseus represents the taming of the unconscious and the integration of shadow aspects.

* The birth of Pegasus and Chrysaor from Medusa's body signifies the emergence of higher consciousness and heroism from the confrontation with the lower feminine.
*  Perseus' final challenge is to rescue Andromeda, representing the human anima, from Ceto, the mother of the Gorgons. This symbolizes the union of masculine and feminine energies.

## Parallels with the Ghata Jātaka

* The story of Perseus finds parallels in the Buddhist tale of Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) and his brothers.
* Both stories feature prophecies about the destruction of a lineage, leading to attempts to control or eliminate those who threaten the established order. 
*  Both narratives involve discus-throwing heroes who ultimately triumph over their enemies, but also face tragic fates due to unforeseen circumstances.

* The recurring motif of the discus symbolizes both creation and destruction, highlighting the cyclical nature of life and death.




# The Hero's Journey and the Anima

* Perseus accomplishes tasks with the help of anima figures throughout his journey.
* The oldest image depicts Perseus, Andromeda, and Medusa in a pose signifying the hero's strength through the feminine.
* Later images show Andromeda as passive and chained, highlighting the shift in perspective and the emphasis on Perseus' masculinity.

# The Anima: A Dual Nature

* The female appears twice: as the monstrous Dragon of the Deep and as the wakening woman (Andromeda).
* This process symbolizes the freeing of the anima from the power of the dragon, allowing for conscious integration within the hero's psyche.

# Dangers and Benefits of the Anima

* While essential for healthy development, the anima has dangerous aspects that must be understood by the hero.
* The anima is a complex figure with magical, alluring, and potentially destructive qualities.
* She represents both wisdom and madness, bridging the gap between the conscious and unconscious.

# Integrating the Feminine

* Perseus' victory over Medusa symbolizes incorporating the destructive aspect of the Old Mother while preserving his connection to her.
* This integration allows for a mature relationship with the feminine, exemplified by figures like Sujātā and the Earth goddess in Buddhist mythology.

# Higher Femininity vs. Lower Sexuality

* The Higher Feminine is not sexual; it represents support, companionship, and guidance towards spiritual growth.
* Examples include Medea, Ariadne, Athena, Artemis, Leia, Galadriel, Hermione, and Sītā.
* Lower sexuality belongs to earlier stages of development and can lead to an unhealthy attachment to the Great Mother archetype.

# Consequences of Unintegrated Femininity

* Failing to liberate the captive (anima) results in a continued dominance of the Great Mother's destructive aspect.
* This leads to alienation from life, hatred of the body, and world negation.
* The hero must differentiate himself from his mother and the unconscious to achieve a healthy sense of self.




# Chapter 30 The Sacred Stepmother

* This chapter revisits the story of Mahāpajāpatī's ordination with a new perspective.
* It argues that traditional interpretations focus on the Buddha's reluctance to ordain women, but the Pali Vinaya offers a more nuanced view.

# Traditional Interpretations

* Focus on the Buddha's resistance to ordaining women, portraying it as a threat to Buddhism.

# The Pali Vinaya Account

* Presents Mahāpajāpatī's request for ordination not as a destructive force but as a series of realistic snapshots of a practitioner facing challenges and overcoming them.
* Highlights her struggles and limitations while emphasizing her dedication to the Dhamma.

# Archetypal Analysis

* Suggests that the story is best understood through an archetypal lens, with characters representing different stages of spiritual development.
* Identifies the Buddha as the Higher Masculine, Mahāpajāpatī as the Lower Feminine, Ānanda as the Lower Masculine, and the other bhikkhunis as the Higher Femininity.

# The Meaning of the Garudhammas

* Interprets the eight *garudhammas*, conditions imposed on bhikkhunis, as a means to contain the "Devouring Flood" of the unconscious represented by Mahāpajāpatī's attachment.
* Views the Buddha's acceptance of Mahāpajāpatī with these conditions as a symbolic victory over the primal mother archetype.

# Mahāpajāpatī's Subsequent Requests

* Analyzes Mahāpajāpatī's later requests to the Buddha, seeing them as steps in her spiritual growth.
* Her initial request to abolish bowing to monks is interpreted as a sign of her ongoing struggle with defilements.
* Her subsequent question about Vinaya reflects a desire for harmonious integration between masculine and feminine principles within the Sangha.

# Mahāpajāpatī's Spiritual Development

* This section discusses Mahāpajāpatī's spiritual readiness to become a nun.

# Chapter 31 Rescuing The Hero

* This chapter focuses on rescuing the masculine archetype from negative stereotypes.
* It argues that for true balance, both the Higher Feminine and Higher Masculine need to be redeemed.
* Patriarchy is defined as a hierarchy ruled by fathers, separating men from women and children.

#  Rescuing the Hero: The Buddhist Context

* This section explores how Buddhism, despite its principles of equality, can still exhibit patriarchal tendencies through its monastic structure.
* It discusses the process of transforming masculinity, which involves differentiating from lower stages and integrating with the Higher Feminine.
* The dangers of this process are highlighted, including recklessness, nihilism, and misogyny.

# Rescuing the Hero: The Role of the Father

* It argues that the initial tensions within the Buddhist community after the Buddha's death can be understood as a natural part of masculine development.
* The eventual resolution of these tensions is seen as a sign of healthy integration and respect between different expressions of masculinity.

# The Energetic Transformation of Ordination

* Letting go of the Lower Feminine liberates tremendous energy for monks, empowering masculine character development and the emergence of the Higher Feminine.
* This energy can be harnessed for spiritual growth, but if not managed properly, it can lead to addiction or ego inflation.

# The Process of Spiritual Transformation

* Restraining desire for objects allows psychic energy to be directed towards higher pursuits like work ethic, family, or spirituality.
* Energetic transformation always leaves some residue behind in the unconscious, like ashes from a burnt log.
* Monastic life involves a drastic redirection of psychic energies through celibacy and other vows, leading to a powerful surge of enthusiasm and dedication.

# The Relationship with the Feminine

* A man's experience of the feminine is shaped by his internal image (anima) and external relationships with women.
* Ordination often involves withdrawing from intimate relationships, redirecting energy towards spiritual practices and "loving all sentient beings."
* This transformation can lead to a magnification of the ego, as monks are seen as heroes of consciousness and their former lives are renounced.

# The Shadow Side of Monastic Life

* The lack of meaningful relationships with women can hinder a monk's ability to empathize and understand them, leading to unhealthy projections and attitudes.
* Unresolved issues with the feminine can become internalized as a magnified shadow self, hidden in the unconscious.
* This dissociation can masquerade as disidentification, preventing genuine letting go and leading to potential problems when triggered by external stimuli.

# The Projection of the Feminine

* The projection of the feminine is shaped by symbols and images that characterize it.
* A basic image is the vessel, seen in the Holy Grail and the witch's cauldron.
* This projection stems from the idealization of Mary and a disconnect with real women, leading to the demonization of women as witches.

# The Witch as Projection

* The "bad woman" is projected as a repulsive witch rather than an enticing whore.
* The witch represents a spiritual authority that competes with men's, possessing healing and salvation powers.

# Letting Go of the Hero

* Young monks must differentiate themselves from the Lower Feminine and liberate energies tied to sex.
* In maturity, one must "let go of the hero" and renounce youthful achievements for a fruitful old age.

# The Importance of the Anima

* Permanent loss of the anima in later life leads to rigidity, crustiness, and other negative traits.

# The Sun Analogy

* Jung compares life's development to the sun rising and setting.
* In youth, consciousness ascends towards zenith; in maturity, it descends towards twilight.
* The twilight of maturity is peaceful and reflective, unlike the hopeful dawn of youth.

# Neurosis and Maturity

* Unlike Freud, Jung saw neurosis as often stemming from adult actions rather than childhood experiences.
* One cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of morning; what was once true may become a lie.

# Acceptance in Later Life

* Aging brings acceptance of bodily decline and impermanence.
* The focus shifts from defining masculinity to incorporating the Higher Feminine more deeply.

# Assimilation of Contrasexual Tendencies

* In youth, identifying with the opposite gender is regression; in maturity, it's necessary for libido progression.

# Mature Decision-Making

* Monks learn to make mature decisions, compromise, and listen—qualities associated with the Higher Feminine.

# Stages of Life in Buddhism

* The Buddha's rapid enlightenment may not reflect the slower path of most people.
* Jataka tales often depict spiritual progress through life stages: student/warrior, teacher/leader, sage.

# Chapter 32 The Hard Twin

* Buddhist shrines often depict pairs of monks: Sāriputta and Moggallāna in the Theravāda tradition, and Mahākassapa and Ānanda in northern traditions.
* These pairs represent different archetypal expressions of the 'perfect monk'. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are indistinguishable, symbolizing harmonious complementarity.
* Mahākassapa and Ānanda are distinct, reflecting conflict and disintegration arising from differentiation.

# The Conflict of Twins

* The motif of hostile twin brothers is linked to the Great Mother archetype and symbolizes the male's self-consciousness dividing into opposing elements.
* This stage represents the separation of conscious ego from the unconscious, but the ego is not yet stable enough for further separation.

# Different Traditions, Different Symbols

* The choice of monk pairs in Buddhist shrines reflects different attitudes towards time.
* Theravādins focus on the pristine origin symbolized by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
* Northern traditions emphasize lineage and continuity represented by Mahākassapa and Ānanda.

# From History to Legend

* Mahākassapa and Ānanda are transitioning from historical figures to legendary archetypes representing wings within the Sangha.
* Their differences are used to symbolize sectarian polarization, reflecting ongoing debates on disciplinary matters.

# The Playful Nature of Buddhist Texts

* Mahāyāna sutras like the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa use characters in a playful way to convey philosophical points.
* Sāriputta is depicted as a literal-minded chauvinist, highlighting the illusory nature of gender through a dialogue with a goddess/Bodhisattva disguised as a maid.

# The Illusion of Reality

* The text emphasizes that all things are impermanent and lack inherent existence (*svabhāva*).
* 'Sāriputta' in this context represents the Abhidhamma scholasticism, which clings to the idea of inherent reality.

# Beyond Literal Interpretations

* We should avoid falling into the trap of literal interpretations when encountering Buddhist stories and characters.
* Mahākassapa, like other figures, is a character informed by both his archetype and historical presence.

# The Mythic Resonance of Kassapa

* The name Kassapa carries mythic weight in Indic culture, associated with ancient sages and primordial masculinity.
* Kassapa's birth story connects him to themes of pure consciousness and divine lineage.

# Kassapa and Fire

* The name Kassapa is associated with fire in Vedic mythology and Buddhist narratives.
* The Buddha converted 1000 fire-worshipping ascetics led by three Kassapa brothers through miracles involving fire.
* This event highlights the Buddha's mastery over fire, both literally and metaphorically, representing his control over greed, hatred, and delusion.

# Mahākassapa and the Transmission of Power

* Mahākassapa plays a crucial role in preserving the Buddha's teachings after his death.
* He is depicted as receiving a direct transmission of power from the Buddha through physical contact at the cremation ceremony.
* This transmission, symbolized by fire, establishes Mahākassapa as the head of the lineage of Buddhist elders.

# Parallels with Christianity

* The transmission of spiritual authority in Buddhism mirrors the Catholic Church's concept of apostolic succession.
* Both traditions emphasize a physical and pre-moral transmission of power from the founder to his disciples.
* This transmission is seen in the ordination rituals of both religions, which involve physical gestures and words reminiscent of the founder's actions.

# Magic and Ordination

* The Buddhist ordination ceremony, while not inherently magical, borrows elements from magic rituals, such as connective and imitative magic.
* These elements create an emotional resonance and a sense of sanctity surrounding the process.
* However, the emphasis on rational aspects like suitability, mentorship, and monastic support distinguishes it from purely magical practices.

# The Significance of Physical Contact

* The physical exchange of robes between the Buddha and Mahākassapa signifies a unique connection and transmission of virtue.
* This contrasts with the rejection of robes offered by Mahāpajāpatī, highlighting the importance of lineage and chosen successors.
* The concept of physical contact transmitting both good and bad qualities reflects an ancient belief in the materiality of sin and its potential for transfer.

# Ānanda and the Soiling of Robes

*  Ānanda, a devoted disciple, is rebuked by Mahākassapa for accidentally stepping on the Buddha's bathing cloth.
* This incident underscores the importance of purity and respect in Buddhist practice, even in seemingly minor actions.
* It also highlights the potential for ethical transgressions to arise from physical contact, even unintentionally.

# Patterns and Implications

* The text explores recurring themes of fire, transmission, lineage, and physicality in both Buddhism and Christianity.
* These patterns reveal underlying similarities and differences in how these religions conceptualize authority, power, and spiritual practice.
* The author encourages readers to critically examine the implications of these narratives within their respective religious contexts.

# Chapter 33 The Sage & The Golden Maiden

* Mahākassapa is often seen as misogynistic due to his association with a flower transmission from Buddha.
* However, he also received a heavenly blossom, symbolizing the Divine Feminine, highlighting a softer side.
* His verses in the Theragāthā reveal an appreciation for nature's beauty and bounty.

# The Sage & The Golden Maiden

* Mahākassapa's life story is intertwined with that of Bhaddā Kāpilānī, who became an arahant bhikkhuni.
* Their connection spans numerous past lives, filled with shared joy and meritorious deeds.
* In the time of 'our' Buddha, they were betrothed but both desired to renounce worldly life.

* They devised a plan using a golden statue to avoid marriage and ultimately went forth together.
* Their story emphasizes their commitment to spiritual liberation over material wealth and social expectations.

# The Romance of Mahākassapa and Kāpilānī

* This story recounts the separation of Mahākassapa and Kāpilānī, two ascetics who were once married.
* Their parting was prompted by Mahākassapa's fear that their close relationship might be misconstrued as inappropriate by others.
* The narrative draws parallels with other Buddhist tales like the Cullabodhi Jātaka and Kusa Jātaka, highlighting recurring themes of ideal marriage and spiritual partnership.

# Literary Influences and Interpretations

* The story borrows elements from various Jātakas, suggesting a composite narrative rather than a historical account.
* It reflects the Buddhist community's idealized image of Mahākassapa as a stern yet spiritually elevated figure.
* Kāpilānī is portrayed as his anima figure, embodying feminine qualities and complementing his masculine energy.

# Gender Dynamics and Symbolism

* The story subtly reinforces traditional gender roles by associating Mahākassapa with the "right" side (skillful, auspicious) and Kāpilānī with the "left" side (associated with femininity, desire, and transgression).
* While Mahākassapa does not express misogynistic views, Kāpilānī's acceptance of societal expectations regarding women reflects the internalization of patriarchal norms.




# Kāpilānī's Formalized Honoring of Mahākassapa

* Kāpilānī's formalized honoring of Mahākassapa at their parting was typical for wives to husbands in that culture.
* It is similar to the worship Kuṇḍalakesā pays to her husband before shoving him off a cliff, showing cultural norms underlying the garudhamma requiring nuns to bow to monks.

# The Problem with Kāpilānī's Statement about Women

* Kapilānī states that women are an obstacle for the ascetic, a misogynist opinion also found in her past life Jātaka.
* This irony reminds us of women in Buddhist countries today who oppose nuns, especially bhikkhunis, in monasteries.

# The Story's Two Aspects

* The story presents two aspects: a fairy tale of spiritual partners and an implicit endorsement of women's inferiority.
* The author believes the fairy tale perfection expresses the profound meaning while sexism is a limited counterpoint.

# Kāpilānī's Later Life

* Kāpilānī lived with non-Buddhist wanderers for five years before ordaining as a bhikkhuni.
* This detail solves the problem of Mahākassapa's early ordination and the later establishment of the bhikkhuni order.

# Kāpilānī and Mahākassapa After Parting

* The Pali story says their relationship ended, but traditions record several points of contact.
* Tibetan sources allege that non-Buddhist monks desired Kāpilānī, and Mahākassapa encouraged her to join the Buddha's teachings.

# Mahākassapa's Support for Kāpilānī

* After ordination, Mahākassapa provided care and support for Kāpilānī when she needed it.
* He gave her half of his alms to protect her from harassment, showing him as a protector of women in these stories.

# Kāpilānī's Attainment and Verses

* Soon after ordination, Kāpilānī attained arahantship.
* Her verses in the Therīgāthā depict their lives and attainments as complementary, expressing spiritual harmony between masculine and feminine.

# Kāpilānī as a Teacher

* Kāpilānī became a well-known teacher, training many nuns.
* She faced jealousy from Thullanandā, another nun who was attached to her reputation as a teacher.

# Mahākassapa's Conflict with Thullanandā

* After the Buddha's passing, Ānanda invited Mahākassapa to teach at the bhikkhuni monastery.
* A nun criticized Mahākassapa, and he responded defensively, highlighting the conflict between them.

# Pali vs. Chinese Versions

* The Pali version emphasizes the conflict between Mahākassapa and Ānanda, portraying Mahākassapa as arrogant and defensive.
* The Chinese versions soften the conflict, revealing the harshness in Mahākassapa's character to be an illusion of the redactors.

# Archetypal Pattern of Conflict

* Mahākassapa and Kāpilānī represent Higher Masculine and Feminine, while Thullanandā/Thullatissā and Ānanda represent Lower Feminine and Masculine.
* Their fates differ: Mahākassapa and Kāpilānī succeed, while the nuns fail and disappear from the texts.

# Chapter 34 The Soft Twin

* Mahākassapa and Ānanda are presented as opposites in Buddhist tradition.
* Mahākassapa is old, strict, aloof, and associated with fire; Ānanda is young, gentle, involved, and associated with water.
* Ānanda's devotion to the Buddha is emphasized, comparing him to a devoted wife.

#  Ānanda's Emotional Nature

* The story of King Mahāsudassana and Queen Subhaddā parallels Ānanda's grief over the Buddha's passing.
* Both stories involve a ruler withdrawing from worldly affairs, a loved one pleading for them to stay, and acceptance of impermanence.
* This parallel highlights Ānanda's emotional nature, which was considered feminine in those times.

# Ānanda and the Devotional Tradition

* Ānanda is associated with the devotional tradition, particularly the worship of the Bodhi tree.
* The planting of the Bodhi tree sapling in Sāvatthi symbolizes the Buddha's presence even when he is absent.
* This act connects Ānanda to goddess worship and the feminine aspect of Buddhism.

# Ānanda and Women

* Stories depict Ānanda as handsome and attracting attention from women.
* He handles these situations with detachment, teaching Dhamma instead of succumbing to temptation.
* Satirical stories about Ānanda distributing cakes highlight his perceived connection to women, though he denies any sensual desire.

# Ānanda's Past Life

* She seeks divine help from the Bodhisatta in the form of a Great Brahmā.
* The Bodhisatta engages the king in a debate on virtue and its consequences, using reason and psychic powers to persuade him.

# Ānanda's Connection with Cloth

* Ānanda is associated with cloth and fashion, having designed the basic pattern for Buddhist monastic robes.
* This association may stem from his past life as a tailor who offered a needle and cloth to a Paccekabuddha.
* The motif of cloth appears repeatedly in stories about Ānanda receiving gifts of robes from women.

# Ānanda's Role in the Sangha

* Ānanda often acts as a donor to the Sangha, distributing robes and food.
* This role is typically associated with lay people, particularly women.
* The accumulation of material goods by the Sangha is seen as potentially corrupting.

# Mahākassapa's Ascendance

* After the Buddha's death, Mahākassapa emerges as a leader, claiming authority and organizing the First Council.
* Ānanda, despite his close relationship with the Buddha and knowledge of the teachings, is not initially chosen to participate in the Council.
* This highlights the tension between Ānanda's spiritual attainment and Mahākassapa's stricter interpretation of Buddhist principles.

# Ānanda's Attainment and Participation in the Council

* On the eve of the Council, Ānanda attains full arahantship.
* He is eventually included in the Council but not asked to speak first.

# The Debate on Abolishing Rules

* After Upāli recites the Vinaya, Ānanda reveals that the Buddha had suggested abolishing lesser rules.
* This sparks a debate, with Mahākassapa ultimately advocating for maintaining all existing rules.
* Despite this outcome, Mahākassapa criticizes Ānanda for not being mindful enough to remember the Buddha's words about the rules.

# The First Was That Ānanda Stepped on the Buddha's Bathing Cloth

* This seemingly trivial incident is significant within the narrative of robe-offering.
* It highlights Mahākassapa's pedantic rigorism and contrasts with his earlier actions towards Mahāpajāpatī and Ānanda.

* This criticism refers to events in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, where the Buddha praised Ānanda for managing the order of worshipers.
* Mahākassapa specifically criticizes Ānanda's allowing women to worship, highlighting the tension surrounding women's roles.

# The Next Criticism Was That Ānanda Did Not Beg the Buddha to Live on for an Æon

* This episode involves the Buddha's claim that he could live longer if he wished, and Ānanda's failure to grasp this point until it was too late.
* The episode is seen as bizarre and potentially indicative of a later, supernaturalized view of the Buddha.

# Which Brings Us to the Last, and Presumably the Worst, of Ānanda's Offenses: the Ordination of Women

* Mahākassapa offers no explanation for why this is wrong, assuming the reader knows about the 500-year doom pronounced on women's ordination.
* Ānanda defends his actions based on familial gratitude towards Mahāpajāpatī, reinforcing the theme of "Lower Masculinity."

#  It Is No Coincidence That Ānanda, the Subject of the Test, Was a Relative of the Buddha

* The episode can be seen as a test for Ānanda, who has recently attained arahantship.
* Early Buddhism's familial nature is highlighted, with tensions between Śākyans being imported into the Sangha.

# Ānanda's Response Shows His Triumph

* He asserts himself, stating that he saw no wrongdoing in his actions, demonstrating "Higher Masculinity."
* He then humbly apologizes, showing "Higher Feminine" qualities of gentleness and flexibility.

* His willingness to work with the community and prioritize their welfare showcases his mastery of "Higher Feminine" qualities.

# Chapter 35 What A Woman Wants

* Freud was unable to answer the question "What does a woman want?" despite his extensive research.

# The Mahājanaka Jātaka

* In this story, the Bodhisatta (future Buddha) wins the hand of Princess Sīvalī by demonstrating his strength and character, not by succumbing to her tests.

* They live happily for five years until Dame Ragnell dies.

# The Nature of Sovereignty

* The gift of sovereignty transforms the woman from a loathly object to a beautiful bride.
* Sovereignty is connected with domestic arrangements and control over land.
* The story's magical elements suggest deeper roots in ancient pagan traditions.

# Ancient Traditions and the Woman as Sovereignty

* In Irish and Germanic legend, marrying a hag-like figure who represents the land grants sovereignty.
* This archetype connects to Mother Earth, the land itself, and the right to rule.
* The story of Sir Gawain may retain links to these ancient pagan traditions.

#  A Woman's True Desire

* Sources from both east and west agree that a woman's truest desire is sovereignty.
* This has a dual nature: sovereignty over her man and over the land.
* Trust and freely offered autonomy are key to true relationships, unlike rules that bind and control.

# The Contrast with Buddhist Rules

* These rules contrast with the stories' message of granting women sovereignty through autonomy.
* True relationships require equality and mutual respect.





# Chapter 36 The Heroine

# The Deeper Meaning of Dohaḷa

* The story explores themes of transgression, sacrifice, and the hidden power dynamics within relationships.
* The wife's desire acts as a catalyst for the husband's transformation and elevation to a higher social standing.
* The motif of *dohaḷa* is prevalent in Indian literature, often symbolizing the influence of the unborn child on the mother's desires.

# Dohaḷa in Other Cultures

* A Jaina tale illustrates the concept of *dohaḷa* through the story of Queen Padmavatī, whose desire for a royal elephant ride leads to unexpected consequences.
* The queen's experience highlights the connection between fertility, ritual, and the emergence of ascetic figures.

# Interpretations and Analysis

* Scholars have attempted to classify *dohaḷa* stories based on their themes and outcomes.
* However, these classifications often overlook the deeper psychological and social implications of the motif.
* Feminist perspectives suggest that *dohaḷa* stories can be interpreted as expressions of female agency and resistance against patriarchal norms.

# The Psychological Dimension

* Some scholars view *dohaḷa* cravings as symbolic projections of the mother's emotional state during pregnancy.
* They argue that these desires reflect ambivalence, guilt, and a subconscious desire to reclaim control over one's body.

# Chapter 38 The Flowering Of The World
* The *dohaḷa* story-type stems from an old mythic form best preserved in Jātakas.
* Basic features include a woman expressing yearning for a specific object; a man searches for it, succeeding or not; and the means used varies.

* Different tellings can be classified as 'lower', 'middle' or 'higher'. 
    * 'Lower' forms feature jackals or crocodiles with limited goals and transformation.
    * 'Middle' forms feature humans seeking more profound transformation.
    * The most common form is an exalted quest for a mythical animal, where compassion leads to success.

* The Mahāmora Jātaka exemplifies this highest form.

* While acknowledging Brahmanical beliefs, the text presents them as trickery, highlighting the Buddhist perspective on achieving enlightenment.
* Khemā, queen of Benares, embodies stillness and passivity, representing a source of creative energy that sets the story in motion.

## Khemā's Role

* Her dream, a prophecy of the peacock teaching the Dhamma, reflects her unconscious power to influence events.
* Khemā's stillness aligns with the ideal of an Awakened One, emphasizing peace and stability as virtues in Buddhism.
* She represents safety (Khemā) and Nibbana, embodying a feminine archetype that transcends conventional roles.

## The Power of Archetypes

* Khemā's posture of lying down, turning away from the king, signifies her embodiment of the archetypal Khemā, wielding unseen power.
* Her influence compels the king to seek help from brahman advisors, who represent patriarchal wisdom but lack connection to the living reality of the peacock.

# The Hunters

* Hunters are despised yet necessary.
* They represent a brutal and archaic way of life.
* In the story, the hunter embodies Khemā's animus, the "Beast" to her "Beauty."

# The Quest for the Peacock

* The hunter sets out to capture the golden peacock, but is foiled by its mantras.
* Both the hunter and Khemā die in their quest, which represents an eternal cycle.
* The original quest was for wisdom (Dhamma), not to kill the peacock.

# The Hunter's Transformation

* The final hunter succeeds through guile rather than brute force.
* This marks a shift from earlier heroes who relied on strength and bravery.
* The peacock, representing the Higher Masculinity, is ultimately vulnerable.

# The Fall of the Peacock

* The hunter captures a peahen to seduce the peacock, exploiting his sensuality.
* This highlights the Lower Feminine's role in bringing down the Higher Masculine.
* The peacock's vulnerability stems from his suppressed lust.

# Compassion and Awakening

* Recognizing their shared humanity, the hunter feels compassion for the peacock.
* This empathy leads to a crucial change in the hunter's heart.
* The hunter chooses to release the peacock, seeking wisdom instead of worldly rewards.

# The Debate on Afterlife

* The hunter questions the existence of an afterlife, prompting the peacock's refutation.
* The peacock uses the sun and moon as evidence for a realm beyond our world.
* This argument reflects ancient beliefs in celestial divinity.

# Ethical Conduct and Rebirth

* The text emphasizes the connection between ethical conduct and future lives.
* The hunter's questioning leads to his awakening as a Paccekabuddha.
* He realizes the three characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and not-self.

# The Paccekabuddha

* This figure represents a solitary sage who achieves enlightenment independently.
* They are acknowledged in Buddhist texts alongside "proper" Buddhas.
* The inclusion of the Paccekabuddha motif is a later adaptation to Buddhism.

# Chapter 39 Her Dreaming

* This chapter explores variations of the *dohaḷa* story across different Jataka tales.
* The stories highlight the archetypal situation of a woman's dream leading to a man's heroic journey.
* Different versions feature animals like golden deer, geese, and peacocks symbolizing higher masculinity.

# Other Versions of the Story

*  The Ruru Jātaka features a golden deer rescued by a merchant's son who betrays him but is ultimately forgiven by the Bodhisatta.
* The Rohantamiga Jātaka involves a deer king who is snared but saved by a compassionate hunter, leading to the spread of Dhamma.

#  The Haṁsa Jātaka and Mahāhaṁsa Jātaka

* These tales involve a golden goose caught and released by a compassionate hunter who brings it to the king, resulting in the king's conversion to Dhamma.
* The stories emphasize the importance of compassion and the transformative power of Dhamma.

# Significance of the Cycle

* This cycle of *dohaḷa* tales represents a key to understanding mythology, integrating the feminine and masculine archetypes.
* It shows how the woman's dream initiates the man's journey, highlighting their interdependence.
* The stories emphasize the importance of relationship and compassion in achieving unity and safety.

# Archetypal Completion

* The golden beasts symbolize higher masculinity, while the hunter represents lower masculinity.
* The king's journey mirrors this dynamic, transitioning from violence to peace through Dhamma.
* Khemā's dream symbolizes the integration of intuition and wisdom, leading to universal happiness.

#  The Meaning of *Dohaḷa*

* The term *dohaḷa* has multiple meanings, including "bad-heart," "two-heart," and "giver of milk."
* It represents the woman's journey from negativity and ambivalence to nurturing and abundance.
* The stories suggest that listening to a woman's wishes, guided by intuition rather than reason, can lead to universal happiness.

#  The Sālabhañjikā Motif

* This motif depicts women playfully interacting with trees, symbolizing both creation and destruction.
* It reflects the ambivalent nature of feminine energy, capable of both nurturing and destructive power.
* The *dohada* aspect emphasizes the bountiful and life-giving aspects of this archetype.

# Māyā's *dohadas*

* The term *dohada*, often translated as "instinctive impulse," is used to describe both positive and negative desires in Buddhist literature.
* Māyā, the Buddha's mother, had five *dohadas*, which are considered higher forms of desire and serve to unite her inner desires with her symbolic role.

# The Significance of the Oceans

* Māyā's first wish was to drink the water of the four oceans, symbolizing a desire for universal knowledge and understanding.
* This symbol is similar to the Bodhisatta's dream before his awakening, where he envisions himself reaching all four oceans with his limbs, representing the universality of his teachings.

# The Magician and the Tower

* A magician named Raktākṣa fulfills Māyā's wish by magically producing the water of the four oceans for her to drink atop a tower.
* This setting evokes the archetype of the bounded female awaiting liberation, with the tower symbolizing confinement and the oceans representing freedom.

# Liberation from Bonds

* After tasting the universal waters, Māyā wishes for the liberation of all beings from their bonds.
* This reflects her expanded compassion and understanding that all beings share in the same fundamental nature.

# Gifts and Offerings

* Māyā's third wish is for gifts and offerings to be made by all, emphasizing the importance of sharing and responsibility in a liberated society.
* This ensures that freedom leads not to chaos but to blessings for all.

# The Journey to Lumbini

* Māyā's final two wishes are more personal and relate to her journey to Lumbini, where she will give birth to the Buddha.
* These wishes connect her to her archetypal home, the grove, and the sāl tree, symbolizing her connection to nature and her role in bringing forth the Buddha. 




# Chapter 40 Things Hidden Since The Beginning

* Secrets are not hidden but plain to see, found in everyday life and Buddhist symbolism.
* The Buddha is represented by symbols like the lotus, tree, stupa, footprints, wheel, bowl, and seat, all connected to the Higher Feminine archetype.
* These symbols represent concepts like enlightenment, compassion, wisdom, and the cyclical nature of existence.
