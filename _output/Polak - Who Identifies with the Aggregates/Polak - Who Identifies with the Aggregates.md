## Introduction

* The doctrine of the five aggregates (khandha) in Pali Nika¯yas criticizes the notion of self (attā).
* Some passages analyze the nature of self, while others focus on cognitive attitudes towards aggregates leading to wrongly seeing them as self or correctly as not-self (anattā).

## Who Identifies With The Aggregates?

*  The question is who or what regards the aggregates as "I am this" (esohamasmi).
* Traditionally, Therava¯da views "person" or "being" as conventional designations for a continuity of aggregates.
* This raises the problem of whether the aggregates themselves can be considered the agent of this attitude.

* Some scholars question if khandhas are an exhaustive account of a human being.
* Identifying with something is correct when the agent and object of identification are identical, otherwise mistaken.
* If "I am this" is mistaken, it implies the "uninstructed ordinary worldling" is not identical to the five aggregates, challenging the traditional Therava¯din interpretation. 




## Khandha Similes And Their Philosophical Implications

* Some Nikaya texts imply a distinction between individual and aggregates.
* The Bhāra-sutta states that five aggregates are burdens, while the bearer is a person.

## Similes Implying Distinction Between Aggregates and Individual

* Vammika-sutta: Sage uses knife to delve within anthill, finding things to be abandoned and finally a Nāga serpent to keep. Anthill represents body, discarded items represent negatively evaluated elements, turtle represents khandhas, and Nāga represents bhikkhu who ended taints.
* Natumhākaṃ-sutta & Alagaddupama-sutta: Buddha asks disciples to imagine carrying grass, sticks, etc., then asks if they think they are being carried by these items. Disciples say no, explaining that the items are not self. Buddha advises abandoning aggregates, leading to welfare and happiness.
* Ānanda-sutta: Simile of young person looking at facial image in mirror or bowl of water. Suggests notion "I am" arises from grasping aggregates or is dependent on them.

## More Similes

* Gaddulabaddha-suttas: Leashed dog bound to sturdy post, running around it. Represents ordinary person regarding aggregates as self, constantly revolving around them.
* Nadī-sutta: Man carried by swiftly flowing river tries to save himself by clutching plants on banks, but they break. Compares this to ordinary person clinging to aggregates as self, experiencing calamity when they break down.
* Yamaka-sutta: Person wanting to kill householder wins his favor first. Compares this to ordinary individual failing to see aggregates as selfless, impermanent, etc.

## Interpretation of Similes

* Similes imply distinction between aggregates and individual displaying attitudes towards them.
* Commentaries sometimes share similar view, interpreting similes as referring to dichotomy.
* Necessity of not identifying with khandhas emphasized in Natumhākaṃ-sutta and Alagaddupama-sutta.

## Philosophical Implications

* Similes suggest five khandhas are not the only components of a human being.
* Difficult to find simile perfectly conveying classical Theravada interpretation of not-self doctrine.
* Dichotomies in similes could have been avoided if authors intended no distinction between aggregates and individual.




## What Are The Aggregates?

* The aggregates may represent aspects of subjective, phenomenal, and globally available experience rather than objective constituents of reality.
* This interpretation aligns with scholarly views suggesting the khandhas focus on the experiencing subject's understanding of conditioned existence.
* Phenomenality implies something is directly accessible to experience, qualitative, and potentially expressible through language or action.

## Phenomenality and Global Availability of the Khandhas

* The khandhas, particularly mental aggregates like feeling and perception, exhibit characteristics of phenomenality and global availability.
* They are directly experienced, possess a qualitative "what it is like" character, and can be expressed verbally and remembered.
* Some texts suggest all aggregates are available for direct experience, with the Tathāgata having seen their origin and subsiding.

## Rūpa as Phenomenal

* Understanding rūpa (form) as phenomenal rather than objective matter involves viewing it as one's own body as a constant element of experiencing the world.
* This subjective representation of the body is implied in the Kalahavivādasutta, where rūpa vanishes in a state beyond perception.

## Implications of a Phenomenal Understanding

* A phenomenal interpretation of the aggregates has profound implications, suggesting the existence of non-phenomenal and non-globally available aspects of experience.
* This aligns with cognitive science's recognition of unconscious mental processes that contribute to consciousness but are not directly accessible.




## Can The Mind Work In A Khandha-Less Way?

* Some Nika¯ya texts suggest forms of cognition not conceptualized in terms of the five aggregates.
* The Mūlapariyāya-sutta describes a heightened state of cognition where one "directly knows" (abhijānāti) elements, implying absence of saññā.
* The Paramaṭṭhaka-sutta suggests even subtle saññā is absent in a pure, direct cognition.

## Citta and the Mental Aggregates

* Several passages suggest a distinction between citta/cetas and mental aggregates.
* The Dutiyasikkhattayasutta states that with cessation of consciousness (viññāṇa), release of the mind (cetas) is like extinguishing a lamp.
* The Vāhana-sutta implies citta/cetas and viññāṇa are not the same faculty.

## Citta Detached from Khandhas

* Texts like Mahāmālukya-sutta and Jhāna-sutta describe turning the mind (citta) away from dhammas related to aggregates towards the deathless property.
* The Anicca-sutta states citta can be detached from properties of all five khandhas.


## Abhidhamma Perspective

* According to Dhammasaṅgaṇī, vedanā, saññā, saṅkhāras and viññāṇa are present in every mind moment.
* A historically dominant trend identifies viññāṇa with citta.
* However, Nika¯ya texts sometimes use viññaṇa and citta/cetas with different denotations and in distinct contexts.

## Phenomenological vs Functional Perspectives

* Viññāṇa seems to provide key features of phenomenal experience like qualia, "what it is like" character, self-givenness, and intentionality.
* Citta, on the other hand, is presented functionally as a mental faculty capable of performing cognitive tasks and producing knowledge.
* Nika¯ya authors seem to keep usage of citta and viññāṇa restricted to their specific contexts, implying possible separation.

## Two Complementary Perspectives

* The Nika¯yas may offer two perspectives on human beings: phenomenological (represented by aggregates and sense bases) and quasi-functional (represented by citta/cetas, indriyas, and perhaps kāya).
* While āyatanas represent unique qualitative modalities of consciousness, indriyas seem to be a functional account of senses.

## The Aggregates

* Descriptions of citta and indriyas are not used in the same way as rūpa and kāya.
* Indriyas are said to be very pure during cessation, described from a third-person perspective.
* There is a distinction between rūpa and kāya implied in the Vammika-sutta simile.
* The Kalahavivāda-sutta mentions rūpa vanishing, but not kāya.
* The difference between rūpa and kāya is not clearly outlined in the Nika¯yas.

## Phenomenal vs. Cognitive Descriptions

* The Nika¯yas do not aim to provide a comprehensive account of human cognition.
* Functional accounts of cognition should not use the khandhas, while phenomenological descriptions do not refer to citta.
* Identifying with the aggregates may mean identifying with the contents of one's own phenomenal experience.


## Are The Aggregates Active Processes Of Cognition?

* Some modern philosophers see consciousness as passive and agency residing in unconscious cognitive modules.
* This view contrasts with the early Buddhist understanding, which might see aggregates as active processes.
* Hamilton opposed the notion of khandhas as objective constituents but still saw them as selfless cognitive processes.
* The Dhammasaṅgaṇī defines saññākkhandha as encompassing both the process and its result.

## Reinterpreting Khandhas

* The historically dominant interpretation of khandhas as active processes lacks unequivocal basis in the Nika¯yas.
* Some suttas (Khajjanīya-sutta, Mahāvedalla-sutta) might imply aggregates perform cognitive functions.
* However, these suttas do not explicitly state that feeling feels or consciousness cognizes.

## Saṅkhāras as Constructed Phenomena

* Saṅkhāras are traditionally seen as active constructing processes in Theravada Buddhism.
* Nizamis challenges this view, arguing grasping cannot belong to the sphere of constructed phenomena.
* The Bhūmija-sutta suggests saṅkhāras are results of an activity performed by an individual.

## Saṅkhāras and All Phenomena

* Some Nika¯ya passages equate saṅkhāras with all experienced phenomena, not just a subgroup.
* This aligns with the passive reading of saṅkhāras as constructed aspects of phenomenality.

# What Does It Mean To Identify With The Aggregates?

* Identifying with aggregates means an individual identifies with their phenomenal experience, particularly their representation of themselves.
* This concept aligns with Metzinger's "phenomenal self-model" hypothesis, where our brain creates a virtual reality representation of ourselves.
* We identify with this model, believing it to be reality, leading to a sense of ownership and agency.

# Concluding Remarks

* Absolute certainty regarding the interpretation of Nikaya texts is difficult to achieve due to limited evidence.
* The proposed interpretation offers a plausible explanation for various passages and minimizes interpretative problems.
* This hypothesis aligns with Theravada Buddhism's reductionist view, seeing humans as combinations of parts and processes.
* It emphasizes the mistaken identification with our phenomenal self-representation as one aspect of the Buddhist critique of the self.
