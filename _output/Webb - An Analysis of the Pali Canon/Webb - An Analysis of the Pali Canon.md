## 5.3. Mahāvagga:

* King Bimbisāra tempts the Buddha with material resources and asks about his lineage. The Buddha states he was born a Sakyan and has seen through sensual pleasures' illusory nature.
* Māra tempts the Buddha before Enlightenment.
* Bhikkhus should speak well, pleasingly, correctly, and truthfully.

* Brahmn Sela and his 300 followers convert to Buddhism after conversing with the Buddha.
* Life is short and everyone dies, but those who understand life fear nothing.

* Two young men debate whether one becomes a brahmin by birth or actions; the Buddha confirms that actions determine brahminhood.

## 5.4. Aṭṭhakavagga:

* Avoid sensual pleasures to avoid their unpleasant consequences.
* Don't cling to physical existence for deliverance from *saṃsāra*.
* Those who praise themselves and hold dogmatic views live restricted lives; sages remain humble and independent of philosophical systems.

* Knowledge of philosophy doesn't purify; clinging to anything in *saṃsāra* leads astray. True wisdom avoids passion and attachment.
* Don't engage in philosophical disputes; true brahmins attain Nibbāna without them.
* Greed and regrets stem from selfishness; ideal Bhikkhus are independent and seek no purification through others.

* The Buddha explains the undesirable effects of sensual contact.
* Debates where both sides insult each other are futile and prevent purification.
* Purity comes from inward peace, not philosophical systems.

* A true sage is free from craving, anger, desire, passion, attachment, calm, thoughtful, and mentally balanced.
* Arguments arise from deeply felt objects.
* Different schools of philosophy contradict each other without realizing Truth's unity.

* Philosophers praise themselves and criticize others; true brahmins remain indifferent to such intellectual pursuits and are peaceful.
* Bhikkhus should sever evil's root, learn Dhamma, be calm and meditative, avoid talking, indolence, etc., and follow their duties.

* A sage is truthful, undeceitful, sober, free from greed and slander, energetic, and desires no fame.
* The Buddha lays down principles for a Bhikkhu's life in response to Sāriputta's inquiry.

## 5.5. Pārāyanavagga:

# Iii. Bibliography 1. Translated Texts

* The Pali Text Society (founded in 1881) has published English translations of the Pali texts from 1909. As of 2006, only the Niddesa and Apadāna from the Khuddaka Nikāya and Yamaka from the Abhidhamma Piṭaka remain untranslated out of the entire Canon. Apart from their own series (PTS, and SBB—*Sacred Books of the Buddhists*), there are five others of note: Sacred Books of the East (SBE—reprinted from the 1960s by UNESCO via Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi); The Wheel and *Bodhi Leaf* series of the Buddhist Publication Society (BPS); The Mahā Bodhi Society in either India or Sri Lanka (MBS); the (now defunct) Bauddha Sahitya Sabha (Buddhist Literature Society—BSS); and the Buddhist Missionary Society (BMS) of Kuala Lumpur. In addition, a few individual texts have appeared from Sinhalese, Indian, Burmese, Thai, English, and American publishers.

* To avoid the tedium of indicating the years of reprints of those works that have run into several editions, only the years of the first and latest editions have been shown. In the case of BPS publications, however, because these are normally kept in print, only the year of initial publication is shown).
