## The Threefold Refuge

* The Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha are the "Three Jewels" and represent the most precious things in a Buddhist's life.
* They form the "Threefold Refuge," which Buddhists affirm through reciting a formula three times.
* This formula declares one's acceptance of these as guides for their life and thought.

## The Five Precepts

* These moral precepts are the minimum standard for ethical conduct in Buddhism.
* Observing them is essential for living a decent life and progressing towards liberation.
* They include abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxicants.

# The Word Of The Buddha

OR

THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS

* Understanding the Four Noble Truths is crucial to ending suffering.
* These truths are: the truth of suffering, the origin of suffering, the extinction of suffering, and the path leading to the extinction of suffering.
* Only by comprehending these truths can one achieve supreme enlightenment.

# I The First Noble Truth The Noble Truth Of Suffering

* This truth encompasses various forms of suffering: birth, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, and not getting what one desires.
* These are explained in detail, including the physical and mental aspects of each form.
* The "five groups of existence" are also identified as sources of suffering.

## The Five Groups Of Existence (Pañcupádánakkhandhá)

* These five groups encompass all physical and mental phenomena: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.

## I. The Truth Of Suffering 9

* These groups represent a comprehensive classification of existence, including what is mistakenly perceived as the self or personality.


## The Group Of Corporeality (Rúpa-Khandha)

* This group consists of the four primary elements (earth, water, fire, wind) and corporeality derived from them.
* Each element is explained in detail, along with examples of how they manifest in the body.
* It emphasizes that all physical phenomena are impermanent and not truly "self."

## The Group Of Feeling (Vedaná-Khandha)

* There are three types of feeling: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral.


## THE GROUP OF PERCEPTION (saññá-khandha)

* Perception involves recognizing six classes of objects: forms, sounds, odors, tastes, bodily impressions, and mental objects.

## The Group Of Mental **Formations** (**Saòkhára-Khandha**)

* There are six classes of volition (*cetaná*): volition directed to forms, sounds, odours, tastes, bodily impressions, and mental objects.
* The "group of mental formations" (*saòkhára-khandha*) is a collective term for numerous functions or aspects of mental activity which, in addition to feeling and perception, are present in a single moment of consciousness.

* In the Abhidhamma, fifty mental formations are distinguished, seven of which are constant factors of mind.
* The number and composition of the rest varies according to the character of the respective class of consciousness.

## THE GROUP OF C**ONSCIOUSNESS** (*viññáóa-khandha*)

* There are six classes of consciousness: consciousness of forms, sounds, odours, tastes, bodily impressions, and mind-objects.

## Dependent Origination Of Consciousness

* The arising of consciousness is dependent upon conditions; without these conditions, no consciousness arises.
* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the eye and forms, is called eye-consciousness (*cakkhu-viññáóa*). 
* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the ear and sounds, is called ear-consciousness (*sota-viññáóa*).

* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the olfactory organ and odours, is called nose-consciousness (*ghánaviññáóa*).

## I. The Truth Of Suffering 14 **The Word Of The Buddha**

* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the tongue and tastes, is called tongue-consciousness (*jivhá-viññáóa*).
* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the body and bodily impressions, is called body-consciousness (*káyaviññáóa*).
* Consciousness, whose arising depends on the mind and mind-objects, is called mind-consciousness (*mano-viññáóa*).

## Dependency Of Consciousness On The Other Four Khandhas

* It is impossible for anyone to explain the passing out of one existence, and the entering into a new existence, or the growth, increase, and development of consciousness, independently of corporeality, feeling, perception, and mental formations.

## The Three Characteristics Of E**Xistence** (**Tilakkhaóa**)

* All formations are transient (*anicca*); all formations are subject to suffering (*dukkha*); all things are not-self (*anattá*).
* Corporeality is transient, feeling is transient, perception is transient, mental formations are transient, consciousness is transient.

## The Anattá D**Octrine**

* Individual existence, as well as the whole world, is in reality nothing but a process of ever-changing phenomena which are all comprised in the five groups of existence.
* The five groups of existence—either taken separately or combined—in no way constitute a real ego-entity or subsisting personality, and equally no self, soul, or substance can be found outside of these groups as their "owner."

* In view of the impermanence and conditionality of all existence, the belief in any form of self must be regarded as an illusion.
* This is, in brief, the *anattá* doctrine of the Buddha, the teaching that all existence is void (*suñña*) of a permanent self or substance.

## I. The Truth Of Suffering

* Whoever delights in corporeality, or feeling, or perception, or mental formations, or consciousness, he delights in suffering; and whoever delights in suffering, will not be freed from suffering.
* How can you find delight and mirth Where there is burning without end? In deepest darkness you are wrapped! Why do you not seek for the light?

## The Three W**Arnings**

* Did you never see in the world a man or a woman, eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, frail, crooked as a gable-roof, bent down, resting on crutches, with tottering steps, infirm, youth long since fled, with broken teeth, grey and scanty hair or none, wrinkled, with blotched limbs?

* Did you never see in the world a man or a woman who, being sick, afflicted, and grievously ill, wallowing in his own filth, was lifted up by some and put to bed by others?
* Did you never see in the world the corpse of a man or a woman, one or two or three days after death, swollen up, blue-black in colour, and full of corruption?

## S**AÍSÁRA**

* *Saísára*—the wheel of existence, lit. the "perpetual wandering"—is the name given in the Páli scriptures to the sea of life ever restlessly heaving up and down, the symbol of this continuous process of ever again and again being born, growing old, suffering, and dying.
* *Saísára* is the unbroken sequence of the fivefold *khandha*-combinations, which, constantly changing from moment to moment, follow continually one upon the other through inconceivable periods of time.



## I. The Truth Of Suffering

* Humans have experienced immense suffering throughout countless lifetimes.
* This suffering is exemplified by the loss of loved ones and the bloodshed caused by violence.
* The cycle of rebirth, driven by ignorance and craving, is inconceivable in its length and depth.

## Ii. Origin Of Suffering

* The origin of suffering is craving, which leads to rebirth and fuels attachment to pleasurable experiences.
* There are three types of craving: sensual craving, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.

## Dependent Origination Of All Phenomena

* Craving arises from attachment to pleasant experiences perceived through the senses and mind.
* This clinging leads to a cycle of becoming, birth, decay, death, and suffering.

## Present Karma-Results

* Sensual craving fuels conflict, violence, and crime, resulting in suffering for individuals and society.

## Future Karma-Results

* Evil actions driven by craving lead to rebirth in lower realms of existence, perpetuating suffering.
* There is no escape from the consequences of our deeds.

## Karma As Volition

* Karma refers to volitional actions performed through body, speech, and mind.
* These actions have consequences that ripen in various realms of existence, including this life, future lives, and even hellish realms.

## Inheritance Of Deeds

* Beings are responsible for their own actions and inherit the consequences thereof.
* The fruits of our deeds will manifest in accordance with the law of karma.


## Iii The Third Noble Truth The Noble Truth Of The Extinction Of Suffering

* The extinction of suffering is achieved through the complete eradication of craving.
* This involves recognizing the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of pleasurable experiences.
* By abandoning attachment to these experiences, craving and its associated suffering cease.




## 26 Iii. The Extinction Of Suffering

*  The annihilation of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) is the extinction of suffering.
* This extinction is likened to the cessation of waves when the wind stops and stored energy dissipates.
* Similarly, craving ceases, leading to the end of the five-aggregate process at death for an arahant.

## N**Ibbána**

*  Nibbána is peace, the end of karma formations, and the fading away of craving.
* It brings freedom from mental pain and grief by abandoning lust, hatred, and delusion.

## The Arahant Or Holy One

* An arahant is free from suffering and unshaken by external influences.
* They have attained deliverance and peace.

## The I**Mmutable**

* There exists a realm beyond form, sensation, or change – the Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed.
* This realm offers escape from the cycle of birth and death.


## Iv The Fourth Noble Truth

* The Noble Eightfold Path avoids both indulgence and self-mortification.
* It leads to peace, discernment, enlightenment, and Nibbána.

## 30 Iv. The Noble Truth Of The Path

* The Noble Eightfold Path consists of:
    * **Wisdom:** Right understanding, right thought
    * **Morality:** Right speech, right action, right livelihood
    * **Concentration:** Right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration
* Morality is developed first, followed by concentration, and finally wisdom.

## First Factor

RIGHT U**NDERSTANDING**
(*sammá-diþþhi*)

* Understanding the Four Noble Truths: suffering, its origin, its extinction, and the path to its extinction.
* Understanding wholesome and unwholesome actions:
    * Unwholesome actions (akusala) are rooted in greed, hatred, or delusion.
    * Wholesome actions (kusala) are the absence of these roots.

* Understanding the Three Characteristics (Tilakkhaóa): all phenomena are transient, subject to suffering, and not-self.

## Unprofitable Q**Uestions**

* It is unwise to delay seeking liberation from suffering by demanding answers to metaphysical questions about the nature of reality.
* Just as someone with a poisoned arrow wouldn't wait to learn about the archer before having it removed, we should prioritize ending our suffering now.

## Five F**Etters** (**Saíyojana**)

* The five fetters are: self-illusion, scepticism, attachment to mere rule and ritual, sensual lust, and ill-will.
* These hinder a person from attaining liberation.

## Right Understanding

* Self-illusion can manifest as eternalism (belief in a permanent soul) or annihilationism (belief that the self ceases to exist after death).

## Unwise C**Onsiderations**

* An unwise person dwells on unproductive questions about the past, present, and future, leading to doubt and confusion.
* They adopt one of six views about the self, all of which are ultimately incorrect.

## The Six Views About The Self

* These views include believing in a permanent self, denying the existence of a self, or confusing the self with something else.

## Wise C**Onsiderations**

* A wise person focuses on understanding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.

## The Sotápanna Or Stream-E**Nterer**

* By understanding these four noble truths, a person can overcome the first three fetters and enter the stream leading to liberation.

## Right Understanding

* Entering the stream is more valuable than any worldly power or pleasure.

## The Ten F**Etters** (**Saíyojana**)


* The ten fetters are: self-illusion, scepticism, attachment to mere rule and ritual, sensual lust, ill-will, craving for fine-material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance.
* Overcoming these fetters leads to liberation.

## The Noble Ones (**Ariya-Puggala**)

* There are four stages of holiness: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and arahant (perfectly holy one).
* Each stage is characterized by the overcoming of certain fetters.


## MUNDANE AND SUPRAMUNDANE U**NDERSTANDING**

* Mundane right understanding recognizes the reality of karma, rebirth, and the existence of enlightened beings.
* Supramundane right understanding is wisdom that leads to liberation.

## Right Understanding

* There are two types of eightfold path: mundane (practiced by worldlings) and supramundane (practiced by noble ones).

## Conjoined With Other S**Teps**

* Right understanding is accompanied by right effort and right mindfulness.

## Free From All T**Heories**

* A Buddha is free from all theories because they have directly understood the nature of reality.


## The Three C**Haracteristics**

* All conditioned phenomena are impermanent, subject to suffering, and not-self.
* This is a fundamental truth regardless of whether Buddhas appear in the world or not.

## Right Understanding

* Wise people do not believe in a permanent, unchanging self.

## Views And Discussions About The Self

* There are three kinds of feeling: pleasurable, painful, and indifferent feeling. Each is impermanent and subject to decay. Identifying with any of these leads to the belief in a self that dissolves when the feeling fades.
* Feeling cannot be separate from the self because without feeling there can be no sense of "I."

* The mind, mind-objects, or mind-consciousness are not the self because they arise and pass away. 
* It's better to consider the body as self than the mind because the body lasts longer.
* All corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, past, present, or future, should be understood as not belonging to the self.

## Past, Present, And Future

* One has been in the past, will be in the future, and is now. Each of these states is real only in its own time.


## Right Understanding

* Dependent origination (*paþiccasamuppáda*) is perceiving the truth; one who perceives the truth perceives dependent origination.
* Past, present, and future are merely conventional designations. The Perfect One uses them without clinging to them.
* Without understanding corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness as void of a self, one may believe in the continuation or non-continuation of the Perfect One after death.

## The Two Extremes And The Middle Doctrine

* Believing that the vital principle is identical with the body or something different from it prevents a holy life.
* The Perfect One avoids these two extremes and teaches the Middle Doctrine of dependent origination.


## Dependent Origination (Paþicca-Samuppáda)

* Dependent origination explains how ignorance leads to suffering through a chain reaction of causes and conditions.
* This chain starts with ignorance, leading to karma formations, consciousness, mental and physical existence, sense organs, sensorial impression, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming, rebirth, decay and death, sorrow, etc.
* A disciple who has overcome ignorance heaps up no karma formations.

* Through the extinction of ignorance, all subsequent links in the chain are extinguished, leading to the cessation of suffering.


## Rebirth-Producing Karma

* Beings, driven by ignorance and craving, seek fresh delight, leading to continuous rebirth.
* Actions done out of greed, hatred, and delusion ripen wherever one is reborn, producing their fruits in this or future lives.

## Cessation Of Karma

* Through the fading away of ignorance and the arising of wisdom, craving ceases, and no future rebirth occurs.
* Actions not rooted in greed, hatred, and delusion are abandoned and destroyed.


## Right Understanding 49

* Dependent origination (*paþicca-samuppáda*) explains that physical and mental phenomena arise from causes and conditions.
* It shows how rebirth and suffering depend on these conditions and how their removal leads to the cessation of suffering.

# Dependent Origination
* This diagram shows how the twelve links of the formula extend over three consecutive existences: past, present, and future.
* The links 1–2, together with 8–10, represent the karmaprocess, containing the five karmic causes of rebirth.
* The links 3–7, together with 11–12, represent the rebirth-process, containing the five karma-results.

# Third Factor RIGHT SPEECH (*sammá-vácá*)
* Right speech is abstaining from lying, tale-bearing, harsh language, and vain talk.
* Mundane right speech yields worldly fruits.
* Supramundane right speech is not of the world but is supramundane and conjoined with the path.

# Fourth Factor RIGHT ACTION (*sammá-kammanta*)
* Right action is abstaining from killing, stealing, and unlawful sexual intercourse.
* Mundane right action yields worldly fruits.
* Supramundane right action is not of the world but is supramundane and conjoined with the path.

# Fifth Factor RIGHT LIVELIHOOD (*sammá-ájìva*)
* Right livelihood is earning one's living by a right way of living, avoiding wrong ways.
* Mundane right livelihood yields worldly fruits.
* Supramundane right livelihood is not of the world but is supramundane and conjoined with the path.



## 58 **The Word Of The Buddha** 58 Conjoined With Other F**Actors**
* Right livelihood is accompanied by right understanding, right effort, and right mindfulness.

## Right Livelihood

## Sixth Factor

RIGHT E**FFORT**
(*sammá-váyáma*)

## 1. The Effort To A**Void** (**Saívara-Padhána**)
* This involves avoiding the arising of evil unwholesome states that have not yet arisen by controlling the senses.

## 60

# Right Effort 2. The Effort To O**Vercome**

(*pahána-padhána*)
* This involves overcoming evil unwholesome states that have already arisen through various methods like turning away from the object, reflecting on its misery, ignoring it, considering its compound nature, or suppressing it with mental effort.


## 3. The Effort To D**Evelop** (**Bhávaná-Padhána**)
* This involves developing wholesome states that have not yet arisen by cultivating factors of enlightenment like mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.

## 4. The Effort To M**Aintain** (**Anurakkhaóa-Padhána**)
* This involves maintaining the wholesome states that have already arisen and bringing them to full perfection through focused attention on a favourable object of concentration.

## Right Effort

* The four great efforts are essential for ending suffering.

## Seventh Factor RIGHT M**INDFULNESS**
(*sammá-sati*)
* Right mindfulness is cultivated through the four foundations of mindfulness: contemplation of the body, feeling, mind, and mind-objects.

## 64 **The Word Of The Buddha** 64 Right Mindfulness

* Contemplation of the body involves mindful breathing, observing the arising and passing away of the body, and understanding its impermanent nature.
* Mindfulness of breathing can be used for developing tranquillity, insight, or both. It involves calming the breath and observing its origin, leading to an understanding of the impermanence, suffering, and non-self nature of the body and mind.

## Right Mindfulness

* **Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension:** The disciple acts with clear comprehension in all activities, understanding their intention, advantage, duty, and reality.

* **Contemplation of Loathsomeness:** The disciple contemplates the body's physical components and impurities, recognizing its impermanent nature.

* **Analysis of Four Elements:** The disciple analyzes the body in terms of the four elements (solid, liquid, heating, vibrating), understanding its composite nature.

## Cemetery Meditations

* The disciple meditates on the decaying stages of a corpse, realizing the impermanence and inevitability of death for their own body.
* This contemplation helps them detach from attachment to the physical form.

## Assured Of Ten Blessings

* Practicing these meditations leads to ten blessings: mastery over discontent and fear, endurance of hardship, access to meditative absorptions, development of psychic powers, including heavenly ear, telepathy, past life recollection, divine eye, and ultimately, liberation through wisdom.

* **Objects:** The four foundations of mindfulness.
* **Requisites:** The four great efforts.
* **Development:** Practicing, developing, and cultivating these things.
* Two degrees: neighbourhood concentration (approaches absorption) and attainment concentration (concentration present in absorptions).
* Absorptions are mental states beyond sense activity, attainable through solitude and perseverance.
* Realization of the four supramundane paths requires insight into impermanence, suffering, and selflessness, attained during neighbourhood concentration.



## The Four A**Bsorptions** (**Jhána**)

* Detached from sensual pleasures and evil states, the disciple enters into the first absorption. 
* This absorption is characterized by thought conception, discursive thinking, rapture, happiness, and concentration.

## Right Concentration

* The second absorption is free from thought conception and discursive thinking but includes rapture, happiness, and concentration.
* The third absorption involves equanimous happiness and concentration.
* The fourth absorption is characterized by concentration and equanimity.

## Gradual Development Of The Eightfold Path In The Progress Of The Disciple

* They know that rebirth is exhausted and their holy life is fulfilled.
* Nibbana is the highest peace, appeasement of greed, hatred, and delusion.

# The Silent Thinker

* Thoughts like "I am", "I am this", etc., are vain thoughts and should be overcome.
* A silent thinker does not arise, pass away, tremble, or desire anymore.

# The True Goal

* The purpose of the holy life is unshakable deliverance of the heart, not wealth, honor, fame, or even morality, concentration, or wisdom.
