## Chapter 1




## Introduction

* Research into early Buddhism suggests that communicating freedom from suffering was central to the Buddha's teaching.
* His aim was pedagogical rather than ontological, focusing on benefiting his students through varied expressions tailored to their needs.
* The Great Seal instructions of the Eighth Karmapa offer a valuable source for understanding this pragmatic approach within Tibetan Buddhist traditions.

## 1.1 Aim And Scope Of This Research

* This thesis analyzes the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal teachings, arguing that they demonstrate a pedagogical pragmatism based on teacher-student interaction.
* It investigates the Karmapa's life and selected Great Seal teachings, examining how he taught specific students in various contexts.
* The research focuses on textual genres like spiritual biographies, question and answer texts, meditation instructions, esoteric precepts, and advice.
* Case studies of these genres will contextualize the Great Seal teaching and the Karmapa's interpretations, focusing on non-tantric Great Seal and the teacher's role.
* This study utilizes the recently published *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*, offering a new perspective on his life and writings.

## 1.2 Methodologies Employed

* Scholars in Buddhist Studies are increasingly debating their methodologies.
* This thesis utilizes different methodological approaches based on the sources and aims of the research.
* It primarily employs philological and historical methodologies with a phenomenological perspective of 'ad hoc hermeneutics'.
* Occasionally, modern and post-modern literary theories like intertextuality and narratology are used for comprehending spiritual biographies (*rnam thar*).

##  Textual Hermeneutics

* This research aims to understand religious ideas and concepts from an emic perspective, particularly when dealing with the Karmapa's interpretations of the Great Seal.
* It strives for an undistorted *Verstehen*, using categories and terms employed by the tradition.
* Findings are critically analyzed and contextualized.

##  Approach to the Eighth Karmapa's Teachings

* The thesis investigates the Great Seal teaching of the Eighth Karmapa as expressed to specific students in its historical, doctrinal, and literary contexts.
* It provides context for the Eighth Karmapa's religious career.
* A case study approach is used to examine teachings to different students.
* The presentation alternates between translation of crucial passages and analysis of historical context and doctrinal content.

## Importance of Philology

* Philology is essential for understanding Buddhist texts, as highlighted by scholars like Tillemans and Nye.
* Translating terms accurately is crucial, as emphasized by Dreyfus.

##  Genre and Context

* The thesis explores contexts within and beyond normative doctrines using textual sources.
* It combines the genre of spiritual biographies with tools from narratology to enrich the examination.


## Reflexivity and Collaboration

* The researcher acknowledges the limitations of any method and the subjectivity inherent in research.
* Consultation with Tibetan scholars enhances understanding, especially regarding the reception and use of texts today.
* An empathic as well as critical approach is adopted.
* The insider/outsider dichotomy is acknowledged, recognizing that everyone is a co-participant in formulating narratives about religion.



## 1.3 Previous Research On The Life And Works Of The Eighth Karmapa

*  Previous scholarship on the Eighth Karmapa is limited and has not fully utilized the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*.
* Gregor Verhufen's Master's thesis (1995) focuses mainly on the Karmapa's relationship with his teacher, Sangs rgyas mnyan pa.

* Hugh Richardson briefly mentions the Eighth Karmapa in 'The Karmapa Sect: A Historical Note', focusing on his relation to the Chinese Emperor Wu-tsung.
* Nick Douglas and Meryl White provide a basic description of the Eighth Karmapa's life in *Black Hat Lama* (1976).

* Karma Thinley summarizes the Eighth Karmapa's life in *The Sixteen Karmapas of Tibet* (1980) from a traditional perspective.
*  Academic literature on the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal is inadequate, with few studies explicitly discussing his theory and practice.

* Samten G. Karmay uses Tibetan sources authored by the Eighth Karmapa in *The Great Perfection* (1988), presenting his polemics against the rNying ma pa.
* Paul Williams discusses the Eighth Karmapa's view on Madhyamaka in two papers (1983a, 1983b), focusing on his critique of dGe lugs pa Madhyamaka.
* David Seyfort Ruegg explores the Eighth Karmapa's commentary on Madhyamaka in *et passim* (1988).

# Existing Research on the Eighth Karmapa

* Discusses research by various scholars like Ruegg, Lopez, Stearns, Brunnhölzl, Draszczyk & Higgins, Mathes, Kapstein, Martin, Jackson, Schaeffer, Ruegg, Braitstein, and Phuntsho.
* Highlights that most of these works only mention the Eighth Karmapa briefly or focus on other aspects of Tibetan Buddhism.

# Translations of the Eighth Karmapa's Works

* Mentions translations by Glenn Mullin, Nālandā Translation Committee, and Nitartha Institute.
* Notes that these translations are often limited in scope and lack historical context.

# Research on the Great Seal

* Points out the scarcity of academic work on the Great Seal, particularly from the bKa' brgyud tradition.
* Emphasizes the need for further research into the textual material of earlier Great Seal proponents like Marpa, Zhang, and Phag mo gru pa.
* Acknowledges the challenges in analyzing the Great Seal due to its nature and the prevalence of question-and-answer texts as primary sources.

# The Need for Further Research on the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal

* States that there is a lack of historical studies on the Eighth Karmapa's life and his Great Seal teachings.
* Identifies this research as an attempt to address this gap by examining a new range of sources, clarifying basic facts about his life, and emphasizing selected Great Seal teachings across different textual genres.

# 1.4 Plan Of This Book

* Chapter One presented the main argument and related research questions. It explained the methodologies applied and discusses the relevance of previous research.
* Chapter Two introduces the doctrinal and historical contexts through the Great Seal distinctions of Kong sprul (1813–1899), and explains key points of the bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal and sGam po pa. 
* It outlines the Great Seal critique of Sa skya Paṇḍita, which became the subject of many medieval bKa' brgyud pa apologetics and explains the tense religio-political conditions the Eighth Karmapa was confronted with.
* Chapter Three critically evaluates the main textual sources and genres employed. 
* It briefly surveys the main sources for the Great Seal analysis: question and answer texts (*dris lan*), meditation instructions (*khrid*), esoteric precepts (*man ngag*), and advices (*bslab bya*).
* Chapter Four examines how the Eighth Karmapa became one of the most prominent scholars and mystical teachers of his tradition. 
* It explores how a rival candidate for the title of Karmapa, and the problematic religiopolitical situation resulting, may have reinforced his intellectual development.
* Chapter Five investigates concrete teaching situations through three case studies: dialogues embedded in the spiritual biography by A khu a khra, the Gling drung pa la 'dor ba'i dris lan (Answer to a Question Asked by Gling drung pa La 'dor ba) and the *Phyag rgya chen po'i byin rlabs kyi ngos 'dzin* (*Identification of the Blessing of the Great Seal*).
* Chapter Six further examines the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructtions in a broader context; taking into account passages from additional meditation instructions and question and answer texts. 
* It establishes the guru as the common origin, means, and unifying spiritual element of Great Seal practices of any approach, suggesting that an essential instruction is, according to circumstance, taught via either tantric or non-tantric means.
* Chapter Seven concludes by advocating Great Seal instructions as pedagogical devices in which categorisation is subordinated to experience and realisation.

# Chapter 2 The Great Seal And 15Th To 16Th Century Tibet

* The Marpa bKa' brgyud and later Dwags po bKa' brgyud (the lineages which passed through sGam po pa) are meditative traditions whose essential practices comprise the Great Seal and the six doctrines of Nāropa.
*  The word 'bKa' brgyud' means: 'transmitted precept' or 'succession of precepts' and relates principally to any teaching passed on from teacher to student.

* A brief presentation of a later bKa' brgyud master, Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas (1813–1899), may aid an initial survey: he distinguished a generally accepted mantra Great Seal, a sūtra Great Seal, and an essence Great Seal.
* Mantra Great Seal involves receiving tantric empowerment from one's guru and subsequent training in the two stages of meditation.

* Sūtra Great Seal is defined by its connection to the *pāramitāyāna*, being in accord with tantra, and focusing on the pith instruction of not becoming mentally engaged (*amanasikāra*) on the basis of sūtra teachings and practices (such as *śamathā* and *vipaśyanā* meditations).
* Essence Great Seal constitutes the sudden realisation of one's 'natural mind' (*tha mal gyi shes pa*), which is the perfection inherent in any experience.

* The progressive stages of meditative development in the Great Seal are portrayed by the bKa' brgyud masters on the basis of the 'four trainings' (*rnal 'byor bzhi*): 'one-pointedness' (*rtse gcig*), 'free from concepts' (*spros* bral), 'one taste' (*ro gcig*), and 'non-meditation' (*sgom med*).
* The Great Seal is often further distinguished into basis, path, and fruition.

## 2.1.2 Sgam Po Pa, Early Bka' Brgyud Pa, And The First Karmapa

* sGam po pa is crucial for studying the bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal traditions.
* He united monastic bKa' gdams pa with tantric bKa' brgyud pa.
* He distinguished three paths: sūtra, mantra, and Great Seal.
* The novelty of his teaching was considering the path of direct perception self-sufficient and introducing it without prior tantric empowerment.

## 2.1.3 Sa Skya Paṇḍita, Indian Great Seal, And Later Systematisations

* In the thirteenth century, Sa skya Paṇḍita critiqued the bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal teachings.
* He argued that a single method was insufficient for enlightenment and that the Great Seal should be taught within a tantric context.
* bKa' brgyud traditions defended sGam po pa's teaching by pointing to Indian origins in the works of Jñānakīrti, Maitrīpa, and Sahajavajra.
* They also highlighted the Indian Great Seal siddhas Saraha and Kāṇha's *Dohākoṣa* and Tilopa's *Mahāmudropadeśa*.
* Later masters like 'Gos Lo tsā ba and Karma 'phrin las pa emphasized Maitrīpa as a key figure in Great Seal teachings.
* The Eighth Karmapa's teacher, Karma 'phrin las pa, wrote commentaries on Saraha's *dohā*.
* Other masters contributed to more systematic manuals of meditative practices.

## 2.2 Tibet From The Fifteenth To Sixteenth Centuries: Conflicts Between Dbus And Gtsang

* Political situation was characterized by tension between Phag mo gru pa of dBus and gTsang-based Rin spungs pa.
* Karma bKa' brgyud enjoyed support from the Rin spungs pa, reaching its peak between 1498 and 1517 during the Eighth Karmapa's early life.

* Tai Si tu Byang chub rgyal mtshan ended the Sa skya pas' primacy under Mongolian patronage in 1354.
* Phag mo gru pa lords initially supported bKa' brgyud pa but later became strong supporters of Tsong kha pa and his disciples.
* Tsong kha pa had a significant impact on Tibetan Buddhism, particularly on scholasticism and clerical education.

* Rin spungs pas gradually seized power from the weakening Phag mo gru pa, culminating in their control of crucial rDzong Shigatse in 1478.
* Fourth Zhwa dmar pa was involved in a patron-priest relationship with the Rin spungs pa and supported the Seventh Karmapa.

* Rin spungs pa attacked dGe lugs monasteries in 1498, leading to conflict and their control of dBus and gTsang until 1517.
* During this period, dGe lugs monks were excluded from Great Prayer Festivals, highlighting the political tensions.

* Phag mo gru pa continued as figureheads under Rin spungs pa rule, with Nga dbang bKra shis grags pa enthroned in 1499.
* Rin spungs pa lost direct control of dBus in 1518, leading to the reinstatement of dGe lugs monks in Great Prayer Festivals.

* Eighth Karmapa inherited a politically influential yet delicate position during a time of religious scholasticism and sectarian developments.
* He avoided traditional centers of dBus and gTsang for thirty years before settling at mTshur phu in 1537.


## Chapter 3: Textual Sources For The Eighth Karmapa'S Life And Great Seal

* This chapter examines the textual sources used to study the Eighth Karmapa's life and Great Seal teachings.
* It analyzes the history of his writings, surveys his *Collected Works*, and selects and evaluates relevant texts for this thesis.
* The chapter identifies the closest possible textual witnesses and explains why their genres are suitable for the analysis. 





## 3.1. History Of The Eighth Karmapa'S Writings

* Hand copying and block-printing were the main methods of Tibetan literary production.
* Block-printing became widespread in Tibet by the late fifteenth century, requiring funding from wealthy patrons or lamas.
* In the bKa' brgyud tradition, printing was established partly by gTsang smyon He ru ka and his students.

* The first edition of the Eighth Karmapa's writings was a manuscript collection compiled around 1555, shortly after his death in 1554.
* Key figures in compiling this collection were the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa dKon mchog yan lag and dPa' bo gtsug lag 'phreng ba.

* The Fifth Zhwa dmar pa received instructions from the Eighth Karmapa and created a table of contents for his works, completed in 1555.
* Both the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's table of contents and an earlier list by the Eighth Karmapa are used to verify the authenticity of his writings.

* A golden manuscript comprising thirty volumes was produced soon after the Eighth Karmapa's death, sponsored by a noble nun named Chos mdzad ma rNam grol.
* This manuscript is no longer extant.

* Based on evidence, it is likely that the first blocks of a larger collection were carved under the supervision of the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa.
* Prints from this period are rare, supporting oral history suggesting printing was banned after 1642 when the Fifth Dalai Lama assumed power.




## 3.2 The Collected Works Of The Eighth Karmapa 2000–2004: Origins And Rubrics

* The twenty-six volume *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa* consists of newly discovered texts digitally inputted in Tibetan *dbu chen* script.
* Its compilation, editing, and printing were funded by the Tsadra Foundation.

* **Origins of the Texts**
    * Two incomplete versions of the Eighth Karmapa's writings were discovered in 'Bras spungs monastery.
    * Manuscripts formerly stored in Beijing were integrated.
    * The editors used the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's table of contents to arrange the collection.
    * Sources include manuscripts from 'Bras spungs, Potala, and the Nationalities Palace in Beijing.
    * Four commentaries from dPal spungs on *Madhyamakāvatāra, Abhisamayālaṃkāra, Vinayasūtra,* and *Abhidharmakośa* were used.
    * Texts reprinted by the Sixteenth Karmapa in India were included.
    * The Kālacakra commentary (*Phan* bde kun stsol) printed in woodblocks was also included.
    * 'Various writings and prints' from dPal spungs in Khams, Nang chen, Nyag rong were used.
    * Additional texts not mentioned in the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's table of contents were discovered.

* **Nature of the Texts**
    * Most of the texts were manuscripts.
    * The procedure for inputting the texts involved double entry and comparison with the original six times.
    * Old or deviant spellings were not adapted to a modern standard.

* **Philogical Issues**
    * Some orthographical mistakes are present.
    * The arrangement of texts does not always correspond with the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's *dKar chag*.
    * Some texts were mistakenly placed under one heading, while others were inserted twice.
    * A list of missing texts appended to the editorial supplement is misleading.

* **Rubrics**
    * The Fifth Zhwa dmar pa split *dKar chag* into six sections (*mdor byas*).
    * Section (i) contains spiritual biographies and vajra-songs.
    * Section (ii) includes letters, praises, questions and answers, advices, and prayers.
    * Section (iii) comprises commentaries on Indian treatises.
    * Section (iv) contains rituals and *sādhanas* for attaining the vajra-body.
    * Section (v) consists of meditation instructions (*khrid*).

    * Missing texts include parts of letter, praise, commentary, ritual, and grammatical sections.





## 3.3 Sources On The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal

* **Case Studies:** This section investigates how the Eighth Karmapa taught the Great Seal through various texts including spiritual biographies, question and answer texts, esoteric precepts, and advice.
* **Question and Answer Texts:** These texts are predominantly written answers to questions and often resemble letters or instructions. The *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa* contains sixteen such texts, ten of which deal with the Great Seal. This section focuses on the *gLing drung pa a 'dor ba'i dris lan*.
* **Advice Texts:** These are similar to meditation instructions and letters, often written upon request. Eight out of fifty-four advice texts in the *Collected Works* discuss the Great Seal. Two main sources used are *Phyag rgya chen po'i man ngag* and *Phyag rgya chen po'i byin rlabs kyi ngos 'dzin*.
* **Meditation Instructions and Esoteric Precepts:** These genres are closely related and crucial for Tibetan Buddhist practice. The *Collected Works* contains shorter meditation instructions (*khrid thung*) that are particularly relevant.

* **Other Occurrences of the Great Seal:**  The *Collected Works* also contain texts on the Great Seal in the vajra song section, commentaries, and teachings related to the 'Bri gung pa tradition.


## 3.4 Spiritual Memoirs And Biographies Of The Eighth Karmapa

* **Spiritual Biographies (rnam thar) and Memoirs (rang rnam):** These genres provide detailed accounts of Tibetan saints' lives and are considered "liberation stories." They function as historical records, religious instruction, and vehicles for cultural and religious identity.
* **Multi-Dimensional Function:** Spiritual biographies serve multiple purposes: narrating a saint's life, providing inspiration, and offering instructions for Buddhist practitioners. 

* **Role Models:** Tibetan saints often emulate the arhat (Theravāda), bodhisattva (Mahāyāna), or *mahāsiddha* (Vajrayāna). In the case of incarnate lamas like the Karmapa, they also embody the "abstract role of an incarnate lamaist priest."
* **Analyzing Content:** When using spiritual biographies as academic sources, it's important to consider their narrative function and potential biases. The historical accuracy may vary depending on the source and its purpose.

* **Principal Sources:** This section analyzes the primary sources used to depict the Eighth Karmapa's life, determining their reliability and investigating their content and intertextuality.

## (C) Spiritual Biographies By Later Tibetan Scholars

* **Main Sources:** The most useful primary sources for depicting the life of the Eighth Karmapa are three spiritual biographies written by his students and some spiritual memoirs. Two early sources by his students are missing, but the *Kaṃ tshang* by Si tu Paṇ chen seems to contain remnants of them.
    *  Later compilations often rely on *Kaṃ tshang*.

* **Other Sources:** Brief accounts based on these texts can be found in modern bibliographies, but they add little new information.

## Chapter 4: The Eighth Karmapa: Scholar, Monk, And Yogi

* **Focus:** This chapter provides a portrait of the Eighth Karmapa's life and spiritual program to understand him and his Great Seal teachings in context.
    *  It covers his childhood, education, practice of the Great Seal, scholastic contributions, political involvements, and later religious career.

* **Early Life (1507-1508):**
    * The Eighth Karmapa's reincarnation was disputed. 
    * He was born in Eastern Tibet near Karma dgon, a major Karma bKa' brgyud seat.
    * Si tu pa, the head of Karma dgon, tested the boy to confirm his identity as the reincarnation.



## 4.1.2 The Dispute About The Incarnation (1508–1513)

* A dispute arose over the identity of the Eighth Karmapa, with two candidates emerging.
* The rival candidate was supported by powerful figures like the Phag mo gru pa regents and Rin spungs pa general Don yod rdo rje.
* The Fourth Zhwa dmar pa, a respected spiritual teacher, played a relatively low-key role in the recognition process due to political complexities.

* Despite facing challenges and poverty, the future Eighth Karmapa displayed wisdom and determination, seeking true dharma knowledge above the title of "incarnation."
* He demonstrated his abilities through recognizing ritual objects and uttering profound statements, aligning himself with other Buddhist masters. 
* The Karmapa engaged in dialogues asserting his superiority over the rival candidate, showcasing clairvoyant abilities.

*  The rGyal tshab Rin po che became instrumental in establishing the Karmapa's recognition after the Si tu pa's passing.
* In 1512, the Karmapa was invited to the Karma encampment for the first time, marking a crucial step towards his enthronement.
* The conflict between the two candidates reached its climax with the Karmapa's arrival at the encampment.




# The Recognition of the Eighth Karmapa

* Most people were overwhelmed by the charismatic presence of the boy from the east and started to prostrate and venerate him.
* The Karmapa was received in the encampment on New Year's Day of the bird year (1513).
* Both boys were brought before a large assembly where they were asked to answer questions and give blessings.

* The source mentions that at this point the inhabitants of the encampment had been split into two parties, each supporting one candidate.

* The rGyal tshab Rin po che tried to reconcile the parties and urged them not to become partial but to be upright and to trust in the analysis (*dpyod pa*) and careful examination of the candidates.
* Upon analysis it was revealed that the second candidate—though already seven years old—did not know more words than 'father, mother, and food and drink'.

* The rGyal tshab's efforts did not bear results at first.

* While public identifications continued, the boys were brought again into a row to identify statues and scroll paintings of former Karmapas.
* On one occasion the future Karmapa (the eastern boy) was even stopped from stepping on the throne.
* The rival candidate is reported to have failed to recognise a painting with the seal of a previous Karmapa.

* So heated was the atmosphere that the rGyal tshab Rin po che seems to have pondered a possible outbreak of violence.
* As no concurrence could be reached, the rGyal tshab suggested to the religious and political heads of the powerful provinces of Lho rong and rGya ston that they might remove the Karmapa from the camp.

* The inhabitants of these areas and their leaders considered this unacceptable, as the Karmapa had been decided as far as they were concerned, and threatened to drive out the other candidate and his party if they would not agree on the rightful Karmapa.
* Finally, adherents of the second candidate made concessions and informed the rGyal thsab they would concur.

* Narratives subsequently establish the Karmapa's authority and his continuity with his predecessor, the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rGya mtsho, through the ritual of enthronement.

* The boy from the East ascended the throne of his predecessor.
* He received the black hat, symbol of the Karmapas, and the title 'Victorious Great Karmapa' (*rgyal ba karma pa chen po*).

* The whole ceremony was a festivity, probably directly witnessed by a saṅgha of over three thousand and celebrated by an even larger number of devotees in the local markets.
* It is also said that offerings were sent by the Chinese emperor after the Karmapa was recognised.

* After the enthronement, on the fifteenth day of the second month of the bird year (1513), the Karmapa uttered praise to *dharmapāla* Mahākāla Ber nag chen and said that it would do away with all harm from non-human beings for the sGar pas.

* The last doubters in the camp were persuaded by the genuine Karmapa, when he exhibited clairvoyance in knowing that 'official' adherents of the western boy's party secretly already venerated him.
* The narrative relates this to a topos well known in spiritual biographies, finding parallels in the pre-birth stories of the Buddha: the bad times and the hesitation to take rebirth.

* Its positioning close to the events surrounding the reincarnation may suggest at least a connection.

* The Karmapa is said to have related to the rGyal tshab Rin po che that he stayed in [the pure realm of] dGa' ldan with Maitreya and in [the pure realm] Sukhāvatī and was happy.
* Then, because I was tired of people,57 I thought it would be pointless to come here for the time being. When [thinking so] the protector Maitreya and the wisdom-*ḍākinīs* said, 'you have to take rebirth in the world (*jambudvīpa*).' 
* Having taken rebirth until this year I have stayed in Lho rong.

* Nevertheless, in the same year the Karmapa himself urged his followers not to think badly about the other boy.

# 4.1.3 Early Exposition, Composition, And Travels (1513–1516)

* Following this, the Karmapa takes the first steps towards monkhood, and the narrative progresses to depict the deeds expected from a Buddhist meditation master and scholar: exposition (*bshad*), debate (*rtsod*), and composition (*rtsom*).
* Upon his enthronement in the third month of the bird year (1513), news of the Karmapa spread to all Karma bKa' brgyud monasteries in dBus and gTsang.

* It seems that at this time people became aware that his name, Mi bskyod rdo rje ('Unshakable Vajra') was given to him by Padmasambhava.
* Around this period, the Karmapa started to take Buddhist precepts and received another name, although the accounts vary slightly: According to the *rnam thar* by A khu a khra, on the third day of the fourth lunar month (of the bird year 1513), the Karmapa received from the rGyal tshab Rin po che the eight precepts of the daily fast, the *upavāsatha* vows, and was given the name *Chos skyabs grags pa dpal bzang* ('Dharma-Refuge, Good Radiant Glory').

* Then a few months later, on the third day of the eighth lunar month (*khrums kyi zla ba*), the rGyal tshab Rin po che performed a hair cutting ceremony in conjunction with inducted him into the 'going forth into homelessness' (*rab byung,* Skt. *pravrajyā*).

* Often, this term indicates the *śrāmaṇera*-vows of a novice monk.
* This ritual took place in 'O 
lung Yang dgon.

* *mKhas pa'i dga' ston* summarises the taking of vows in context of depicting the Karmapa's renunciation on the whole.

* After the first giving of his name, the rGyal tshab Rin po che, Mi bskyod rdo rje's first Buddhist teacher, taught him step by step to read and write (yi ge).
* He further passed on the empowerments of Hayagrīva and Vajravārāhī,66 as well as instructions (*khrid*) of Buddha aspects such as Jinasāgara, Vajrayoginī, and Mahākāla.

* From his enthronement onwards, the Karmapa began travelling more extensively, journeying to various places in Khams such as bSa' g.yu khang, Ras brag lun, Sho lha sde, and dGa' ldan.
* In the same bird year (1513), the dialogues analysed in Chapter Five take place: two occur between the first and second teachings of the rGyal tshab, and two follow them.

* In the ninth month, the Karmapa delivered his first sermon to a large assembly.
* On the twentieth day he left rDzong gsar68 for mDo khams and, ultimately, Ri bo che.

* Local monks and lamas invited him to the 'offering chamber' (*mchod khang*), and presented him with tea and other large gifts (in a welcome ceremony).
* After uttering auspicious prayers he taught the meditation instruction (*zab khrid*) on the *guru yoga* and others to a pleased assembly.

* Later he is said to have given the reading transmission to the meditation (*sgom lung*) of Avalokiteśvara to more then ten thousand people assembled in a market place.
* The earliest mentioned text was composed at the age of eight (1514): a commentary to a song (*mgur*) of Mi la ras pa, dealing with the Great Seal.

* The Karmapa then returned to Ngom, where he visited the birthplace of the Sixth Karmapa in Ngom shel.
* In the Re ne dgon seat he appointed dPal ldan bkra shis as abbot.

* He finally went to the famed Karma monastery, where he was received with great pomp.
* After briefly meeting two of his most important teachers, he was invited by Sangs rgyas mnyan pa of lDan ma to his monastery, Byang chub gling, where he was greeted by a large gathering.

* He then journeyed slowly to Li thang and Nyag rong, which at that time was a stronghold of the Karma bKa' brgyud pa, and finally returned north-eastwards to Zur mang bDe chen rtse.
* During these early years a patron-priest connection is forged, related by the narratives in typical fashion.

* The Karmapa accepted an invitation sent by the king of 'Jang Sa tham, an area very much south of Khams in today's south-west China.

* On the third day of the third month of the mouse year 
(1516) the Eighth Karmapa arrived in Sa tham, staying for seven days.

* The event is described as a pompous exchange of gifts, and the young Karmapa passed on teachings to the king, his wives, and the local population.
* As a result of this link, the king promised not to engage in war with Tibet for thirteen years; he sent five-hundred boys for a monastic education to Tibet each year, and founded a hundred monasteries.

* The king also provided extensive funding for religious buildings.



## 4.1.4 Becoming A Scholar And Training The Great Seal (1516–1529)

* The twelve years following his enthronement were crucial for the Karmapa's development as a scholar.
* He composed his first major scholarly work, a commentary on the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra*.
* Four teachers played a vital role in his education: Sangs rgyas mnyan pa bKra shis dpal 'byor, bDud mo ma bKra shis 'od zer, mKhan chen Chos grub seng ge, and Karma 'phrin las pa I Phyogs las rnam rgyal.
* The Karmapa referred to them as his "four great masters" due to their significant contributions to his spiritual growth.

## The Karmapa'S Education In General

* Accounts of the Karmapa's education often begin with his reception of the three vows: *upāsaka*, ś*rāmaṇera*, and bodhisattva vows.
* He studied commentaries related to monastic discipline, bodhisattva precepts, and esoteric precepts.
* Along with tantric empowerments, he studied root tantras, explanatory tantras, rituals, meditation instructions, and esoteric precepts from various schools, including the four schools and nine vehicles of the rNying ma pa tradition.

## Practice Of The Great Seal Under Sangs Rgyas Mnyan Pa

* The Karmapa received extensive training in the Great Seal under Sangs rgyas mnyan pa.
* He emphasized the importance of "training in pure appearances," perceiving his teacher as an embodiment of enlightenment.
* This practice is considered crucial for realizing the Great Seal, which involves recognizing the teacher's Buddha-nature and receiving blessings through oral transmission.
* The Karmapa received Kālacakra transmission from Sangs rgyas mnyan pa at mTshur phu.
* After Sangs rgyas mnyan pa's passing in 1519, the Karmapa had a vision of him during his funeral rites.

## Becoming A Scholar: Studies With Bdud Mo Ba Bkra Shis 'Od Zer

* bDud mo ba bKra shis 'od zer played a crucial role in shaping the Eighth Karmapa's development as a Buddhist scholar.
* The Karmapa relied on this teacher after Sangs rgyas mnyan pa's death until meeting mKhan chen Chos grub and Karma 'phrin las pa.
* bDud mo ba provided the Karmapa with intensive study in tantric teachings like Cakrasaṃvara and Zab mo nang gi don, as well as sutra teachings such as Maitreya's dharmas, pāramitās, and various doctrinal systems.

## Full Ordination And Formal Completion Of Studies

* At age twenty-one, the Karmapa met Karma 'phrin las pa and Chos grub seng ge, marking the final phase of his scholarly training.
* Karma 'phrin las pa was a learned scholar in both Sa skya and bKa' brgyud traditions, having tutored many prominent masters.
* The Karmapa received full ordination into monkhood (*bhikṣu*) on the third day of the eleventh month of the pig year (1527/28).
* Chos grub Seng ge was the *upādhyāya*, Karma 'phrin las pa the karmācārya, and dPal Shākya bzang po the *raho'nuśāsaka*.
* The Karmapa received the name of Chos grub grags pa dpal bzang ('Accomplished Dharma, Good Radiant Fame').

## Chapter 5 Case Studies Of The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal

* This chapter examines how the Eighth Karmapa taught the Great Seal directly to specific students.
* It analyzes three case studies of "instruction texts" focusing on genre, source selection, and analysis scheme.
* Criteria for selecting texts include content (Great Seal teachings), religious function (view or meditation instruction), form (concise texts), and intended audience.

## 5.1 Case Studies: Concrete Examples Of Teaching The Great Seal

* Three genres are investigated: dialogues in spiritual biographies, question-and-answer texts, and meditation instructions (*khrid*, *man ngag*, *bslab bya*).
* The analysis focuses on the historical context (place, addressee), doctrinal content (relation to other teachings), and adaptation of instruction based on the addressee.

## 5.2 Dialogues In A Khu A Khra'S Spiritual Biography

* Dialogues are scarce in the Eighth Karmapa's spiritual biographies.
* *A khu A khra* contains clearly quoted dialogues centered around Great Seal teachings, providing early textual witnesses of his instructions.

## 5.2.1 Their Function In The Main Narrative

* Dialogues in *A khu A khra* are not question and answer texts but two-way communications between the Eighth Karmapa and a student about Buddhist teaching.
* They are embedded non-narrative texts within the main narrative of the Eighth Karmapa's liberation.
* Narratological tools are used to understand their textual context, considering the narrator, perspective, and perceived information.

* The dialogues occur after the Karmapa's enthronement, following a series of events establishing his connection to the transmission lineage and demonstrating his abilities.

* They function as a display of the Karmapa's abilities as a realized teacher, showcasing his Great Seal teachings within the larger narrative structure.


## 5.2.2 Dialogue With A Khu A Khra

* The first dialogue takes place between the Eighth Karmapa and A khu a khra, the author of the spiritual biography, at sDe steng monastery in 1513.
* The setting shifts from a formal context to the private space of the Karmapa's bedroom, implying closeness between them.

* The Karmapa initiates the dialogue by stating that conceptualization is the *dharmakāya* and appearances are mind, expressing a core tenet of Great Seal teachings.

* A khu a khra objects, using concepts from Abhidharma metaphysics to argue for the distinction between thoughts, appearances, and mind.
* This objection likely serves as a rhetorical device to stimulate discussion rather than genuine disagreement.

* The Karmapa responds with strong language, emphasizing their close relationship and highlighting the limitations of conceptualization.
* A khu a khra continues to oppose the Karmapa's view, leading to further arguments about the nature of reality and the *dharmakāya*.

* The dialogue concludes with the Karmapa challenging A khu a khra to bring him a *dharmakāya* different from thoughts, employing a pedagogical technique reminiscent of pointing-out instruction.
* This dialogue centers on the Great Seal teaching that conceptualization and *dharmakāya* are essentially one, contrasting it with Abhidharma metaphysics.

* It highlights the inseparability of cyclic existence and nirvāṇa, leading to the spontaneous practice of the innate, transcending duality.

## 5.2.3 Dialogue With Rgya Ston Nang So Seng Ge Ba

* The dialogue centers around the concept of "ordinary mind" (*tha mal gyi shes pa*), a key term in the Great Seal tradition.
* The Karmapa equates conceptualization with *dharmakāya*, stating that they are undifferentiated.
* He uses similes like grains, stones, and empty space to illustrate the all-encompassing nature of ordinary mind.
* The Karmapa asserts that there is no size or difference between the ordinary mind at different times.
*  He emphasizes that everything, including Buddhahood, is contained within the ordinary mind.

## 5.2.4 Dialogue With Dga' Ldan Dbon Po Nam Mkha' Rgyal Mtshan

* This dialogue focuses on meditation practice.
* The Karmapa advises meditating "like space," emphasizing that concepts themselves are space.
* He criticizes the attempt to eliminate concepts through non-conceptualization, stating it hinders realization.
* The Karmapa suggests understanding concepts as *dharmakāya* is crucial for practicing Nāropa's teachings.

## 5.2.5 Dialogue With Mi Nyag Skya Ging Bya Bral Ba

* This dialogue addresses the student's difficulties with sickness and unclear meditation.
* The Karmapa advises removing obstacles through recognizing the essence of conceptualization.
* He cautions against harboring hope for results, stating it hinders true meditation.
*  He uses the metaphor of a dog's hair being equal to Buddha rays to illustrate the presence of enlightenment in ordinary things.
* The Karmapa concludes by demonstrating how a single hair embodies the three bodies of a Buddha. 




## 5.2.6 Conceptualisation And Dharmakāya

* The dialogues embedded within the narrative serve to portray the Eighth Karmapa as a realised teacher, particularly in relation to the Great Seal (and 'nature of mind' teachings).
* These dialogues likely stem from early interactions with the young Karmapa and were probably recorded by A khu a khra, his former secretary.
* The doctrinal content of the dialogues focuses on teachings about the nature of mind and its recognition as liberating insight.
* They emphasize conceptualisation as *dharmakāya*, aligning with the tradition of sGam po pa.

## 5.3 Answer To Gling Drung Pa'S Query On The Great Seal98

* This text is a written exchange between the Eighth Karmapa and Gling drung A mdong pa, addressing doctrinal issues related to the criticism of Sa skya Paṇḍita and the distinction between tantra and the Great Seal.
* While the exact context remains unclear, it is believed that Gling drung A mdong pa was related to other Gling drung pas mentioned in spiritual biographies about the Eighth Karmapa.

* The text was likely written after 1546, suggesting a period when the Eighth Karmapa was at his peak of scholarship and teaching.
* It is possible that Gling drung A mdong pa received teachings from both Sa skya and Ngor pa traditions before turning to the Eighth Karmapa for further guidance.





## 5.3.2 The Content

* The Karmapa addresses a question about the relationship between the fourth empowerment of the Sa skya tradition and the Great Seal as taught by the bKa' brgyud Dwags po Lha rje.
* He distinguishes between "mundane" and "supramundane" empowerments, arguing that only the Kālacakra tantra offers supramundane empowerment leading to the ultimate goal of the "pervading Vajrasattva."

* The Karmapa introduces the Great Seal of sGam po pa as distinct from both mundane and supramundane tantric empowerments.
* He emphasizes the spontaneity and immediacy of the Great Seal, achieved through resting in the mind's true nature rather than through ritualistic practices.
* The Karmapa recounts a story about Phag mo gru pa, who initially received the fourth empowerment from the Sa skya tradition but later embraced the Great Seal of sGam po pa.

* This anecdote suggests that the Karmapa considers the Great Seal of sGam po pa to be superior to the Sa skya's fourth empowerment.

## 5.3.3 The Story Of Sbas Mchod: Pedagogy, History, And The Great Seal

* This section investigates the story of Khams pa sBas mchod and its role in the Eighth Karmapa's teachings on the Great Seal.
* It examines the historical context surrounding Phag mo gru pa and his relationship with sBas mchod.
* The text explores discrepancies between the Karmapa's account and available sources, suggesting possible reasons for these variations.

## 5.3.4 Great Seal Beyond Tantra

* This section analyzes the Eighth Karmapa's response to a student's question about the Great Seal in relation to tantric practices.
* It highlights the Karmapa's emphasis on distinguishing the Great Seal from both mundane and supramundane tantras.
* The text explores the Karmapa's teaching style, which avoids direct argumentation and instead relies on storytelling and anecdotes.

## 5.4 Identifying The Blessing: A Mantra Path

* This section focuses on the Eighth Karmapa's instruction on receiving the blessing of the Great Seal.
* It outlines the Karmapa's view of the Great Seal as a tantric path leading to the realization of Vajradhara and the three Buddha-bodies.
* The text emphasizes the importance of receiving empowerments from an authentic teacher and practicing the two stages of tantric meditation.

## Chapter 6




## Contextualising The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal Instructions

* This chapter analyzes key ideas from case studies and investigates divergent interpretations of the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal teachings.
* It focuses on doctrinal elements within these teachings, emphasizing the role of the teacher in fostering confidence (*dad pa*) and devotion (*mos gus*) in students.

## 6.1 Basic Distinctions Of The Great Seal

* The Eighth Karmapa attributes the origin of Great Seal instructions to Saraha, who taught from an affirmative perspective, while his student Nāgārjuna emphasized negation.
* Maitrīpa's approach is crucial for understanding the Great Seal, according to the Karmapa. He draws upon Maitrīpa's *Tattvadaśaka*, Sahajavajra's commentary *Tattvadaśakaṭīka*, Jñānakīrti's *Tattvāvatāra*, and Saraha's songs.
* The Karmapa considers Maitrīpa's understanding of Madhyamaka to encompass the teachings of Saraha, Nāgārjuna, and Candrakīrti.

## 6.2 Interpretations Of Conceptualisation As Dharmakāya

* The chapter explores how the concept of conceptualization as *dharmakāya* is explained in further sources, particularly focusing on sGam po pa's teachings.
* According to the Karmapa, sGam po pa's approach, labeled 'Great Seal,' emphasizes realizing the ordinary mind (*tha mal gyi shes pa*) as the *dharmakāya*.
* The Eighth Karmapa clarifies that conceptualization arising as *dharmakāya* is a designation, not an ontological reality.



## 6.3 Common Strands And Divergent Interpretations

* The Eighth Karmapa distinguishes between tantric and non-tantric Great Seal practices, emphasizing its importance in removing clinging and conceptualization during meditation.
* He highlights the potential danger of symbolic experiences in tantric meditation not fully eradicating veils, using examples like Phag mo gru pa's initial experience with Sa skya Paṇḍita.

* The Karmapa acknowledges the possibility of teaching Great Seal directly without tantric empowerment, though he recognizes its origin within tantric traditions.
* He differentiates sGam po pa's approach from Atiśa's, suggesting that Atiśa's system was labeled "Great Seal" for pedagogical reasons.
* The Karmapa sometimes presents Great Seal as neither sūtra nor tantra, while in other instances he defines it strictly as tantric.

* He emphasizes the importance of an "essence Great Seal" for overcoming clinging and conceptualization, which may not be clearly categorized but is crucial for practice.
* This interpretation aligns with contemporary thinkers like bKra shis rnam rgyal who view Great Seal as an independent path potentially linked to both sūtras and tantras.

* The Karmapa's varied teachings on Great Seal highlight the significant role of the guru-disciple relationship in shaping its transmission and understanding.
* Further research is needed to fully comprehend the Karmapa's nuanced views on Great Seal and the pedagogical implications of the guru's role within this tradition.

## 6.4 The Guru As Origin And Example In Vajrayāna And Great Seal Traditions

* The guru is seen as an embodiment of all Buddhas and bodhisattvas in Vajrayāna Buddhism.
* The guru is the source of empowerment and instruction, crucial for spiritual development.
* The guru introduces students to their innate Buddha-nature.

* The guru transmits the meaning (*don brgyud*) of the Great Seal teachings.
* The guru's authenticity is established through lineage (*brgyud pa*), power/blessing (*adhiṣṭhāna*), and realization.
* Students should emulate the qualities and practices of their guru. 

* The Eighth Karmapa emphasizes the importance of a genuine teacher for liberation.
* He warns against false teachers who pretend spiritual development.
* The Karmapa's own teachings highlight the role of his guru, Sangs rgyas mnyan pa.




## 6.5 The Guru As Means In The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal Instructions

* This section examines the role of the teacher as both a means and goal of realization in the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructions that don't explicitly involve tantric practices.
* The text emphasizes the importance of "opening up" or "invoking" (*gsol 'debs*) the guru, which is considered essential for realizing all paths.

* This invocation involves constantly focusing one's body, speech, and mind on the teacher, rather than invoking them at specific times.

* The Karmapa connects his lineage's method of calm abiding and insight meditation to contemplating one's teacher.
* He emphasizes that in this tradition, one should not over-analyze conventionally but instead rest the mind in a way suitable for the Great Seal ultimate awareness to arise.

* This is achieved by invoking an authentic teacher who embodies all Buddhas and whose blessing enters the student's mind.

* The Karmapa relates this to sGam po pa's three paths: analysis, direct cognition, and blessing, equating the path of blessing with his lineage's tradition.
* Both calm abiding (*śamatha*) and insight meditation (*vipaśyanā*) are cultivated using the lama as a means.

* The face of the lama is used as an object of focus to achieve one-pointedness.

* Insight meditation involves settling the mind on all aspects of mental formations, an approach attributed to sGam po pa and the Third Karmapa Rang byung rdo rje.
* Devotion (*mos gus*) plays a crucial role in practice, both as a prerequisite and part of the actual practice.

* It is enhanced by *gsol 'debs* and helps concentrate the mind while fading conceptual states and allowing the teacher's power to enter the student's mind stream.


##  The Guru As Text 
* The Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructions emphasize the importance of emulating the teacher as a fundamental goal.

* This is evident in texts like *Thun bzhi bla ma'i rnal 'byor*, which starts with "Now, those who think only of me, Mi bskyod rdo rje ...".
* The concept of confidence (*dad pa*) towards the teacher and practices like *mos gus* and *gsol 'debs* are central pillars of Great Seal.

* These practices function as prerequisites, practices, and goals in themselves.

* This emphasis on guru devotion suggests that it is a key means for realizing the Great Seal, alongside insight.
* The Eighth Karmapa's teachings demonstrate flexibility, suggesting that the doctrine taught depends on circumstances.

## Chapter 7

* The aim of this thesis was to explore the Eighth Karmapa's life and writings, analyzing how he taught the Great Seal in specific contexts and textual genres.
* A solid foundation for this thesis and future research was laid through critical evaluation of Tibetan sources contained in the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*.
* The Eighth Karmapa can be considered the most significant scholar of the Karmapa lineage besides the Third Karmapa. 
* Despite involvement in Tibetan politics, his attitude towards the religio-political climate of the time was not enthusiastic.

## Conclusions

* The first half of the sixteenth century emerged as a crucial period for the Eighth Karmapa's life and teachings due to political and religious upheaval.
* Continued historical studies of the Eighth Karmapa's life are recommended, taking into account the spiritual biographies of his contemporaries and students.
* Regarding the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal, this book could only open the area of research and come to some preliminary conclusions on the basis of some case studies.
* The Karmapa's Great Seal instructions reveal the radical rhetoric of immediacy typical of Great Seal traditions.

* Three facets have become evident in the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal interpretations: instruction for understanding conceptualisation's true nature as Buddhahood, different approaches to this instruction, and the common origin of these instructions in the guru.
* Study of the instruction-related genres is vital for comprehension of the Great Seal.

* The doctrinal elements, stories, and role of the guru revolve around the rhetoric of the experience of a state beyond concepts.
* These case studies suggest that the Great Seal of the Eighth Karmapa is better understood as an adaptable and flexible pragmatic device, where experience is conceived of as superior to claims of ultimate truth.

## Jim Rheingans The Eighth Karmapa's Life and his Interpretation of the Great Seal

* Presents a book about the life and teachings of the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, a prominent figure in Tibetan Buddhism.
*  The book explores both his biography and his interpretation of the "Great Seal" doctrine (Mahamudra). 
* Provides bibliographic information including ISBNs for both print and ebook versions.

# Foreword
* The University of Hamburg's Asien-AfrikaInstitut focuses on South, Central, and East Asian religions with Buddhism as a core subject.
* Buddhist Studies has diversified into various approaches covering contemporary and historical aspects.
* Understanding Buddhism is crucial for modern multicultural societies in a globalized world.

*Hamburg Buddhist Studies* addresses Buddhism as a humanistic tradition of philosophical thought, religious praxis, and social life. 
* The series aims to engage scholars from diverse disciplines and encourage wider interest in the academic study of Buddhist traditions.

## About Thisvolume
* Jim Rheingans' book is a thorough investigation of the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje (1507–1554) and his mahāmudrā instructions.
* The book analyzes Buddhist instructions for meditative insight, specifically Tibetan Kagyüpa mahāmudrā, as pragmatic heuristics adapted to different disciples.
* Rheingans examines selected texts ascribed to the Eighth Karmapa and introduces his religious life based on primary sources.

* The book surveys textual sources for studying the Karmapa's life and works, showing how traditional biographies portray him as a learned scholar and accomplished meditator.
* It critically assesses Mikyö Dorje's mahāmudrā teachings, arguing that they are less a static system than independent teachings adapted by the guru to individual students.

* Rheingans interprets previously unstudied Tibetan texts and manuscripts from historical and narratological perspectives.
* His work contributes significant insights into Tibetan religious history and sets innovative methodological impulses in studying Tibetan Buddhism.

# Preface
* This book argues for analyzing Buddhist instructions, specifically those of the Tibetan Kagyüpa *mahāmudrā*, as a pragmatic heuristic adapted to students' needs.

* It focuses on selected writings of Mikyö Dorje (1507–1554), the Eighth Karmapa, and contextualizes his religious life.
* The book investigates Mikyö Dorje's life and examines his Great Seal instructions in context. 
* It argues that analyzing his Great Seal teachings reveals a pedagogical pragmatism, viewing it as an independent key instruction adapted to students' needs rather than a fixed doctrine.

# Chapter One
* This chapter engages with previous research and justifies the methodologies employed.

## Chapter 1




## Introduction
* Research into early Buddhism suggests that communicating freedom from suffering was central to the Buddha's teaching.
* The Buddha's aim was pedagogical rather than ontological.
* Close readings of Pāli texts show the importance of understanding the context of the addressee and prevalent Indian spiritual traditions for interpreting his teachings.

## 1.1 Aim And Scope Of This Research
* This thesis argues that analyzing the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal teachings through textual genres reveals a pedagogical pragmatism in relation to specific students.
* The research aims to investigate the Eighth Karmapa's life and selected Great Seal teachings, examining how he lived, studied, and taught it.
* It focuses on particular textual genres like spiritual biographies, question-and-answer texts, meditation instructions, esoteric precepts, and advice.
* The study examines selected instances from these genres in detailed case studies, contextualizing the Great Seal teaching and the Karmapa's interpretations.
* This thesis is not primarily a philosophical or doctrinal study but an attempt to cover new ground in researching the Eighth Karmapa's life and writings. 




## 1.2 Methodologies Employed

* Scholars in Buddhist Studies are increasingly debating their methodologies, influenced by the 'linguistic turn' in humanities.
* This thesis utilizes a combination of philological, historical, and phenomenological approaches to understand Tibetan Buddhist texts.
* It emphasizes an "ad hoc hermeneutics" approach, aiming to interpret religious traditions on their own terms, both sympathetically and critically.

## Textual Hermeneutics

* The thesis adopts an emic reading of texts and practices, attempting to understand them using categories and terms employed by the tradition.
* This involves a combination of translation, historical contextualization, and doctrinal analysis.
* While striving for an emic understanding, the research also maintains a critical awareness and acknowledges the limitations of any interpretive approach.

## Case Study Approach

* The thesis examines the Great Seal teachings of the Eighth Karmapa through case studies focused on specific students.
* This approach allows for a detailed exploration of the teachings in their historical, doctrinal, and literary contexts.

## Genre and Narratology

* The genre of spiritual biographies (*rnam thar*) is examined using tools from narratology to understand its religious function.
* This approach aims to enrich the analysis by considering the narrative structure and elements within these texts.


## Collaboration with Tibetan Scholars

* Occasional consultation with Tibetan scholars enhances understanding, particularly regarding the contemporary reception and use of the texts.
* The research acknowledges the complexities of the insider/outsider problem in Tibetan Studies and seeks a balanced approach that recognizes both emic and etic perspectives.

## 1.3 Previous Research On The Life And Works Of The Eighth Karmapa

* Limited scholarship exists on the Eighth Karmapa's life and works, despite his significance in Tibetan Buddhism.
* Prior research did not fully utilize the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*, published between 2000 and 2004.
* Gregor Verhufen's Master's thesis (1995) is the most comprehensive study on the Eighth Karmapa's life, focusing on his relationship with his teacher Sangs rgyas mnyan pa.

* Verhufen relied primarily on older Tibetan sources and did not include the *mKhas pa'i dga' ston* or spiritual biographies from the *Collected Works*.
* Hugh Richardson briefly mentions the Eighth Karmapa in "The Karmapa Sect: A Historical Note," focusing on his relationship with the Chinese Emperor Wu-tsung.

* Nick Douglas and Meryl White provide a basic overview of the Eighth Karmapa's life in *Black Hat Lama*, while Karma Thinley offers a more extensive summary in *The Sixteen Karmapas of Tibet*.
* Both works lack critical analysis and source citations, relying on traditional Tibetan sources.

## Academic Literature on the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal

* Research on the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal is inadequate.
* Samten G. Karmay (1988) uses the Eighth Karmapa's writings to discuss his polemics against the rNying ma pa, but does not focus on the Great Seal itself.
* Paul Williams (1983a, 1983b) and David Seyfort Ruegg (1988) examine the Eighth Karmapa's views on Madhyamaka based on his commentary *Dwags brgyud grub pa'i shing rta*.

* Williams highlights the Karmapa's critique of dGe lugs pa Madhyamaka, while Ruegg emphasizes the importance of Maitrīpa in bKa' brgyud pa lineage.
* This thesis aims to address the gaps in existing research by providing a more comprehensive analysis of the Eighth Karmapa's life, works, and Great Seal teachings.

##  Existing Research on the Eighth Karmapa

* **Early Studies:**
    * David Ruegg (1988) examined the Eighth Karmapa's shift from *gzhan stong* to *rang stong* interpretations of Madhyamaka, a view questioned and enhanced in this research.
    * Donald S. Lopez (1996) briefly mentioned the Eighth Karmapa's polemical responses to critics of Tsong kha pa's Madhyamaka position.

* **Studies Focusing on Madhyamaka:**
    * Cyrus Stearns (1999) utilized the Eighth Karmapa's *gZhan stong legs par smra ba'i sgron me* for his account of *gzhan stong* traditions in Tibet.
    * Karl Brunnhölzl (2004) examined the Madhyamaka interpretation of the bKa' brgyud pa, including scattered remarks on the Karmapa's Great Seal interpretation. He summarized the introduction of Dwags brgyud grub pa'i shing rta and attempted to reconcile Tibetan disputes on *rang stong* and *gzhan stong* in light of Indian sources using the Karmapa's comments.

* **Studies Focusing on Great Seal:**
    * Martina Draszczyk and David Higgins (2016) discussed four Tibetan scholars' views of the Great Seal, including the Eighth Karmapa, in their book *Mahāmudrā and the Middle Way*. They drew upon this book's prior thesis version for historical context.

* **Other Studies:**
    * Klaus-Diether Mathes (2008) drew upon the Eighth Karmapa's *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* commentary, demonstrating similarities between his *gzhan stong* and that of the Third Karmapa.
    * Limited mentions of the Eighth Karmapa can be found in works by Kapstein (1989), Martin (1997), Jackson (1994), Schaeffer (1998), Ruegg (2000), Braitstein (2004), and Phuntsho (2005).

## Translations of the Eighth Karmapa's Works

* **Limited Translations:** A small number of the Eighth Karmapa's writings have been translated, often in non-scholarly publications.
* **Examples:**
    * Glenn Mullin translated the Karmapa's praise of Tsong kha pa in *Four Songs to Je Rinpoche*.
    * The Nālandā Translation Committee published translations of Tibetan poetry (*mgur*) and a short invocation entitled 'Fulfilling the Aspirations of Gyalwang Karmapa'.
    * The Nitartha Institute translated the sixth chapter of *Dwags brgyud grub pa'i shing rta*.
    * Karl Brunnhölzl (2007) included a translation of the Eighth Karmapa's comment on a song by Milarepa in *Straight from the Heart*.

## Gaps in Research


* **Limited Academic Work:** While some translations and transcribed teachings are available, academic work on the Great Seal is scarce.
* **Need for Historical Studies:** There is a lack of historical studies on the Eighth Karmapa's life.
* **Focus on Doctrinal Developments:** Research has concentrated on analyzing concepts and doctrinal developments rather than exploring the broader context of his teachings.
* **Question and Answer Texts:** The prevalence of question and answer texts as sources for Great Seal material requires further examination.

## 1.4 Plan Of This Book

* Chapter One presented the main argument and related research questions. It explained the methodologies applied and discusses the relevance of previous research.
* Chapter Two introduces the doctrinal and historical contexts through the Great Seal distinctions of Kong sprul (1813–1899), and explains key points of the bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal and sGam po pa. 
* It outlines the Great Seal critique of Sa skya Paṇḍita, which became the subject of many medieval bKa' brgyud pa apologetics and explains the tense religio-political conditions the Eighth Karmapa was confronted with. 
* Chapter Three critically evaluates the main textual sources and genres employed.
* It briefly surveys the main sources for the Great Seal analysis: question and answer texts (*dris lan*), meditation instructions (*khrid*), esoteric precepts (*man ngag*), and advices (*bslab bya*).
* It also discusses the earliest spiritual biographies and spiritual memoirs most suitable for an analysis of the Eighth Karmapa's life. 
* Chapter Four examines how the Eighth Karmapa became one of the most prominent scholars and mystical teachers of his tradition.
* It explores how a rival candidate for the title of Karmapa, and the problematic religiopolitical situation resulting, may have reinforced his intellectual development.
* It examines his education in both scholastic and mystic teachings, and portrays his involvement and scepticism of contemporary worldly activeties.
* Finally, it outlines his Great Seal instructions within his overall programme of meditation teaching that stressed Atiśa's graded path. 
* Chapter Five investigates concrete teaching situations through three case studies: dialogues embedded in the spiritual biography by A khu a khra, the Gling drung pa la 'dor ba'i dris lan (Answer to a Question Asked by Gling drung pa La 'dor ba) and the *Phyag rgya chen po'i byin rlabs kyi ngos 'dzin*
(*Identification of the Blessing of the Great Seal*).
* It illustrates key points and divergent expressions of the Great Seal and how these were taught, depending on different circumstances and contexts. 
* Chapter Six further examines the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructtions in a broader context; taking into account passages from additional meditation instructions and question and answer texts.
* The chapter establishes the guru as the common origin, means, and unifying spiritual element of Great Seal practices of any approach, suggesting that an essential instruction is, according to circumstance, taught via either tantric or non-tantric means. 
* Chapter Seven concludes by advocating Great Seal instructions as pedagogical devices in which categorisation is subordinated to experience and realisation.

## 2. The Great Seal And 15Th To 16Th Century Tibet

### 2.1 The Great Seal

* The Marpa bKa' brgyud and later Dwags po bKa' brgyud (the lineages which passed through sGam po pa) are meditative traditions whose essential practices comprise the Great Seal and the six doctrines of Nāropa.
* In Tibet, there exist two transmissions that came to be known by the name 'bKa' brgyud': the Shangs pa bKa' brgyud and the Marpa bKa' brgyud which were passed through Marpa Lo tsā ba (c.1000–c.1081).
* The connection to the teacher is particularly significant in the meditative traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, and all masters equally emphasise the importance of a teacher for attaining realisation.

### 2.1.1 The Bka' Brgyud Pa Great Seal: A Brief Overview

* A brief presentation of a later bKa' brgyud master, Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas (1813–1899), may aid an initial survey: he distinguished a generally accepted mantra Great Seal, a sūtra Great Seal, and an essence Great Seal.
* Mantra Great Seal involves receiving tantric empowerment from one's guru and subsequent training in the two stages of meditation.
* Sūtra Great Seal is defined by its connection to the *pāramitāyāna*, being in accord with tantra, and focusing on the pith instruction of not becoming mentally engaged (*amanasikāra*) on the basis of sūtra teachings and practices.
* Essence Great Seal constitutes the sudden realisation of one's 'natural mind' (*tha mal gyi shes pa*), which is the perfection inherent (Skt*. sahaja*, Tib. *lhan cig skye pa*) in any experience: after being pointed out (*ngo sprod*) by a qualified teacher, a practitioner of high capacity experiences the essence of mind directly.
* These teachings are often linked to the *dohā* literature of Saraha and the teaching-cycles attributed to Maitrīpa.

## 2.1.2 Sgam Po Pa, Early Bka' Brgyud Pa, And The First Karmapa

* sGam po pa is a crucial figure for studying Tibet's bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal traditions.
* He united the monastic bKa' gdams pa with Marpa and Mi la ras pa's tantric bKa' brgyud pa.
* sGam po pa distinguished three paths: sūtra, mantra, and Great Seal.
* The novelty of his teaching was considering the path of direct perception self-sufficient and accessible without prior tantric empowerment.

## 2.1.3 Sa Skya Paṇḍita, Indian Great Seal, And Later Systematisations

* In the thirteenth century, Sa skya Paṇḍita critiqued the bKa' brgyud pa Great Seal teachings.
* He argued that a single method was insufficient for enlightenment and that the Great Seal should be taught within a tantric context.
* The bKa' brgyud traditions defended sGam po pa's teaching, citing Indian origins in the works of Jñānakīrti, Maitrīpa, and Saraha.
* Later masters like 'Gos Lo tsā ba and Karma 'phrin las pa emphasized Maitrīpa as a key figure in Great Seal teachings.
* The bKa' brgyud pa tradition continued to develop through commentaries, apologetics, and systematizations of early Tibetan and Indian masters.

## 2.2 Tibet From The Fifteenth To Sixteenth Centuries: Conflicts Between Dbus And Gtsang

* Political situation marked by tension between Phag mo gru pa of dBus and gTsang-based Rin spungs pa.
* Karma bKa' brgyud pa enjoyed support from Rin spungs pa, peaking during the Eighth Karmapa's early life (1498-1517).
* Tai Si tu Byang chub rgyal mtshan ended Sa skya pas' dominance under Mongol patronage in 1354.
* Phag mo gru pa initially supported bKa' brgyud pa but later became strong supporters of Tsong kha pa and his dGe lugs pa school.
* Tsong kha pa significantly impacted Tibetan Buddhism, leading to an era of scholasticism.
* Rin spungs pa gradually gained power in dBus, culminating in control by 1498.
* Fourth Zhwa dmar pa played a crucial role, maintaining ties with both Phag mo gru pa and Rin spungs pa.

## Chapter 3: Textual Sources For The Eighth Karmapa'S Life And Great Seal

* Focuses on analyzing the main sources for understanding the Eighth Karmapa's life and teachings.
* Investigates the history of the Karmapa's writings and examines the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*.
* Selects and evaluates textual sources used in the thesis, identifying closest possible witnesses.
* Explains the suitability of chosen genres for the study. 




## 3.1. History Of The Eighth Karmapa'S Writings

* Hand copying and block-printing were common methods of Tibetan literary production.
* Block-printing became widespread in Tibet by the late fifteenth century, requiring funding from wealthy patrons or influential lamas.
* In the bKa' brgyud tradition, printing was established by figures like gTsang smyon He ru ka and monasteries like Dwags lha sgam po.

* The first edition of the Eighth Karmapa's writings was a manuscript compilation around 1555, soon after his death in 1554.
* Key contributors to this compilation were the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa dKon mchog yan lag and dPa' bo gtsug lag 'phreng ba.
* The Fifth Zhwa dmar pa received instructions from the Eighth Karmapa and compiled a table of contents for his works, which is valuable for verifying their authenticity.

* A golden manuscript of the Eighth Karmapa's writings, comprising thirty volumes, was created under the patronage of Chos mdzad ma rNam grol shortly after his death.
* The Fifth Zhwa dmar pa likely oversaw the production of this manuscript and early ink manuscripts.

* It is hypothesized that a larger block-printed edition of the Eighth Karmapa's works was produced between 1554 and 1583, potentially under the supervision of the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa.
* Evidence supporting this includes similarities between a block print of the First Karma 'phrin las pa's biography and other sixteenth-century prints.

* Prints from this period are rare, lending credence to the oral history that printing the Eighth Karmapa's works was banned or restricted after 1642 under the Fifth Dalai Lama.
* Blocks of his collected works were found in a dGe lugs monastery near Lhasa, suggesting they may have been stored there after the ban.

* Thirteen volumes of manuscripts derived from the gTsang palace and later returned to Tibet offer further evidence of the Eighth Karmapa's writings.

* During the non-sectarian movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars at dPal spungs carved new blocks for some of his works, but only parts were printed.
* The history of the Eighth Karmapa's literary works remains speculative, but a relatively accurate record is available due to the early manuscript compilation and title lists.

## 3.2 The Collected Works Of The Eighth Karmapa 2000–2004: Origins And Rubrics

* The *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa* consists of twenty-six volumes containing newly discovered texts digitally inputted in Tibetan script.
* Funding for the compilation, editing, and printing was provided by the Tsadra Foundation.
* Sources for the texts include manuscripts from 'Bras spungs monastery, the Potala, the Nationalities Palace in Beijing, dPal spungs, and other locations.

* The editors used the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's table of contents to arrange the collection.
* Some texts were reprinted by the Sixteenth Karmapa in India.
* A Kālacakra commentary was printed in woodblocks in Karma bshad sgrub gling.
* Additional texts not mentioned in the Fifth Zhwa dmar pa's table of contents were discovered, including some potentially written by the Eighth Karmapa himself.

## Rubrics

* The Fifth Zhwa dmar pa divided *dKar chag* into six sections: spiritual biographies and vajra-songs, letters, praises, questions and answers, advices, and prayers, extensive commentaries on sutras and mantras, rituals and sādhanas for attaining the vajra-body, meditation instructions, and common sciences.
* The *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa* contains approximately three hundred texts, with some titles subsumed under one entry.
* Fifty-two works are presently missing from the collection.

* Missing texts include parts of the letter and praise sections, shorter commentaries, a disputational text, Kālacakra, Cakrasaṃvara, and cutting practices rituals, and grammatical treatises.

## Chapter 5 Case Studies Of The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal

* This chapter examines how the Eighth Karmapa taught the Great Seal to specific students through case studies.
* It analyzes instruction texts from various genres like dialogues, question-and-answer texts, and meditation instructions.
* The selection criteria for these texts include content, religious function, form, and intended audience.

## 5.1 Case Studies: Concrete Examples Of Teaching The Great Seal

* The case studies focus on texts teaching Great Seal meditation addressed to a particular person or group with specific questions about the practice.
* They analyze works from three genres: dialogues in spiritual biographies, question-and-answer texts, and meditation instructions.
* The main analytical rubrics include historical context, doctrinal content, and the relationship between instruction and addressee.

## 5.2 Dialogues In A Khu A Khra'S Spiritual Biography6

* Dialogues are scarce in the Eighth Karmapa's spiritual biographies.
* *A khu A khra* contains clearly quoted dialogues centered on the Great Seal, representing early textual witnesses of his teachings.

## 5.2.1 Their Function In The Main Narrative

* Dialogues in *A khu A khra* are not question and answer texts but two-way communications between the Eighth Karmapa and a student about Buddhist teaching.
* They were likely orally conducted before being written down.
* Dialogues differ from question and answer texts and can be understood as embedded non-narrative texts within the main narrative.

* The narrator of the main narrative is heterodiegetic (outside the world of the narrative) and extradiegetic (talks to the reader).
*  The dialogues are placed after the Karmapa's enthronement, a major plot point in the story of an incarnate Lama.
* The narrative surrounding the dialogues focuses on the topoi of education, enlightened deeds, and demonstration of spiritual abilities.

* A likely function of the embedded dialogues is to show the Karmapa's abilities as a realised teacher.

## 5.2.2 Dialogue With A Khu A Khra

* The first dialogue takes place between the Eighth Karmapa and A khu a khra, the author of the biography.
* It occurs at the monastery of sDe steng in 1513.
* The setting shifts from official to private, implying closeness between the Karmapa and A khu a khra.

*  The narrator shifts from heterodiegetic/extradiegetic to homodiegetic/intradiegetic when introducing the dialogue.
* Doctrinally, the dialogue centres on the Great Seal teaching that conceptualisation is the *dharmakāya*.

* A khu a khra objects, using concepts from Abhidharma metaphysics.
* The Karmapa responds strongly, suggesting a close guru-disciple relationship.

* He argues that appearances are mind and challenges A khu a khra to bring him a *dharmakāya* different from thoughts.
* This pedagogical method resembles pointing out (*ngo sprod*) the mind.




## 5.2.3 Dialogue With Rgya Ston Nang So Seng Ge Ba

* The dialogue revolves around the concept of "ordinary mind" (*tha mal gyi shes pa*), a key term in the Great Seal tradition.
* The Karmapa explains that conceptualization is the essence of *dharmakāya*, and that conceptualization and timeless awareness are undifferentiated aspects of the ordinary mind.
* He uses similes like grains, stones, and empty space to illustrate the all-encompassing nature of the ordinary mind.
* The Karmapa emphasizes that there is no need to cultivate the ordinary mind for advanced practitioners as it is already present.

## 5.2.4 Dialogue With Dga' Ldan Dbon Po Nam Mkha' Rgyal Mtshan

* This dialogue focuses on meditation and the role of concepts in practice.
* The Karmapa advises meditating "like space," emphasizing that concepts themselves are like space.
* He discourages giving up concepts through non-conceptualization, stating that it hinders realization.
* The Karmapa suggests understanding concepts as *dharmakāya* to achieve progress on the path of Nāropa's teachings.

## 5.2.5 Dialogue With Mi Nyag Skya Ging Bya Bral Ba

* This dialogue addresses obstacles in meditation and the importance of recognizing the essence of conceptualization.
* The Karmapa advises removing obstacles through the essence of conceptualization and cautions against harboring hope for results.
* He uses the metaphor of a dog's hair and Buddha's light rays to illustrate the unity of ordinary phenomena with enlightenment.
* The Karmapa concludes by demonstrating that even a single hair can represent the three bodies of a Buddha.

## 5.2.6 Conceptualisation And Dharmakāya

* The dialogues embedded within the narrative aim to portray the Eighth Karmapa as a realised teacher, particularly in the context of Great Seal teachings.
* These dialogues likely stem from early interactions with the young Karmapa, possibly witnessed and recorded by A khu a khra, his former secretary.
* While the exact historical accuracy is uncertain, the doctrinal content suggests a coherent layer of instruction on the nature of mind as *dharmakāya*.

## 5.3 Answer To Gling Drung Pa'S Query On The Great Seal

* This text is a written exchange between the Eighth Karmapa and Gling drung A mdong pa, addressing doctrinal issues related to Sa skya Paṇḍita's criticism and the distinction between tantra and the Great Seal.
* While the exact context remains unclear, it is likely that Gling drung A mdong pa was a relative of other Gling drung pas mentioned in spiritual biographies, who were already devoted to the Ngor pa tradition.

## 5.3.1 The Addressee And Other Contexts

* The *Answer to Gling drung pa* was probably written after 1546, suggesting a period when the Eighth Karmapa was at his peak of scholarship and teaching.
* Although not listed among the Karmapa's closest students, Gling drung A mdong pa likely received teachings from both Sa skya pa and Ngor pa traditions and considered the Eighth Karmapa as his teacher.

## 5.3.2 The Content

* This section discusses the differences between the fourth empowerment as understood by the Sa skya pas and the Great Seal as taught by the bKa' brgyud tradition.

* The Karmapa explains that there are two types of empowerments: mundane and supramundane.
* He argues that only the supramundane empowerments from the Kālacakra tantra lead to the ultimate goal, the 'pervading Vajrasattva'.

* The Karmapa then introduces the Great Seal of the bKa' brgyud tradition as taught by sGam po pa. 
* He distinguishes it from both mundane and supramundane empowerments, emphasizing its focus on immediate realization through resting in the mind's true nature.

* The Karmapa criticizes ritualistic practices associated with tantric empowerments, contrasting them with the simplicity of the Great Seal.

* A story is recounted about Phag mo gru pa, who initially received the fourth empowerment from the Sa skya pas but later embraced the Great Seal of sGam po pa.
* This story suggests that the Karmapa may consider the Great Seal to be superior to the Sa skya pa's fourth empowerment.




## 5.3.3 The Story Of Sbas Mchod: Pedagogy, History, And The Great Seal

* This section examines the story of sGam po pa's precepts being more profound to Phag mo gru pa than anything he had practised before, a well-known rhetoric in bKa' brgyud pa spiritual biographies.
* It investigates the historical figure of Khams pa sBas mchod and attempts to locate the Karmapa's alleged source for this story, a text by Phag mo gru pa.
* The section explores Phag mo gru pa's connection to Sa skya tradition and his learning of *lam 'bras* instructions from Sa chen Kun dga' snying po.
* It analyzes the figure of Khams pa sBas mchod surfacing in bKa' brgyud pa spiritual biographies and his relationship with Phag mo gru pa.
* The section discusses the search for the Eighth Karmapa's alleged source, *Phyag chen lhan cig skyes sbyor gnang ba*, and its absence from published versions of Phag mo gru pa's collected writings (*bka' 'bum*).

## 5.3.4 Great Seal Beyond Tantra

* This section analyzes a question-and-answer text that sheds light on how the Eighth Karmapa approached a polemically loaded Great Seal question from a student with likely Ngor pa and Sa skya background.
* It explores the religious and political circumstances surrounding this exchange, highlighting the ambivalence of the enquirer and the sectarian nature of the anecdote used by the Karmapa.
* The section analyzes the Karmapa's doctrinal explanation, distinguishing tantras into mundane and supramundane and presenting the Great Seal as a teaching that transcends tantric ritual.
* It compares the Karmapa's teaching style in this text to his dialogues depicted earlier, noting its emphasis on letting mind rest without effort (*ma bcos*).

## 5.4 Identifying The Blessing: A Mantra Path


* This section focuses on the *Phyag rgya chen po'i byin rlabs kyi ngos 'dzin*, a text from the Eighth Karmapa's Collected Works, which emphasizes the importance of blessing (*byin rlabs*) for Great Seal practice.
* It outlines the Karmapa's view on receiving the blessing, connecting it to the tantric path of union of clarity and emptiness, union of the two accumulations, and union of the two buddha-bodies.
* The section describes the Karmapa's explanation of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* meditations as preliminary practices for the Great Seal path.
* It highlights the Karmapa's emphasis on the complete practice of Vajrayāna, including receiving empowerments and practicing tantric meditation, to achieve the highest accomplishment (*siddhi*) of the Great Seal.



## Contextualising The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal Instructions

* This chapter analyzes key ideas from previous case studies and addresses divergent interpretations found within them.
* It aims to isolate doctrinal elements common to the investigated Great Seal teachings.
* It focuses on the teacher as a crucial religious origin and means of instruction, investigating the function of confidence (*dad pa*) and devotion (*mos gus*) in some Great Seal instructions of the Eighth Karmapa.

## 6.1 Basic Distinctions Of The Great Seal

* The Eighth Karmapa maintains that Great Seal instructions originate from Saraha.
* Saraha expounded on the Great Seal from the perspective of affirmation, while his student Nāgārjuna taught from negation.
* The Karmapa stresses Maitrīpa's approaches as crucial for the Great Seal.
* According to the Karmapa, Maitrīpa's understanding of Madhyamaka included the teachings of Saraha the elder and younger along with Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti.

## 6.2 Interpretations Of Conceptualisation As Dharmakāya

* The chapter explains how the key doctrine from Chapter Five dialogues is explained in further sources.
* It focuses on the much-debated second approach (ii), which sGam po pa taught frequently, labeled 'Great Seal'.
* Understanding such a Madhyamaka/ Great Seal as explained by sGam po pa would be called 'actualising the ordinary mind' (*tha mal gyi shes pa mngon du mdzad*) or 'directly realising the *dharmakāya*' (*chos sku mngon sum du byas*).
* The chapter presents the Eighth Karmapa's reception of the Third Karmapa's and 'Bri gung pa's doctrines.
* It emphasizes that conceptualisation arises as *dharmakāya* is a mere designation.
* The text explores how the impure aspect of mind comes about, highlighting the concepts of Buddha nature, pure and impure phases, and the obscuration by ignorance.
* Despite specific terminology, the pith instruction boils down to a point similar to the answer to Gling drung pa.
* The chapter discusses the distinction between scholastic explications and more direct instructions, using Shel brags Bla ma Chos kyi rgyal mtshan's question as an example.
* It concludes that the Karmapa considers his approach specifically meditation oriented.

## 6.3 Common Strands And Divergent Interpretations


* The Eighth Karmapa distinguishes between tantric and non-tantric interpretations of the Great Seal (*Mahamudra*) meditation practice.
* He emphasizes its importance in removing subtle clinging and conceptualization during meditation, particularly when experiencing bliss and emptiness in tantric practices.

* The Karmapa uses examples like Phag mo gru pa's experience to illustrate how even with initial experiences of bliss, further instruction is needed for complete realization.

* He acknowledges the possibility of teaching Great Seal directly without tantric empowerment, though he recognizes its origin within tantric traditions.
* The Karmapa distinguishes between sGam po pa's approach (derived from Maitrīpa) and Atiśa's sūtra-based Great Seal.

* He highlights the danger of deviating from emptiness (*shunyata*) in some interpretations of Great Seal.

* In response to a question, the Karmapa defines Great Seal as tantric, aligning with Sa skya Paṇḍita's view.
* The Eighth Karmapa blends sūtra and tantra, emphasizing *amanasikāramadhyamaka*, and highlights the lineage of Saraha, Maitrīpa, sGam po pa, and the Third Karmapa.

* He acknowledges a "Great Seal" practice focused on sūtra-Madhyamaka, as emphasized by sGam po pa, but differentiates it from Atiśa's system.
* The Karmapa suggests an "essence Great Seal" that transcends categorization and is key for overcoming clinging and conceptualization.

* This interpretation aligns with contemporary views of bKra shis rnam rgyal, who sees Great Seal as an independent path potentially linked to tantra or sūtras.
* The Karmapa's classification of tantras into mundane and supramundane lends credibility to this source.
* The guru-disciple relationship plays a significant role in shaping the teaching and understanding of Great Seal.




## 6.4 The Guru As Origin And Example In Vajrayāna And Great Seal Traditions

* The guru is central in Vajrayāna and considered an embodiment of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.
* The guru is the source of empowerment and instruction, crucial for spiritual development.
* In Great Seal traditions, meditation on the teacher is often a key practice.
* The Eighth Karmapa emphasized the importance of the guru's blessing and guidance for attaining Buddhahood.

##  

* The guru transmits the meaning of Great Seal teachings, both orally and in writing.
* The Karmapa saw himself as an example to be followed by his students.
* The teacher's authenticity is based on lineage, power (blessing), and personal realization. 




## 6.5 The Guru As Means In The Eighth Karmapa'S Great Seal Instructions

* This section examines the role of the teacher as both a means and goal of realization in the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructions that don't explicitly involve tantric practices.
* The text emphasizes the importance of "opening up" or invoking (*gsol 'debs*) the guru, which is considered essential for realizing all paths.

*  The Karmapa defines *gsol 'debs* as constantly focusing one's body, speech, and mind on the teacher, rather than invoking them at specific times.
* The practice of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* meditation is connected to contemplating one's teacher.

* The Karmapa emphasizes that in the bKa' brgyud tradition, one should not over-analyze conventionally but rest the mind in a way suitable for Great Seal awareness to arise.
* This can be achieved by invoking an authentic teacher who embodies the essence of all Buddhas and whose blessing enters the student's mind.

* The Karmapa connects this path of blessing with the bKa' brgyud lineage, distinguishing it from the Vajrayāna path.
* Both *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* meditation are explained in detail, with the lama serving as a means for cultivating profound absorption (*samādhi*) and its qualities (joy, clarity, non-conceptuality).

* Making the face of the lama an object of mind is considered a skillful means for one-pointedness.
* Vipaśyanā involves contemplating essencelessness and settling the mind on all aspects of mental formations.

* The text emphasizes the crucial role of devotion (*mos gus*) as both a prerequisite and part of the actual practice.

* Devotion, enhanced by *gsol 'debs*, helps concentrate the mind and bring it to a state where conceptual states fade and power enters the mind stream.
* Other instructions highlight the importance of "confidence" (*dad pa*) in the teacher, which is seen as essential for realizing the Great Seal.




## Chapter 7

* The aim was to explore the Eighth Karmapa's life and writings, analyzing how he taught the Great Seal in specific contexts and textual genres.
* A solid foundation for this thesis and future research was laid through critical evaluation of Tibetan sources contained in the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa*.
* Material from three early spiritual biographies was investigated to construct a more complete portrait of the Eighth Karmapa's life.
* The Eighth Karmapa can be considered the most significant scholar of the Karmapa lineage besides the Third Karmapa.

## Conclusions

* This thesis explored the Eighth Karmapa's life and writings, analyzing how he taught the Great Seal in specific contexts and textual genres.
* Critical evaluation of Tibetan sources contained in the *Collected Works of the Eighth Karmapa* laid a foundation for this thesis and future research.
* Material from three early spiritual biographies was investigated to construct a more complete portrait of the Eighth Karmapa's life.
* The Eighth Karmapa can be considered the most significant scholar of the Karmapa lineage besides the Third Karmapa.

* The Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal instructions reveal the radical rhetoric of immediacy typical of Great Seal traditions.
* Three facets have become evident in the Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal interpretations: instruction for understanding conceptualisation's true nature as Buddhahood, different approaches to this instruction, and the common origin of these instructions in the guru.

* The Eighth Karmapa's Great Seal is better understood as an adaptable and flexible pragmatic device, where experience is conceived of as superior to claims of ultimate truth.
* Great Seal instructions may be viewed as skilful means, analogous to the famed Mahāyāna concept of *upāya-kauśalya*.
* This thesis is a first step towards an examination of the complex sources, personalities, and transmissions present in the writings of the Eighth Karmapa.
