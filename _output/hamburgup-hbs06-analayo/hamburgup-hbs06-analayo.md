# 1 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī In The Nandakovāda

* This chapter uses the *Nandakovāda*-sutta and its parallels as a case study to illustrate attitudes towards nuns in early Buddhist narratives.
*  Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the founder of the nuns' order, is the central figure in this analysis. 
* The chapter examines narrative strategies used in these texts, focusing on how nuns are portrayed in relation to the Buddha and monks.
* Specific versions of the *Nandakovāda* considered include those found in the Majjhima-*nikāya*, Saṃyukta-*āgama*, Sanskrit fragments, and Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*. 




## 1.1 The Introductory Narrative

* Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and five hundred nuns approach the Buddha requesting him to teach them.
* It is Nandaka's turn to teach the nuns, but he does not wish to do so.
* The Buddha instructs Ānanda to find out whose turn it is to teach the nuns.
*  Ānanda informs the Buddha that it is Nandaka's turn.
* The Buddha then instructs Nandaka to teach the nuns. 



# The Buddha and the Nuns

* In the Saṃyukta-*āgama* version, the Buddha emphasizes his old age as a reason for delegating teaching duties to monks.
* He presents teaching the nuns as an honorable task, akin to standing in his place.
* Nandaka's silence is interpreted as acknowledgment of his neglectful behavior.

# Contrasting Narratives: Saṃyukta-*āgama* vs. Majjhima-*nikāya*

* The Saṃyukta-*āgama* portrays the nuns with respect, highlighting their status as great disciples and emphasizing the Buddha's direct teachings to them.
* In contrast, the Majjhima-*nikāya* version presents a less flattering picture of the nuns, omitting their names and titles, and depicting the Buddha ignoring their request for teaching.

# Nandaka's Response and the Nuns' Reception

* The Saṃyukta-*āgama* portrays Nandaka accepting his duty silently, recognizing his lapse in responsibility.
* Conversely, the Majjhima-*nikāya* depicts Nandaka responding affirmatively, suggesting a lack of remorse for shirking his duty.
* The nuns' elaborate welcome of Nandaka, including setting out water for washing his feet, might imply an exaggerated level of respect, potentially elevating him to the status of the Buddha himself.

# Implications and Interpretations

* The differing narratives raise questions about the nuns' social standing and the perceived importance of their instruction.
* The contrasting portrayals of Nandaka highlight varying perspectives on monastic responsibility and accountability.
* The nuns' reception of Nandaka prompts reflection on the dynamics of power and respect within the Buddhist monastic community. 




## 1.2 The Attainments Of The Nuns

* The text discusses different accounts of the nuns' attainment after teachings by Nandaka.
* The Majjhima-nikāya version suggests the nuns reached various levels of awakening, with some only becoming stream-enterers after the second teaching.
* In contrast, the Saṃyukta-āgama and Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya versions state that all nuns achieved full awakening after the second teaching.

* This discrepancy is supported by Pāli commentaries on the Aṅguttara-nikāya, *Theragāthā*, and *Therīgāthā*.
* However, the Majjhima-nikāya commentary suggests some nuns only aspired to lower stages of awakening.

* The moon simile used by the Buddha may originally have signified full awakening for the nuns.
* The current presentation in the Nandakovāda-sutta* might be a later change that portrays the nuns less favorably.

## 1.3 Narrative Distancing

* The *Nandakovāda* illustrates a tendency in Theravāda texts to distance women, particularly nuns.
* This distancing is evident in the Pāli version of the discourse where a nun giving a profound teaching is not present when the Buddha praises her wisdom, unlike parallel versions.
* This trend also appears in later literature, such as the *Paññāsa-jātaka*, where the female protagonist does not directly communicate with the former Buddha, unlike parallels.

## 2 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Petition

* This chapter focuses on the foundation history of the nuns' order, using the story of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's petition for ordination as a case study.
* The chapter will examine various canonical versions of this story.
* It will analyze Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's request for ordination, the Buddha's refusal, and her reaction to his refusal. 




## 2.1 The Main Versions Of The Foundation History

* Seven main discourse and *Vinaya* versions are discussed: Dharmaguptaka *Vinaya*, Haimavata *Vinayamātṛkā*, Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda *Vinaya*, Mahīśāsaka *Vinaya*, Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*, Sarvāstivāda discourse, and Theravāda *Vinaya*.
* Versions of the foundation history are found not only in *Vinayas*, but also in discourse literature.
* The foundation history is basically a *Vinaya* narrative that needs to be understood in terms of its teaching function in monastic education.

## 2.2 The Initial Request

* Seven canonical versions agree that the initial request took place in the Buddha's home country, among the Śākyans.
* The Mahīśāsaka version provides additional detail, including a story about King Śuddhodana requesting ordination and being denied.
* Most accounts report that Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī was accompanied by five hundred Śākyan women when she made her request.

* Different versions present variations in the wording of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's request, but a common theme is the desire to progress on the path to awakening.
* The Mūlasarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda versions explicitly ask if women can attain the fourth fruit of recluseship (arhatship).

## 2.3 The Buddha'S Refusal

* The Buddha refuses Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's request for women to join the monastic order, citing concerns about the longevity of his teachings.
* Different Buddhist schools offer variations on this refusal, with some suggesting that past Buddhas also prohibited women from ordination.
* Some versions suggest alternative practices for women, such as shaving their heads, wearing robes, and living celibate lives at home.

## 2.4 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Reaction

* The number of times Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī repeats her request varies across different Buddhist texts.
* Some versions depict her persisting even after three refusals, highlighting a strong desire for women to join the monastic order.
* This persistence contrasts with the eventual acceptance of her request by the Buddha, suggesting potential revisions in the narrative over time.
* The Buddha's suggestion of alternative practices for women, such as shaving their heads and wearing robes while staying at home, is mentioned in some versions. 




## Dharmaguptaka:

* Mahāprajāpatī heard that the Buddha was staying at Jetavana and, along with five hundred Śākyan women, shaved their heads, donned robes, and went to see him. 
* Different Buddhist traditions offer varying accounts of how this came about.

## 3 Ānanda'S Intervention

* This section focuses on Ānanda's role in persuading the Buddha to establish an order of nuns.
* It examines two key episodes: Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's encounter with Ānanda and a separate incident from the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta where Ānanda intervenes on her behalf.
* The arguments Ānanda uses to convince the Buddha are analyzed, particularly his emphasis on women's capacity for enlightenment. 
* Finally, the narrative context behind Ānanda's role as a mediator is explored. 




## 3.1 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī And Ānanda

* The scene depicts Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's encounter with Ānanda after she follows the Buddha.
* She is described as being dusty and crying, signifying her connection to household life rather than monasticism.
* This portrayal contrasts with the Buddha's purity, suggesting a symbolic meaning behind her appearance.
* Ānanda notices her condition and learns of her desire for ordination.

* In some versions, he takes the initiative to speak to the Buddha on her behalf, while in others, she requests his help.
* Notably, most versions do not mention Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's shaved head and robes, suggesting that these actions were already permitted by the Buddha.
* The absence of censure for her monastic appearance supports the idea that the Buddha had previously given permission for this form of renunciation.

* This alternative perspective suggests that the Buddha initially allowed women to live a celibate life at home as a safer option.
* His eventual refusal to grant ordination might have been due to concerns about the challenging conditions of homeless monastic life for women in the early stages of Buddhism.

# 3.2 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Gift Of A Robe

* This section examines another instance where the Buddha refused a request from Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, this time regarding a robe donation.
* The story is found in various Buddhist texts, including the Majjhima-nikāya and its parallels.
* The relevance to the founding of the nuns' order lies in the motif of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī attempting to donate a robe, which appears in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya as part of the events leading up to her request for ordination.

* In the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga-sutta and its parallels, the Buddha consistently refuses Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's single robe offering.
*  The context suggests she might be a laywoman, but it could also imply she was already ordained as a nun.
* The mention of the nuns' order in this discourse further complicates her status.

* The episode highlights a contrast with the founding of the nuns' order: convincing the Buddha to accept a robe seems harder than persuading him to ordain women.
* The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya's inclusion of the robe offer in the foundation story suggests a possible influence from this episode on other versions.




## 3.3 Arguments Raised By Ānanda

* The arguments raised by Ānanda involve two main themes: the debt of gratitude and the potential of women to awaken.
* In most versions, Ānanda points out that Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī raised the Buddha with her own milk when his mother had passed away. 
* The Buddha clarifies that he has already settled his debt of gratitude to her.

*  The motif of the debt of gratitude is not found in all versions and seems like a later addition.

* The other theme broached by Ānanda is the potential of women to reach awakening.
* This argument is common to most versions, including the Theravāda discourse, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda accounts, and Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda account.

* In some versions, Ānanda raises the topic of the four assemblies as an argument for granting women ordination.
* He points out that all Buddhas had four assemblies: monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.

* The Haimavata (?) version only includes the argument about women's potential to awaken.





## 3.4 Women'S Potential For Awakening

* Early Buddhist texts state that women are just as capable as men of reaching awakening.
* A discourse in the Saṃyutta-*nikāya* and its Saṃyukta-*āgama* parallels affirm this principle.
* The Mahāvac*chagotta-sutta* mentions over five hundred nuns who attained arhatship.
* The *Therīgāthā* features accomplished nuns, including a group of thirty who achieved arhatship.

##  Māra's Challenge to Somā

* A discourse in the Saṃyutta-*nikāya* depicts Māra challenging the nun Somā about women's ability to reach awakening.
* This is the only instance in early discourses where this doubt is raised.
* Māra personifies external disturbances and prejudices against women pursuing monastic life.
* Somā confidently refutes Māra, affirming women's capacity for awakening.

## Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's Passing Away

* The Buddha asked Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī to perform supernormal feats to dispel doubts about women's ability to achieve full realization.
* Both Pāli and Ekottarika-*āgama* versions highlight her abilities.
* The Buddha showed respect for her by walking behind her bier and even participating in transporting her corpse (according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda version).

## Conclusion

* Early discourse passages support the idea of women's potential for awakening as a motivation for the Buddha to establish an order of nuns.
* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and her followers demonstrated their ability to endure monastic life, proving they didn't need to be confined to a semi-monastic existence at home. 




## 3.5 Ānanda'S Role

* The intervention by Ānanda is a common element in the different foundation histories of the nuns' order.
* Reports from Chinese pilgrims indicate that nuns regularly made offerings at *stūpa*s dedicated to Ānanda, showing the lasting influence of this narrative episode.
* There appears to be a chronological inconsistency regarding Ānanda's role as he is depicted as both a newly ordained monk and the Buddha's attendant during the event.

## 4 The Buddha'S Permission

* This chapter examines the depiction of the Buddha granting permission for women to become nuns, subject to eight conditions known as *gurudharma*s.
*  The chapter will analyze the simile used to illustrate the function of the *gurudharma*s.
* It will then explore *gurudharma*s related to communal transactions and those concerning homage and criticism. 




## 4.1 The Simile Of The Dyke

*  The simile of the dyke is used to illustrate the function of the Buddha's promulgation of the eight *gurudharma*s.
* Different versions of this simile exist in various Buddhist traditions, but the core idea remains consistent.
* The dyke symbolizes protection and the accumulation of spiritual power, enabling women to reach awakening.

*  The Dharmaguptaka and Haimavata (?) accounts use a bridge (or boat) simile instead, also signifying progress towards awakening.




## 4.2 The Gurudharmas On Communal Transactions

* Nearly all versions of Buddhist texts spell out eight conditions (*gurudharma*) for women to become nuns.
* These *gurudharma*s serve as the higher ordination for nuns in most versions.
* One *gurudharma* concerns the process of higher ordination itself, specifying that nuns should seek it from both communities (monks and nuns).

* Some versions mention a probationary period before higher ordination, which may have been added later to address issues like ordaining pregnant women.
* Two *gurudharma*s relate to monastic offences: undergoing penance (*mānatva*) and inviting critique (*pravāraṇā*).


* In some versions, these procedures should involve both communities, while others specify only the monks.

* Another two *gurudharma*s concern relationships between the orders: nuns observing the rainy season where monks are present and receiving fortnightly exhortation from monks.
* These *gurudharma*s likely originated as practical guidelines for a new order of nuns interacting with an established monastic community.

* The remaining *gurudharma*s appear to be aimed at subordinating nuns to monks. 




## 4.3 The Gurudharmas On Homage And Criticism

* This section outlines gurudharma regulations concerning respect shown to monks by nuns and restrictions on criticism between monks and nuns.

* All versions of the Vinaya agree that a nun should show respect to a monk, even if she is senior in ordination.
* Specific actions demonstrating respect include bowing with head at the feet, rising up, putting palms together, and preparing a seat for the monk.
* The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya emphasizes the need for "utmost humility" from nuns towards monks.

* A later passage in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya recounts Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī requesting that junior monks pay homage to senior nuns, but the Buddha rejects this request.
* Similar accounts are found in other Vinayas, suggesting these regulations arose after the order of nuns gained seniority.

* The Theravāda Vinaya also includes a request by Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī for reciprocal respect between monks and nuns, but the Buddha refuses, citing the practice of non-Buddhists who did not pay homage to women.
* Jain sources confirm this practice, indicating that Jain nuns should show respect to Jain monks regardless of seniority.

* Gurudharma regulations also address criticism between monks and nuns.

* Most Vinayas state that nuns are prohibited from criticizing monks, while monks are allowed to criticize nuns.
* This regulation is difficult to reconcile with other Vinaya passages where the Buddha takes action against monks based on criticisms made by nuns.

* The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya goes further, stating that nuns should not ask monks questions about Dharma teachings.
* These restrictions suggest later concerns about maintaining a hierarchical structure within the monastic community.

# 5 Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī'S Ordination

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī expresses joyful acceptance of the *gurudharma*s using a simile involving receiving a flower garland on her head.
* This simile appears with slight variations in detail across different versions of the foundation history.

# 5.1 The Simile Illustrating Acceptance

*  All versions depict Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī responding to Ānanda's announcement of the *gurudharma*s with a flower garland simile.
* Variations exist in the details of the simile across different versions.




## Dharmaguptaka:

* A clean and adorned person receives a head wreath of flowers from another person.
* They accept it and place it firmly on their head.

## Haimavata (?):

* A bathed, perfumed, and adorned person receives a flower wreath.

## Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda:

* A young person fond of ornaments, with washed hair and fresh clothes, receives a garland of flowers on their head.

## Mahīśāsaka:

* A spotless and joyful young man or woman, having bathed and dressed in new clothes, receives a head wreath of flowers.
* They joyfully accept it and place it upon their head.

## Mūlasarvāstivāda:

* A noblewoman who has bathed, applied fragrances, cleaned her hair, cut her nails, and dressed in fresh clothes receives a head wreath of flowers.
* She accepts it with great joy and places it on her head.

## Sarvāstivāda:

* A handsome and beautiful warrior girl, brahmin girl, householder girl, or worker-class girl, who has bathed, applied perfume, put on clean clothes, and adorned herself receives a head wreath of flowers.
* She accepts it with great joy and adorns her head with it.

## Theravāda:

* A youthful man or woman, with washed hair, receives a garland of lotuses or other flowers.
* They accept it with both hands and place it upon their head. 




## 5.2 Repercussions Of Female Renunciation

* All versions illustrate the problem related to instituting an order of nuns with one or several similes.
* Most versions place these similes as part of the Buddha's reply to Ānanda's intervention on behalf of Mahāprajā-patī Gautamī.
* The Theravāda version places them after the acceptance of the *gurudhar*-mas and after his foster mother has received ordination.

## Simile Analysis

* **Household with many women:** This simile is found in all versions except for the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda account.
    * It illustrates the need to protect nuns from sexual abuse, a common problem for women who were not protected by a husband in ancient India.
    * The Mūlasarvāstivāda and Theravāda versions link this simile with the danger of robbers, highlighting the vulnerability of women without male protection.

* **Farming Similes:** Several versions use similes comparing nuns to crops damaged by disease or weather calamities.
    * These likely originally conveyed a sense of the need for protection against external threats rather than depicting nuns as inherently destructive.
    * The Sarvāstivāda version's simile of weeds growing in a field stands out as potentially reflecting a later shift in perspective, viewing nuns as a threat from within.

## Simile Placement and Narrative Impact

* In most versions, the similes are placed in the Buddha's reply to Ānanda's intervention, illustrating the dangers faced by nuns.
* The Mahīśāsaka and Theravāda versions place the similes after Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī has already received ordination.
* This shift in placement, particularly in the Theravāda version, can be seen as emphasizing a negative perception of nuns as the source of danger rather than victims needing protection.

# That the nuns themselves were eventually perceived as the source of danger

* All versions of the text suggest that nuns were seen as dangerous.
* Similes comparing households or fields to ruined orders illustrate the negative consequences of having nuns.
* Different versions conclude that nuns will cause the Buddha's teachings to decline or disappear.

# When comparing these different descriptions

* The term "holy life" (*brahmacarya*) can refer to celibacy or the Buddha's teachings as a whole.
* The similes could originally have illustrated the need to protect nuns, allowing them to live celibate lives without being vulnerable to abuse.
* Alternatively, the similes could reflect fears that nuns would damage the reputation of Buddhism.

# The focus on such perceived negative repercussions becomes considerably more prominent in the Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sar-vāstivāda versions


* These versions depict the Buddha informing Ānanda about problems caused by nuns. 


## 5.3 Apprehensions

* The Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda versions express negative consequences of allowing women to become nuns.
* These versions suggest that without nuns, monks would have received more respect and offerings from lay people.
* Lay people would have gone to great lengths to show their respect for monks, even offering them their clothes and hair to walk on.
* The Sarvāstivāda version also claims that monks wouldn't have faced competition from other religious groups without nuns.

* These versions list five "impossibilities" for women: they cannot become heavenly rulers like Śakra, Māra, or Brahmā; they cannot be wheel-turning kings; and they cannot become Buddhas.
* This list reflects ancient Indian social hierarchy and the belief that men held higher positions of power.

* The listing of the five impossibilities seems out of place in the context of the foundation history of the order of nuns, suggesting a later addition fueled by negative sentiments towards women.

## 5.4 Other Instances Of Negativity

* Several discourses in the Aṅguttara-*nikāya* express negative attitudes towards women, including claims about their insatiable desire for sex and childbirth, inherent anger, envy, greed, and stupidity, and comparisons to black snakes due to their perceived dirtiness, smell, betrayal, and slander.
* These statements lack parallels in other Buddhist schools and contradict the positive image of nuns presented elsewhere.
* They also clash with Buddhist doctrine regarding the potential for female enlightenment and the evolution myth that suggests no inherent superiority of males over females.

## 6 Decline

* The foundation history predicts that the establishment of an order of nuns will halve the lifespan of the Buddha's dispensation.
* This prediction is contrasted with passages highlighting outstanding nuns and the importance of the four assemblies (monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen) as integral to the Buddha's teachings.
* Accusations against Ānanda for supporting the nuns during the first saṅ-*gīti* shed light on the context surrounding the prediction of decline in the foundation history. 




## 6.1 The Prediction Of Decline

* All versions of the founding story include a prediction that the Buddha's teachings will only last 500 years instead of 1000 because women were allowed to become nuns.
* The Dharmaguptaka version predicts decline three times, emphasizing the negative impact of ordaining women.
* The Mūlasarvāstivāda version also predicts a shortened duration twice, initially stating the teachings won't last long and later specifying the loss of 500 years.
* The Sarvāstivāda version has two predictions, one general and one specific to the reduced duration due to women's ordination.
* The Haimavata (?) account has a single prediction made before Ānanda informs the nuns about the conditions for their ordination.
* The Theravāda discourse also predicts a shortened lifespan of the teachings after Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī accepts the conditions for ordination.
* The Mahīśāsaka version attributes the founding of the order to Māra's influence on Ānanda, suggesting the Buddha was powerless to prevent it.

* This account attempts to explain why the Buddha allowed something detrimental, but it raises further questions about his ability to counter Māra. 
* The Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda version suggests the Buddha chose a shorter lifespan for his teachings to protect Ānanda from confusion and preserve his recitation of the discourses.



## 6.2 Outstanding Nuns

* The idea that founding an order of nuns would be detrimental to the duration of the Buddha’s teaching contrasts with passages highlighting the positive contributions and abilities of nuns.
* Listings in the Aṅguttara-*nikāya* and Ekottarika-*āgama* present Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and other nuns as exemplary in various abilities, forms of conduct, or attainments.
* These listings showcase qualities and behaviors common among early Buddhist nuns.
* A discourse in the Ekot-tarika-*āgama* reports a nun who aspired to be reborn as a woman through merit, challenging the notion that being born a woman is due to bad karma.

## 6.3 The Four Assemblies

* Passages emphasize the importance of the four assemblies - monks, nuns, male lay followers, and female lay followers - as integral to the Buddha's dispensation.
* The Mahāparinibbā*na-sutta* reports that the Buddha planned to have an order of nuns, asserting he wouldn't pass away until establishing all four assemblies.
* The *Lakkhaṇa-sutta* relates the Buddha's possession of four assemblies to one of his thirty-two superior bodily marks.
* Several discourses highlight the completeness of the Buddha's teaching reflected in the large numbers of liberated monks and nuns, and lay followers who have reached various levels of awakening.
* A discourse in the Aṅguttara-*nikāya* considers being reborn in a place without all four assemblies as unfortunate.

* Other passages detail the specific roles nuns played within the four assemblies.
* A stanza in the Aṅguttara-*nikāya* highlights nuns' contribution through their learnedness.
* A discourse in the Saṃyutta-*nikāya* states that respectful nuns contribute to the long duration of the Dharma.
* An Aṅguttara-*nikāya* discourse emphasizes respect among all four assemblies as crucial for the continuity of the Dharma after the Buddha's passing.



## 6.4 The First Saṅgīti

* This section discusses criticism leveled against Ānanda for promoting the founding of an order of nuns during the first saṅgīti (Buddhist council).
* Different reciter traditions place this criticism at different points in the narrative of the saṅgīti.
* The number of accusations against Ānanda varies across these traditions, ranging from one to eight.

## Dharmaguptaka:

* Mahākāśyapa accuses Ānanda of wrongdoing for seeking women's ordination.
* Ānanda defends his actions by citing Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's kindness towards the Buddha and the practice of previous Buddhas having four assemblies (including nuns).

## Haimavata (?):

* Mahākāśyapa criticizes Ānanda for ten reasons, all related to the potential negative consequences of women's ordination on lay support for monks.

## Mahāsāṃghika:

* Upāli accuses Ānanda of transgressing Vinaya by repeatedly requesting women's ordination despite the Buddha's refusal.
* Ānanda defends his actions by citing the precedent of previous Buddhas having four assemblies.

## Mahīśāsaka:

* Mahākāśyapa criticizes Ānanda for seeking women's ordination, which he considers a transgression.
* Ānanda justifies his actions by emphasizing Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's kindness and the practice of previous Buddhas.

## Mūlasarvāstivāda:

* Mahākāśyapa criticizes Ānanda for requesting women's ordination, citing the Buddha's concerns about its negative impact on the longevity of the Dharma.
* Ānanda defends his actions by highlighting Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's kindness and the precedent of previous Buddhas.

## Sarvāstivāda:

* Mahākāśyapa accuses Ānanda of wrongdoing for requesting women's ordination despite the Buddha's refusal.
* Ānanda justifies his actions by citing the practice of previous Buddhas having four assemblies.





## Theravāda:

* The elder monks accused Ānanda of wrongdoing for supporting the establishment of an order of nuns.
* Ānanda defended his actions, citing his close relationship with Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, but ultimately confessed to the offense out of faith in the elders.
* Various Buddhist traditions view Ānanda's intervention as a breach of monastic discipline, contrasting it with the Buddha's indebtedness to his foster mother.

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda account argues that Ānanda's action destroyed the Buddha's teachings rather than recompensing kindness.

*  The argument against an order of nuns is further strengthened by comparing it to frost and hail damaging a field.
* It is deemed inappropriate for Ānanda to raise family matters, as affection towards relatives should be relinquished upon entering monastic life.

* The theme of the four assemblies, found in some accounts of the first saṅ-*gīti*, also appears in discussions about the nuns' order.

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda account argues that the four assemblies are no longer possible due to humanity's degraded state, contradicting other passages that consider them integral to the Buddha's teachings.
* The Haimavata (?) account echoes concerns from other traditions, suggesting that life for monks would have been idyllic without an order of nuns.

* This version focuses solely on Ānanda's support for the nuns, highlighting potential negative repercussions attributed to Mahākāśyapa rather than the Buddha.
* It is possible that apprehensions about the nuns' order originated in accounts of the first saṅ-*gīti* and were later attributed to the Buddha due to the narrative shift.

* The Theravāda *Vinaya* might preserve an earlier version where unnamed monks voice these concerns, not yet attributed to Mahākāśyapa.
* The account of the first saṅ-*gīti* could be the ideal setting for expressing anxieties about decline after the Buddha's passing, aiming to solidify institutional authority and maintain public support.

*  The accounts of the first saṅ-*gīti* contrast Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda, with some versions suggesting Mahākāśyapa initially excluded Ānanda from the assembly.
* This contrast might reflect divisions within the monastic community, with Mahākāśyapa representing a more conservative faction.

# The Role of Mahākāśyapa

* Represents asceticism and brahminical thought.
* Seen as championing ascetic practices.
* His influence is evident in accusations against Ānanda during the first saṅgīti.

# Ascetic and Brahminical Influence on Early Buddhism

* The first saṅgīti reflects the victory of ascetic and brahminical values.
* This faction controlled the transmission of texts, influencing their content.
* Negative appraisal of nuns likely stems from these influences.

# Nuns and Public Image

* Nuns' existence challenged brahminical norms regarding women.
* Their visibility in urban settings made them targets of scrutiny.
* Economic power of nuns may have fueled resentment and competition.

# The Buddha's Prediction and Negative Attitudes

* Accounts of the foundation history record a prediction by the Buddha that nuns would shorten his dispensation.
* This contrasts with other passages highlighting nuns as integral to Buddhism.
* Accusations against Ānanda suggest fear of decline and negative attitudes towards nuns originated during the first saṅgīti.

# Impact on Monastic Community

* The first saṅgīti marks the success of ascetics and brahminical values in shaping Buddhist monasticism.
* This shift resulted in a increasingly negative attitude towards nuns, evident in foundation histories. 




# Conclusion

* A comparative study of seven versions of the nuns' order foundation history reveals gradual textual growth and multivocality in early Buddhist discourse on women.
* The basic storyline involves Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī requesting permission for women to join the monastic order, initially refused by the Buddha.
* After shaving their heads and following the Buddha, they are granted permission with injunctions on communal transactions, aimed at protecting them and preventing negative perceptions.

* These injunctions reflect societal norms and anxieties surrounding women's autonomy.
* The narrative underwent transformations, including the possible initial suggestion of home-based celibacy before going forth.
* Negative attitudes towards nuns emerged, portraying them as a source of danger and blaming them for challenges faced by the monastic community.

* This negativity is linked to a shift in attitudes favoring ascetic ideals and brahminical values after the Buddha's passing.
* The shortened lifespan of the Buddha's dispensation attributed to the nuns' existence reflects this shift.

* Ānanda intercedes on their behalf, reminding the Buddha of Mahāprajāpatī's kindness in raising him.
* The Buddha acknowledges her kindness but reiterates his concerns about women joining the order.

* He explains that allowing women would be like a house with few men and many women, which would lead to ruin.
*  He compares it to a rice field destroyed by frost and hail. 
* The Buddha emphasizes the great kindness Mahāprajāpatī has shown him.
* He acknowledges that she deserves immense gratitude for her actions.

* Ānanda asks if women who join the order can attain enlightenment.
* The Buddha confirms they can, leading Ānanda to request permission for them to ordain.
* The Buddha lays down eight principles for nuns that cannot be transgressed. These include showing respect to monks, not scolding them, and seeking guidance from the monastic community.

*  Ānanda relays these principles to Mahāprajāpatī, who accepts them on behalf of herself and the other women.
* The Buddha declares that by accepting these principles, the women have received ordination.
* He adds that if women had not joined the order, his teachings would have lasted five hundred years longer.

* Ānanda is saddened by this statement, realizing the potential consequences of allowing women to join the monastic order.

# The (Haimavata?) *Vinayamātṛkā Version1

* The Buddha initially refuses to allow women to join his monastic order.
* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and 500 other women, determined to follow the Buddha's teachings, shave their heads, put on robes, and follow him.
* Ānanda intercedes on their behalf, arguing that women who practice diligently can attain enlightenment.
* The Buddha agrees to allow women to join the monastic order but sets eight precepts for them to follow.

# The Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya Version1

*  Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and other women request ordination from the Buddha, who initially refuses.
* They decide to follow him anyway, cutting their hair and wearing robes.
* When they encounter the Buddha again, he still refuses their request.
* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī pleads with Ānanda to ask the Buddha again.
* The Buddha reiterates his refusal, but Ānanda informs Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī of the Buddha's decision. 





# Ānanda's First Two Requests

* The Buddha states it is difficult for women to attain enlightenment.
* He compares allowing women into the monastic order to diseases that defile a field.
* He tells Ananda he will not allow women to become nuns.

# Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's Request

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī asks Ānanda to request again from the Buddha.

# Ānanda's Third Request

* Ānanda questions the Buddha about past Buddhas and their assemblies.
* He learns that women can attain enlightenment just like men.
* He argues that since women can achieve enlightenment, they should be allowed to become nuns.

# The Buddha's Reluctance

* The Buddha acknowledges Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's kindness towards him.
* He emphasizes the great debt he owes her for raising him.
* He explains how difficult it is to repay such a debt.

# The Eight Gurudharmas

* To appease Ānanda and allow women into the monastic order, the Buddha establishes eight rules for nuns.
* These rules place nuns in a subordinate position to monks.
* Accepting these rules becomes the condition for Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's ordination as a nun.

# Acceptance of the Rules

* Ānanda relays the Buddha's conditions to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī.
* He explains each of the eight gurudharmas in detail.
* He informs her that accepting these rules and avoiding four transgressions will grant her ordination.

## Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī’s Ordination

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī expresses her joy at receiving permission to become ordained, comparing it to receiving a garland of flowers.
* She declares her commitment to following the eight *gurudharma*s and avoiding the four offenses that lead to failure.

## The Buddha's Initial Hesitation

* King Śuddhodana requests ordination but the Buddha advises him against it, suggesting he will attain enlightenment through gradual practice.
* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī hears the king’s proclamation allowing people to join the sangha and decides to seek ordination for herself and other women.

## The Buddha's Reluctance and Ānanda's Advocacy

* The Buddha initially refuses Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī’s request three times, citing tradition and potential harm to the Dharma.
* Ānanda pleads with the Buddha on her behalf, highlighting her kindness towards him and arguing that women are capable of attaining enlightenment.

## The Eight Gurudharmas

* The Buddha finally relents and grants permission for women to ordain under eight specific conditions known as *gurudharma*s. 
* These rules govern interactions between nuns and monks, including requirements for receiving guidance, observing the rainy season retreat, and addressing offenses.

## Concerns About Women's Ordination

* The Buddha expresses concerns about the impact of women’s ordination on the longevity of the Dharma.
* He worries that it will lead to a decline in respect for monastic discipline and potentially cause the sangha to deteriorate.

## Acceptance and Fulfillment

* Despite his reservations, the Buddha affirms his decision and instructs Ānanda to inform Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī.
* She accepts the conditions joyfully and becomes the first Buddhist nun, paving the way for countless women to follow her path.

## The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya Version1

* The Buddha was staying at Kapilavastu when Mahāprajāpatī, along with five hundred Śākyan women, requested permission to become nuns.
* The Buddha initially refused their request three times, suggesting they stay home and cultivate the holy life.
* Mahāprajāpatī persisted, following the Buddha until he finally agreed to allow women to become nuns but laid down eight principles for them to follow.

## The Eight Principles

* Nuns should seek ordination from monks.
* Every fortnight, nuns should request exhortation from monks.
* Nuns cannot observe the rainy season in a place without monks. 




# 4)

* Nuns cannot interrogate or remind monks about faults in morality, view, conduct, or livelihood.
* Monks can rebuke nuns for such transgressions.

# 5)

* Nuns cannot scold or upbraid monks.
* Monks can do this towards nuns.

# 6)

* Even a senior nun must revere and pay homage to a newly ordained monk.

# 7)

* A nun who transgresses a rule requiring confession should undergo penance in both communities for a fortnight.

# 8)


* At the end of the rainy season, a nun should participate in the invitation ceremony in both communities regarding what has been seen, heard, or suspected.

## The (Sarvāstivāda) Madhyama-Āgama Version1

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī asks the Buddha if women can attain enlightenment and become nuns.
* The Buddha initially refuses, stating that allowing women to ordain would shorten the lifespan of Buddhism. 
* He compares it to a household with many women and few men, or a field overrun with weeds.

* Ānanda intercedes on Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's behalf, reminding the Buddha of her kindness and devotion.
* The Buddha acknowledges her contributions but maintains his stance against female ordination. 

* He then outlines eight guiding principles for nuns to follow if they are allowed to ordain:
    1. Seek higher ordination from monks.
    2. Receive fortnightly exhortation from monks.
    3. Spend the rainy season in a dwelling with monks.
    4. Request clarification on matters seen, heard, or suspected in both assemblies.
    5. Only ask monks questions about Dharma if permitted.
    6. Cannot report a monk's offense; a monk can report a nun's offense.
    7. Undergo penance for fifteen days for offenses requiring suspension.
    8. Show humility towards newly ordained monks, even if they have been nuns for many years.

* The Buddha states that if Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī upholds these eight principles, she can be considered a nun and train in the path of Buddhism.

# The Eight Guiding Principles for Nuns

* A nun should seek higher ordination from the monks.
* A nun should every fortnight approach the monks to receive exhortation.
* A nun cannot spend the rainy season in a dwelling place where no monks are present.
* A nun who has completed the rainy season should request three matters in both assemblies: seeking [invitation] in regard to what has been seen, heard, or suspected. 
* If a monk does not permit questions by a nun, the nun cannot ask the monk about the discourses, the *Vinaya* or the Abhidharma. If he permits questions, the nun can ask about the discourses, the *Vinaya* or the Abhidharma.
* A nun cannot tell [others] about a monk's offence; a monk can tell [others] about a nun's offence. 
* A nun who has committed an offence requiring suspension has to undergo penance in both assemblies for fifteen days.
* Although a nun has received higher ordination up to a hundred years ago, she should therefore still show utmost humility towards a newly ordained monk by paying homage with her head [at his feet], being respectful and reverential, greeting him with palms together [in homage].

# Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī's Simile

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī compares receiving the eight guiding principles to a beautiful girl who adorns herself.
* Someone who cares for her gives her a flower wreath, which she accepts joyfully.
* Similarly, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī receives the guiding principles with joy and upholds them throughout her life.

# The Request for Reverence Towards Nuns

* Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī requests that young monks pay homage to senior nuns as a sign of respect. 
* She emphasizes their seniority and experience in the holy life.

# The Buddha's Response

* The Buddha cautions Ānanda against making such a request, stating that it is inappropriate for monks to pay homage to nuns.
* He explains that if women had not become nuns, people would have shown even greater reverence to male ascetics.
* The Buddha highlights the importance of women in Buddhism and how their presence has contributed to the spread of the Dharma.
* However, he also states that women cannot attain certain positions of power or enlightenment that are open to men.

## The Theravāda Aṅguttara-Nikāya Version1

* Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī requests the Buddha three times to allow women to become nuns, but he refuses.
* She travels to Vesālī and waits outside the monastery, sorrowful and weeping. 
* Ānanda sees her and asks why she is upset.
* He learns of her request and asks the Buddha again on her behalf, but the Buddha still refuses.
* Ānanda then asks if women are capable of attaining enlightenment after becoming nuns, and the Buddha confirms they are.

* Ānanda argues that since Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been a great service to the Buddha, she should be allowed to become a nun. 
* The Buddha agrees but sets forth eight rules (*garudhamma*) for nuns, which must be followed for life. These include: paying homage to monks, not spending the rainy season without monks, receiving guidance from monks, confessing offenses before both communities, undergoing penance for serious offenses, seeking higher ordination from both communities, not criticizing monks, and accepting criticism from monks.
* Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these rules with joy.

* The Buddha tells Ānanda that if women had not become nuns, the holy life would have lasted a thousand years, but now it will only last five hundred. He compares this to a household with many women and few men being vulnerable to robbers, a rice field being affected by disease, and a sugarcane field being affected by red rust.
* The Buddha explains that he set forth these eight rules for nuns as a precaution to protect the holy life.

## 278 The Foundation History Of The Nuns' Order

* Examines the foundation history of the Buddhist order of nuns based on canonical accounts in Chinese, Pali, Sanskrit, and Tibetan.
* Investigates how different and conflicting parts of the textual account evolved to constitute the foundation history.
* Analyzes the Buddha's refusal to found an order of nuns and the prediction that women's going forth spells decline for Buddhism.

## Band 1

* Anālayo investigates the genesis of the bodhisattva ideal, a key concept in Buddhist thought.
* Analyzes early discourses from Pāli and Chinese sources that influenced the development of the bodhisattva ideal.
* Argues that early sources don't present compassion as the Buddha's primary motivation for seeking awakening.

## Band 2

* Anālayo explores the beginnings of Abhidharma, another important aspect of Buddhist thought.
* Challenges the common view that Abhidharma arose from formal elements like lists and question-and-answer formats.
* Argues that Abhidharma developed as an attempt to create a comprehensive map of Buddhist teachings, leading to new terminology and ideas.

## Band 3

* Edited by Lin, Chen-kuo / Radich, Michael, this book investigates the Chinese reception of Indian Buddhist ideas in the 6th and 7th centuries.
* Explores topics like Buddhist logic, commentaries on Indian texts, and Chinese interpretations of systems like Madhyamaka and Yogācāra.
* Aims to challenge the notion of "sinification" by considering Chinese materials as evidence of broader Buddhist trends.

## Band 4

* Jonathan A. Silk provides an edition, translation, and study of the "Anūnatvāpūrṇatvanirdeśaparivarta," a short Mahāyāna sūtra.
* The sūtra expresses ideas about the unity of saṁsāra and nirvāṇa and the innate capacity for awakening in every individual ("tathāgatagarbha").

## Band 5

* Michael Radich argues that the "Mahāparinirvāṇa-mahāsūtra" is an earlier source of tathāgatagarbha doctrine than the Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra.
* Suggests that tathāgatagarbha ideas originated as part of docetic Buddhology, which questioned the physical reality of Buddhas.
* The Mahāparinirvāṇa-mahāsūtra presents tathāgatagarbha as a substitute for imperfect human maternity, promising liberation from flesh.
