# Foreword

* The Numata Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Hamburg publishes the *Hamburg Buddhist Studies* series, honoring the university's commitment to Buddhist Studies research.
* The series aims to share its findings with both academics and the general public.
* Buddhist Studies today uses a wide range of approaches and methods, covering contemporary issues as well as historical aspects of Buddhism.

# Introduction

* Vinaya studies are flourishing due to the centrality of these materials in Buddhist tradition.
* This volume contributes to a growing body of scholarship addressing the diverse ways Buddhist monastic law has been implemented across time and place.
* It builds on previous works like *Going Forth* (2005) and *Buddhism and Law* (2014), focusing on monastic regulations, Chan precepts, and other non-Vinaya precepts preserved throughout Asia.
* Contributors explore how individuals and communities used legal materials in various ways to achieve diverse goals.
* The volume highlights previously unknown or unstudied Vinaya materials, such as Sanskrit, Pāli, Tocharian, Gāndhārī, Chinese, and Tibetan manuscripts excavated across Asia.



## Tocharian Vinaya Texts From Turfan And Kucha
* The second oldest excavated Vinaya manuscripts are Tocharian fragments dating to between the sixth and eighth century.
* Tocharian is a language spoken in Kucha and Turfan along the northern edge of the Tarim Basin in Northwest China. 
* Two dialects—Tocharian A and B—likely flourished as literary languages in the middle of the first millennium CE.
* Research on Vinaya texts among this Tocharian collection began in 1912.

## Sanskrit Vinaya Texts
* In 1931, scholars uncovered numerous Sanskrit manuscripts written on birch bark in Gilgit. These materials are known as the Gilgit Manuscripts.
* This collection contains seventeen *Vinayavastu* texts, four incomplete *Bhikṣuprātimokṣa* texts, and two *Karmavācanā* texts.
* Apart from Gilgit sources, Sanskrit Vinaya texts are also found in Tibet.

## Pāli Vinaya Texts
* A complete set of *Vinaya-piṭaka* is preserved in Pāli. 
* The oldest surviving Pāli manuscript is a Vinaya manuscript copied on palm-leaf during the eighth or ninth century.
* This document was found in Nepal and comprises the very end of *Culla-vagga* IV and the beginning of V.

## Vinaya Texts In Chinese Translation
* Large collections of major complete sets of Vinaya texts are extant in Chinese.
* The first Indian Vinaya text translated into Chinese is the Sengqi jiexin (The Heart of Precepts of the Mahāsāṃghikas*), attributed to Dharmakāla; he purportedly completed the project around 250 CE.
* Translations of the Sarvāstivādavinaya in 404 CE, the Dharmaguptakavinaya in 408 CE, the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya in 418 CE, and the Mahīśāsakavinaya in 424 CE indicate a boom in the translation of these materials during this period.

## Vinaya Texts In Tibetan Translation
* The Tibetan Buddhist canon also preserves a complete set of Vinaya texts.
* These materials occupy thirteen volumes of the Bka' 'gyur (Sde dge).
* While scholars have long believed the majority of the Vinaya texts preserved in Tibetan translation are related to the Mūlasarvāstivādin School, recent studies question this assumption. 

## Overview Of The Volume Part I: Identifying The Rules Of Engagement
* This section aims to advance our understanding of Sanskrit, Tocharian, Tibetan, and Chinese Vinaya material preserved and circulated in Eastern Turkestan, Tibet, and China.
* Chung Jin-il provides an overview of extant Sanskrit fragments of the Sarvāstivādavinaya.
* Pan Tao's article focuses on Tocharian Vinaya fragments.
* Wang's "Faxian and the Transmission of Vinayas to China" focuses on one Buddhist cleric's central role in the transmission of Buddhist regulation texts from India to China.
* Cuilan Liu's paper surveys the transmission of Vinaya texts in Tibet, focusing on novice precepts.

## Part Ii: Assessing Relationships Between Traditions Of Regulation

* This section explores relationships between monastic regulations across different Buddhist traditions.
* Paul Groner examines how Tendai Buddhists in Japan engaged with the Vinaya tradition, drawing on diverse sources like the *Fanwang Jing*, Lotus Sūtra, and *Yingluo Jing*.
* Mario Poceski analyzes Tiantai and Chan monastic rules from the Sui and Tang dynasties, highlighting shared concerns about laxity in Buddhist regulations.
* Pei-ying Lin investigates the doctrinal foundations of the "mind precept" in early Chan Buddhism, linking it to scriptural traditions like the *Fanwang jing* and *Lengqie jing*.

## Part Iii: Investigating The Implementation Of Individual Regulations

* This section focuses on how specific monastic regulations were implemented in practice.
* Stuart examines procedures for settling disputes in Vinaya texts, revealing a complex interplay between consensus-building and authoritarian pathways.
* Nicholas Witkowski challenges the notion that ascetic practices were marginal to Indian Buddhism, arguing that practices like using cemetery robes continued into the mature monastic period.
* Sasaki provides a detailed analysis of pācittiya rules regarding monks' interactions with female monastics, highlighting diversity across Vinaya traditions.
* Anālayo explores the situation of female monastics and the controversy surrounding their ordination lineage, considering historical, legal, and cultural contexts.
* Eric Greene challenges the assumption that pā*rājika* transgressions resulted in expulsion, showing how rituals allowed offenders to remain within the clergy with reduced privileges. 




## Part Iv: Exploring Communities Of Vinaya-Related Practice

* This section explores how familiarity with Vinaya traditions helps understand phenomena like Huineng's shifting hagiography.
* It examines the contexts in which Vinaya movements took shape, such as mountain versus city settings in sixth and seventh-century China or twin Chanding monasteries.
* The papers highlight the suppleness of the past and its varied interpretations in reconstructing religious histories.

## The Transformation of the Formless Precepts in the Platform Sūtra

* Schlütter examines the diminishing importance of "formless precepts" in the *Platform Sūtra* between the eighth and thirteenth centuries.
* These precepts were central to earlier versions but became eclipsed by repentance rituals in later editions, possibly due to Chan communities' efforts to attract support in changing contexts.
* Schlütter emphasizes the diversity of approaches to precepts within traditions over time and how this shaped hagiographies.

## A Missing Page in Sui-Tang Vinaya History

* Chen reconstructs the life and career of vinaya master Zhishou (567–635), a key figure in the development of the Lüzong tradition.
* Chen places Zhishou within a network of practitioners connected to twin Chanding monasteries in Chang'an, establishing them as major hubs for Lüzong.

## Occidental Astrology and Early Chinese Buddhism

* Kotyk examines the introduction and reception of occidental astrology in Chinese Buddhist history during the first millennium.
* Despite initial condemnation by Buddhists, observing celestial movements became widely accepted by the eighth century, spearheaded by tantric communities.
* This case study demonstrates how ostensibly prohibited activities can become key practices within religious communities.





## 1 General Remarks

* Valentina Rosen published her Ph.D. thesis on the Vinayavibhaṅga in 1959, based on Sanskrit fragments from Eastern Turkestan.
* She analyzed and summarized the Chinese version of this text, making it accessible to many researchers.
* Since then, more Sanskrit fragments have been identified as belonging to the same text.

## 2 Transliteration

* This section presents a transliteration of P.Skt. Rouge 10.1–6 and Bleu 44, which contain parts of the Śaikṣadharma section of the Sūtravibhaṅga.

# A Glimpse Into The Tocharian Vinaya Texts

* This article introduces the *Vinaya* literature preserved in the Tocharian language.
* It provides a concise description of the Tocharian language, focusing on chronology and geographical distribution of manuscripts.

## About The Tocharian Language

* Tocharian is an Indo-European language with two dialects: Tocharian A (TA) and Tocharian B (TB).
* TB can be further classified into three dialects: Central, Western, and Eastern.
* Dating Tocharian texts relies on palaeographical studies and 14C dating.
* The most archaic manuscripts date back to the 4th or early 5th century CE.
* Large numbers of Tocharian manuscripts were produced between the 6th and 8th centuries CE.

## 1 Tocharian Texts In General

* **Berlin Collection:**
    * Fragments catalogued by find spot, time of discovery, and THT number.
    * Standard text editions by Emil Sieg and Wilhelm Siegling (1921, 1949, 1953) cover fragments THT 1–116.

* **Digital Resources:**
    * TITUS: Digitalized over 4000 Tocharian fragments from the Berlin collection.
    * CEToM: Contains all published Tocharian fragments by Sieg and Siegling with photos.
    * IDP: Provides photos of the Berlin collection.





## 2 London Collection

* Most fragments are part of the Hoernle collection and were initially catalogued with numbers like "H 149".
* Later, they were re-catalogued under the series name "IOL Toch" as part of the International Dunhuang Project.
* J.W. Broomhead prepared a standard text edition of some materials in 1962, including an English translation and glossary.
* Peyrot and Tamai created an online edition based on Broomhead's work in 2007.

## 3 Paris Collection

* The collection is called Pelliot Koutchéen (PK) and is divided into five categories.
* PK AS and PK NS contain almost all Vinaya texts.
* Sylvain Lévi edited Tocharian Udā*navarga*, Udānastotra, Udānālaṁkāra and *Karmavibha*ṅga in 1933.
* Jean Filliozat published an edition of Tocharian medical and magical texts in 1948.
* Other fragments have been published by Georges-Jean Pinault and Walter Couvreur.

## 4 Other Collections

* Important corpora include the St. Petersburg collection, Otani collection in Japan, and manuscripts from Xinjiang China.
* The 44 fragments of *Maitreyasamiti-Nāṭaka* discovered in Qigexing were edited and published by Xianlin Ji, Werner Winter and Georges-Jean Pinault in 1998.

## 2 Tocharian Dictionaries And Glossaries 1 For Tocharian B

* Sieg and Siegling's glossary in their 1949 text edition contains many important West-Tocharian words.
* Wolfgang Krause and Werner Thomas attached a glossary to their *Tocharisches Elementarbuch*.
* Verbal lists in Krause's *Westtocharische Grammatik* and Sieg, Siegling and Schulze's *Tocharische Grammatik* are fundamental for the Tocharian verbal lexicon.

## 2 For Tocharian A

* There is no updated and complete dictionary of East-Tocharian.
* Pavel Poucha's 1955 *Thesaurus Linguae Tocharicae Dialecti A* covers all letters.
* The glossary in *Tocharisches Elementarbuch* is helpful, but only contains words appearing in the book.

## 3 Etymological

* There is no Tocharian dictionary comparable to PW, pw, or MW.
* Indo-European linguistics is crucial for deciphering Tocharian.
* van Windekens' *Lexique étymologique des dialectes tokhariens* and Hilmarsson's *Materials for a Tocharian Historical and Etymological Dictionary* are dedicated solely to Tocharian etymology.

## 3 Tocharian Vinaya Texts 1 Tocharian Vinaya Terms

* An East-Tocharian fragment from Šorčuq preserves some rule names: Pārājika, Saṃghāvaśeṣa, Aniyata, Naiḥsargika, Pātayantika, Pratideśanīya and Śaikṣa.
* Sometimes the specific rule name is not stated, only general terms like 'sin' or 'deprived'.

## 2 Distribution Of Vinaya Texts In The Collections

* *Prātimokṣasūtra*, *Vinayavibhaṅga* and *Karmavācana* are distributed unevenly across collections due to their fragmentary nature.
* Prātimokṣasūtra text is found in many fragments, as are *Vinayavibhaṅga* texts. Many *Karmavācana* fragments also exist.

## Prātimokṣasūtra

* Berlin collection: THT 314-328 contain various sections of the Prātimokṣasūtra.
* London collection: IOL Toch 112, 117, 62, 124, 246 and 168 contain different sections of the Prātimokṣasūtra.
* Paris collection: "PK NS" contains *Naiḥsargika-Pātayantika* 7–8 and *Pātayantika* 45–52.





## Vinayavibhaṅga

* Fragments containing various types of rules are found in both Berlin and London collections.
* The Paris collection contains fragments with Saṃghāvaśeṣa, Aniyata, Naiḥsargika-Pātayantika, and Pātayantika rules. 

## Karmavācana

* The Berlin collection holds West-Tocharian *Karmavācana* folios, while the Paris collection has fragments containing Upasaṃpadā, Poṣatha, and Pravāraṇā parts.


## 3 Scholastic Affiliation

* Early Tocharologists proposed different scholastic affiliations for Tocharian texts.
* Schmidt concluded that Tocharian Prātimokṣa and Vinayavibhaṅga fragments belong to the Sarvāstivāda school.
* Ogihara suggests that Tocharian Vinaya texts align with the Sarvāstivādins, but some deviations might indicate different textual traditions within the school.

## 4 Two Examples

* This section analyzes two short Tocharian *Vinayavibhaṅga* texts to clarify their relationship with Chinese *Vinaya* texts.
* The chosen examples are Pātayantika 89 and Pātayantika 73, which deal with the use of mats and digging into the earth respectively.

## 1 Pātayantika 89 Preliminary Remarks

* This rule concerns the use of mats to protect community beds from getting dirty.
* The Tocharian text is compared with the Chinese *Sarvāstivādin* version, which provides detailed information on the rule's motivation and implementation.

## Chinese Text

* The Chinese text explains that the Buddha ordered monks to use mats to protect community beds from dirt.

## Concordance: Tocharian Text compared with Chinese text

* This section presents a word-by-word comparison of the Tocharian and Chinese texts, providing English translations for each term.


## 2 Pātayantika 73 Preliminary Remark

* This rule prohibits monks from digging into the earth to avoid harming living beings.
* The Tocharian text provides details about various situations where digging is prohibited.





## Chinese Text

* **Specific situations:** The Tocharian text mentions specific cases related to digging into the earth, which are also found in the Mūlasarvāstivādin and Mahāsaṃghika schools of Chinese Buddhism.

* **Rule number:** The rule about digging into the earth is the 73rd in both the Tocharian text and the texts of these two Chinese schools.
* **Missing beginning:** The beginning part of the Tocharian text is missing, which might have contained cases mentioned in Sarvā*stivādin school materials.

## Sarvāstivādin

* Monks dug into the earth to build foundations, ditches, lakes, and wells.
* A non-Buddhist layman criticized them for harming living beings by digging.
* Digging in muddy areas up to knee depth was considered a *duṣkr̥ta*-crime.

## Mūlasarvāstivādin

* Monks dug into the earth themselves or hired others to do so for various purposes, including building dykes and destroying anthills.
* Non-Buddhists criticized them for doing secular work and harming living beings.
* Shaking mud in a river or lake and lifting earthen jars from muddy places were considered *duṣkrta*-crimes.

## Mahāsaṃghika

* Walking on the ground to flatten it was considered a transgression of Vinaya rules if it caused harm.
* Unintentional damage to the ground was not considered a crime.
* Throwing wood, stones, bricks, or other objects onto the ground unintentionally did not constitute a crime.
* Monks were not allowed to take mud pushed together by rain or wet objects left in the open; they should ask an Upā*saka* to do so.

## Concordance: Possible Chinese Correspondence

* The Tocharian text mentions specific actions related to digging and moving earth, which have corresponding descriptions in the Chinese texts.
* Some Tocharian words are analyzed for their possible meanings based on the context of the Chinese translations.


## 5 Concluding Remarks

* Tocharian materials can be valuable for understanding Vinaya literature.
* Interdisciplinary research involving Tocharologists, Buddhologists, and linguists is crucial.
* Tocharian Buddhism and translators played a significant role in the transmission of Buddhist teachings to China.

# Faxian And The Transmission Of Vinayas To China

* Faxian was the first documented Chinese traveler to reach India and brought back three important Vinaya texts.
* These texts were crucial for establishing different Buddhist monastic traditions in China.

## Vinaya Transmission To China Prior To Faxian'S Travel To India3

* It is unclear if Vinaya was transmitted to China when Buddhism was introduced in the 1st century CE.
* Even if it was, there would have been very few texts.
* The earliest record of Vinaya translation dates back to the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE).

## At The End Of This Biography, It Reads,

* Two Vinaya texts were translated during the Jin Dynasty (265-420 CE) by Zhu Fonian and other monks.
* These texts belonged to the Sarvāstivāda tradition.
* Another Vinaya text, *Bi'naiye*, was translated in 383 CE by Zhu Fonian.



## The Vinaya Texts Brought Back By Faxian

* **Introduction:** Understanding Buddhism's development in China and the transmission of Vinaya texts during Faxian's time helps us understand his journey to India and actions there. This section also discusses the situation of Buddhism in India and Central Asia, particularly the relationship between Vinaya and Buddhist sects.
* **Faxian's Search for Vinaya Texts:**

    * Faxian traveled to India seeking Vinaya texts, which were primarily transmitted orally at that time.
    * He obtained several Vinaya texts, including the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya, Sarvāstivādavinaya, and Mahīśāsakavinaya.
    * Notably, he acquired the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya from a Mahāyāna monastery, indicating its use by both schools.

* **Faxian's Return to China:**

    * After spending eight years in India, Faxian returned to China with several Sanskrit texts, including Vinayas and sutras.
    * He translated some of these texts at Daochang monastery with the Indian monk Buddhabhadra.

* **Other Comprehensive Vinaya Texts in China:**

    * Before Faxian's return, two other comprehensive Vinaya texts had already reached China: the Sarvāstivādavinaya and the Dharmaguptakavinaya.
    * The Sarvāstivādavinaya was translated by Kumārajīva with the help of several monks, including Puṇyatāra and Vimalākṣa.

* **The Arrival of the Dharmaguptakavinaya:**

    * The Dharmaguptakavinaya was translated later than the Sarvāstivādavinaya, from 410 to 412 CE.
    * It was recited by Buddhayaśas and translated by Zhu Fonian.




## Faxian And The Transmission Of Vinaya In China

* Vinaya is one of the "Three Precious Jewels" in Buddhism and essential for both individual monks and the monastic community.
* Five sets of complete Vinaya texts were introduced to China: Sarvāstivādavinaya, Mahāsāṃghikavinaya, Mahīśāsakavinaya, Dharmaguptakavinaya, and Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya.

## Faxian's Contribution

* Faxian brought three sets of Vinaya texts to China from India and Sri Lanka: Sengzhi biqiu jieben, another incomplete set known as Sapoduo lüchao, and participated in the translation of Mahāsāṃghikavinaya.
* The Mahīśāsakavinaya was translated shortly after Faxian's death in 422 CE by Buddhajīva.

## Significance of Faxian's Work

*  The transmission of the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya is closely linked to Faxian.
* Although less significant, the Mahīśāsakavinaya was an important source for monks studying Vinaya and a medium for its transmission.
* The Sapoduo lüchao remained untranslated because a complete set of Sarvāstivādavinaya had already been translated by Kumārajīva and others upon Faxian's return to China. 




## Concluding Remarks: The Significance Of Faxian

* Faxian's contributions are significant for understanding Buddhist texts, particularly Vinayas, in China.
* He brought back two important Vinaya texts (Mahāsāṃghikavinaya and Mahīśāsakavinaya) that might have been lost otherwise.
* These texts are crucial for studying Buddhism, its history, and the differences between various sects.

## A Survey Of Vinaya Texts On Novice Precepts Preserved In Tibetan

* This paper identifies all extant Tibetan Vinaya texts on novice precepts from three sources: Tibetan Buddhist canon, KDSB, and later Tibetan works.
* Studying these texts is important because they offer insights into aspects of Buddhist law not found in other Vinaya texts.
* For example, rules regarding song, dance, and music are detailed only in commentaries on novice precepts.
* This survey helps scholars contextualize Tibetan Vinaya texts and facilitates comparative study. 




## Indic Vinaya Texts On Novice Precepts

* **Buddhist Arrival in Tibet:** Buddhism arrived in Tibet in two waves, with the first wave bringing numerous Indian scholars who translated Buddhist texts including Vinaya texts. The Tibetans primarily focused on the Mūlasarvāstivāda School's Vinaya.

* **Standardization of Translation:** In 814, Tibetan king Khri lde srong btsan convened a meeting with Indian and Tibetan scholars to standardize the translation of Buddhist terms from Sanskrit to Tibetan. He also issued an edict permitting only the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya's translation into Tibetan.

* **Texts on Novice Precepts:** The Tibetan Buddhist canon *Bstan 'gyur* preserves several texts on novice precepts, including:
    * **NĀ (Āryamūlasarvāstivādiśramaṇerakārikā):** A foundational text on novice precepts, likely available in Tibetan around the early ninth century.

    * **Text L2 (*Sarvāstivādiśramaṇerakaraṇa*):** A commentary on NĀ, with no information about its author or translator.
    * **Text L3 (Śramaṇeraśikṣapadasūtra):** Attributed to Kalyāṇamitra, translated by Grong khyer dpe med kyi Paṇḍita Mahājñana and revised by Gzhon nu mchog in the late tenth or early eleventh century.
    * **Text L4 (*Śramaṇapañcāśatkārikāpradābhismaraṇa*):** A commentary on NĀ attributed to Kamalaśīla, translated by Ye shes sde in the ninth century.

    * **Text S1a (ŚĀ - *Sum brgya pa*):** Contains three hundred stanzas and is an auto-commentary of NĀ.
    * **Text S1b (ĀBH - *Od ldan*):** An auto-commentary on ŚĀ, translated by Sarvajñādeva and Devendrarakṣita.

    * **Text S2 (*Triśatakārikāvyākyāna* or *Slob phan*):** A commentary on ĀBH attributed to Vinītadeva, translated by Buddhaśānti and Dge ba'i blo gros.
    * **Text N1 (Śramaṇeravarṣāgraṃ):** Enumerates the duties of newly ordained novices in their first year, translated by Narasadeva and Rgyal ba'i shes rab.

    * **Text N2 (*Bslab bya bcu'i cho ga bzhugs*):** Describes novice ordination procedures, translated by Gzhon nu'i zhabs from Rtse thang.




## Early Tibetan Compositions On Novice Precepts

* This section discusses early Tibetan texts on novice precepts, specifically focusing on those attributed to authors associated with the Lower Vinaya lineage.

* Nine handwritten cursive texts were found in a collection compiled from manuscripts preserved in various monasteries in central Tibet.

* These texts are commentaries or elaborations on disciplinary rules for Buddhist novices.


## Authors and their Backgrounds

* Seven of the nine texts are attributed to authors dating back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, all belonging to the Lower Vinaya lineage.
* Bya 'dul 'dzin Brtson 'grus 'bar (1091– 1167) was a prolific writer and a direct disciple of Rma tshe Byang chub rdo rje, one of the four disciples of Vinaya master Rgya 'Dul ba 'dzin pa.
* Phywa pa Chos kyi seng ge (1109–1169) studied Vinaya under Bya 'dul 'dzin Brtson 'grus 'bar and wrote on various Buddhist topics, including novice precepts.
* Sbal ti Brtson 'grus dbang phyug (1129–1215) studied with several prominent Vinaya masters, including Sha mi Smon lam tshul khrims and Bya 'dul 'dzin Brtson 'grus 'bar.

* Chos kyi dbang phyug was a twelfth-century scholar who studied Vinaya from Bya 'dul 'dzin Brtson 'grus 'bar and his disciple Rtsis pa Gzhon nu seng ge.
* 'Dar Tshul khrims rgyal po (12th century) was a student of Bar tshar skye bo Tshul 'phags, who taught at Gsang phu ne'u thog monastery.

## Monasteries and their Significance


* Most of these texts were produced by associates of Zul phu monastery or Gsang phu monastery.
* Zul phu monastery was founded by Bya 'dul 'dzin Brtson 'grus 'bar and played a role in the ordination of 'Phags pa blo gros rgyal mthan, who later traveled to China.

* Gsang phu monastery was founded by Atiśa's disciples and Phywa pa Chos kyi seng ge served as its sixth abbot.

## Later Tibetan Compositions On Novice Precepts

* This section lists commentaries on novice precepts written between the fourteenth and twentieth centuries.

* The author of Text T1, Rgyal tshab rje Dar ma rin chen, was a student of Tsong kha pa Blo bzang grags pa. 
* He wrote his commentary based on Tsong kha pa's Vinaya lectures at Gnam rtse ldeng monastery in 1400.

* The author of Text T2, Chos grags ye shes, was the fourth incarnation of the Zhwa dmar lineage.
* His lineage resided at Gnas dang and Yangs pa can monasteries for over four hundred years until the tenth Zhwa dmar pa's alleged involvement in a Nepalese invasion led to their confiscation.

* The author of Text T3b, Tshe mchog gling yongs 'dzin Ye shes rgyal mtshan, wrote his commentary at the request of a novice who needed a detailed explanation of novice rules.
* He consulted works including Vinayasūtra, ŚĀ and ĀBH, as well as Dar ma rin chen's notes on Tsong kha pa's teachings.

* The remaining authors are briefly introduced:
    * Gu ge yongs 'dzin Blo bzang bstan 'dzin rgya mtsho (1748–1813) was the nineteenth throne holder of Bkra shis lhun po monastery's Tantric College.
    * Mi pham rgya mtsho (1846–1912) was an aristocrat from Khams in Eastern Tibet. His work is based on Kamalaśīla's commentary of NĀ.
    * Glag bla Bsod nam mchog 'grub (1862–1944) was a student of Mi pham rgya mtsho and wrote a brief summary of novice precepts to help newly ordained novices.

    * Blo bzang dam chos rgya mtsho (1865–1917) from Nang chen in Yushu prefecture summarized his commentary from *'Od ldan snying po*.
    * Brag dkar Blo bzang dpal ldan bstan 'dzin snyan grags also wrote on novice precepts, including another work entitled Dge tshul gyi blang dor so drug gi phyogs mthun ngos 'dzin gsal bar bkod pa and seven other works on Vinaya.

    * Gzhan phan chos kyi snang ba was the first preceptor of Rdzong sar monastery's Khams bye College and the ninth preceptor of Rdzogs chen monastery's Śrīsiṃha College.
        * He based his commentary on earlier Vinaya experts' interpretation of ĀBH, consulting the writings of his teacher O rgyan Bstan 'dzin nor bu.

## Concluding Remarks

* This section identifies nine Indic and twenty Tibetan compositions on novice precepts preserved in Tibetan.
* NĀ and ŚĀ are central influences on this literary tradition.

* Structurally:
    * NĀ contains fifty stanzas in three parts, covering daily duties, the ten main precepts, and etiquette rules.
    * ŚĀ contains three hundred stanzas in two main parts with five subcategories, focusing on the ten novice precepts and secondary rules concerning etiquette.

* The differences between NĀ and ŚĀ suggest separate developments and two distinct literary traditions.

* Tibetan compositions on novice precepts are mostly found among early Bka' gdams scholars, Dge lugs scholars, and Rnying ma scholars.
* Geographically, they were produced in central Tibet and Khams.

## Assessing Relationships Between Traditions of Regulation
### Medieval Japanese Tendai Views Of The Precepts

* **Paul Groner**


* **Introduction: Terminology:**

The paper discusses various terms used by the Japanese Tendai School for precepts. These include "PerfectSudden precepts," "Perfect precepts," "adamantine precepts," "One-mind precepts," "One-vehicle precepts," and "innate pure precepts." The author explains the nuances of each term and highlights the diversity of interpretations within the Tendai school regarding the nature and practice of precepts.

* **Japanese Tendai positions on the precepts were never unified into a consistent position.** Various lineages emerged with distinctive views, making it difficult to establish a systematic understanding.

* **The paper focuses on scriptural sources and ordination ceremonies to analyze the range of interpretations within Tendai.** 
It aims to demonstrate the vibrancy and diversity of discussions surrounding precepts in this school.




## 1 The Sources For The Precepts The Fanwang Jing

* Chinese Tiantai had used the *Fanwang Jing* precepts along with the *Sifenlü* precepts.
* When Ganjin brought orthodox vinaya ordinations to Japan, he also brought Tiantai texts and the *Fanwang* precepts.
* Saichō rejected the vinaya precepts but adopted the Tendai precepts based on the *Fanwang jing*.

* The *Fanwang* precepts presented a problem for full ordinations as they were conferred on both lay and monastic practitioners using virtually the same ceremony.
* Saichō argued that even though monks and lay practitioners used the same ordination ritual, their inclinations determined which precepts they received and practiced (*tsūju betsuji*).

* A commentary on the *Fanwang jing* might have been useful for interpreting its new use in Tendai, but this was not followed by most Tendai monks.
* Kōen's approach emphasized observing the precepts to the extent possible, motivated by compassion.
* Ninkū generally maintained a strict attitude towards monastic discipline but also discussed when it might be violated.

* The *Fanwang jing* was classified as a mix of Distinct and Perfect Teachings in Tendai doctrine because it was considered the capping sutra of the *Huayan jing*.
* The Kurodani and Rozanji lineages stressed the role of the *Fanwang jing* and gave it a higher status.

* Instead of commentaries on the *Fanwang jing*, many Tendai exegetes wrote subcommentaries on Zhiyi's commentary, the *Pusajie yi shu*.
* Temple rules administered by a capable leader were important in many cases.
* Recitation of the precepts in fortnightly assemblies (*fusatsu*) was revived by some illustrious figures in Tendai history.

## The Lotus Sūtra

* Saichō's earliest biography suggests a different approach to precepts, rejecting śrāvaka ways and Hīnayāna restrictions on dignity.
* The lineage for the precepts is said to begin with Huisi and Zhiyi hearing Śākyamuni's sermon on Vulture's Peak, based on Zhiyi's biography.

* The "Comfortable Practices" in Huisi's text restricts consorting with Hīnayāna śrāvakas*.
* Ordination would thus be purely Mahāyāna according to the "Comfortable Practices."

* The *Lotus Sūtra* had very little that could be considered specific rules for behavior.
* The *Gakushōshiki mond*ō lists sources for precepts, primarily relying on the *Lotus Sūtra*, then the *Fanwang jing*, and other texts.

* The One-vehicle precepts refer to the entire *Lotus Sūtra*.
* Later Tendai exegetes relegated the "Comfortable Practices" to an inferior position, emphasizing the essence of the precepts in the middle path of phenomena.

## Yingluo Jing

* The *Yingluo jing* is an apocryphal text closely associated with the *Fanwang jing*.
* It presents extreme positions regarding the precepts, virtually eliminating any sense of them as rules to be followed.
* The *Yingluo jing* identifies the precepts preventing evil with ten pārā*jika*, usually identified with the ten major precepts of the *Fanwang jing*.
* It states that the precepts could be conferred by virtually anyone and that a person who received the precepts and then broke them was superior to one who had not received them but abided by them anyway.

## 2 Hierarchical Discussions Of The Precepts

* Tendai exegetes were aware of contradictions between texts regarding precepts and sought to explain them through hierarchies.
* Annen distinguished three types of precepts: transmitted, called forth, and innate.
* Kōen established a hierarchy of the precepts from the *Lotus sūtra* and *Fanwang jing*, placing the *Lotus Sūtra* precepts at the highest level.
* The Ō*wakizashi* attributed different lineages of precepts to Saichō's disciples Enchō and Ennin, suggesting that those who received the *Fanwang* precepts misinterpreted them.

* Tendai thinkers linked the precepts to abstract conceptions like samaya precepts and the "treasury of the One-mind precepts."
* Discussions focused on whether the precepts could be lost or violated, and whether a physical or verbal action was required to instill them.
* Some interpretations identified the essence of the precepts with the One-mind or true aspect of the mind, making them inherent and transcending considerations of good and evil.




## 3 The Vinaya

* Tendai texts introduced to Japan by Ganjin included vinaya-based ordinations, leading to debate about Saichō's rejection of *Sifenlü* precepts for full ordination.
* While Saichō allowed provisional ordinations using Hīnayāna precepts, he acknowledged the need for some accommodation with vinaya practices.
* Tendai monks consulted works by Zhiyi and Zhanran, which referenced the vinaya, when interpreting precepts.
* Japanese Tendai commentaries on precepts departed from the vinaya in significant ways, such as considering cases where killing humans might be permissible.

## 4 Ordinations

* Tendai writings emphasized the ordination ceremony more than the actual rules conferred.
* Tendai ordinations were based on a bodhisattva precept manual written by Zhanran and revised by Saichō, with twelve parts covering introduction, refuges, confession, aspiration for enlightenment, questioning about hindrances, conferring precepts, witnessing, signs from Buddha, explanation of precepts, dedication of merit, exhortation to observe precepts.
* The ordination ceremony incorporated elements of both traditional vinaya ordinations and self-ordinations, reflecting a tension between institutional continuity and direct transmission from the Buddha.
* The Kurodani lineage on Mount Hiei conducted an additional "consecrated ordination" after twelve years of training, reenacting the Lotus Sūtra's portrayal of Śākyamuni in Prabhūtaratna's reliquary.
* Annen's Detailed commentary on the universal ordination for the bodhisattva precepts identified the ordination with the realization of Buddhahood with this very body, but emphasized the *Lotus Sūtra* over the *Fanwang jing*, leading to abstract interpretations and lax views of monastic discipline.



# The Essence of the Perfect Precepts According to the Eshin Lineage

* The Eshin lineage believes that there should be no ordination ceremony for the Perfect precepts other than the three views in a single instant (*isshin sangan* 一心三観).
* This lineage maintains that the vehicle and the precepts are identical, and the three trainings are non-dual.
* The true essence of the Perfect precepts is adhering to the Lotus Sūtra.

# Enchin's Conservative Interpretation

* Enchin, head of the Tendai order, lamented the lack of monastic discipline among Tendai monks.
* He noted their ignorance of Buddhist teachings and disregard for monastic rules.
* To address this, he annotated Saichō's ordination manual, emphasizing distinct ordinations for monks and distinguishing them from lay ordinations.

# Jitsudō Ninkū's Systematization

* Jitsudō Ninkū, a skilled exegete and administrator, continued Enchin's work by establishing a system of precepts based on Daoxuan's teachings.
* He proposed different sets of precepts for lay believers, novices, and monks.
* Ninkū argued that the *Fanwang jing* precepts should be considered an independent text equal to the *Lotus Sūtra*.

# Diverse Interpretations and Practices

* The lack of a single authority and the mixture of traditions led to diverse interpretations of the precepts within Tendai Buddhism.
* Some advocated for strict adherence to monastic discipline, while others emphasized debate and abstract understanding.

# Conclusion: A Spectrum of Meanings

* Tendai ordinations served various purposes, including initiating monks into religious orders, affirming Buddhahood, and marking the culmination of practice.
* The variety of interpretations and practices reflects the complexity of Tendai thought on the precepts.
* Further research is needed to fully understand the nuances and historical context of these diverse perspectives.

## Bibliography

* This section lists various publications related to Buddhism, specifically focusing on Tendai and monastic practices. It includes books, journals, and collected works from different authors and institutions.

## The Creation Of Monastic Codes And The Gradual Transformation Of Medieval Chinese Buddhist Monasticism

* This chapter explores the evolution of Buddhist monasticism in medieval China, emphasizing the creation of new monastic codes as adaptations and expansions of traditional Vinaya practices.
* It challenges the notion of a sharp break between Indian and Chinese monasticism, arguing that Tiantai and Chan monks saw themselves as part of the broader Buddhist tradition.
* The chapter examines monastic codes created by influential figures like Zhiyi, Guishan, and Xuefeng, highlighting their contributions to the ongoing development of Chinese Buddhist monasticism.
* It emphasizes that these new codes were meant to complement existing Vinaya regulations rather than replace them entirely.
* This chapter is part of a larger project investigating medieval Chinese monasticism, focusing on Tiantai and Chan traditions during the Sui and Tang dynasties. 




## The Monastic Heritage

* Buddhism emphasizes monasticism, with monks and nuns playing a significant role since its founding in ancient India.
* This emphasis stems from the Buddha himself being a monk, as were his earliest disciples.
* Studying monasticism is crucial to understanding the historical growth and transformation of Buddhism.

## Acquiring And Domesticating The Vinaya

* Texts dealing with Vinaya (monastic rules) are key to understanding Chinese monasticism.
* These texts shed light on monastic ethos, practices, regulatory frameworks, and institutional structures.
* Important sources include canonical Vinaya texts, commentaries, ethical precepts, biographies of eminent monks, and historical works.
* Early Chinese monks faced challenges in understanding and applying Vinaya rules due to unfamiliarity with relevant literature and cultural barriers.

* Some Chinese monks created new rules to address specific aspects of monastic life in the absence of complete Vinaya translations.
* Daoan, a prominent prelate, created three sets of rules covering incense offerings, daily practices, and repentance ceremonies.
* The translation of Vinaya texts from four Indian Buddhist schools in the early fifth century improved Chinese familiarity with monastic precepts.

* Despite the availability of canonical guidelines, Chinese monks continued to write new codes and manuals on specific aspects of monastic life.
* Examples include works by Sengqu, Chaodu, Huiguang, and Daoxuan.
* These writings reflect the acculturation and ongoing development of Buddhist monasticism in China.



# On The Spectrum Of Buddhist Practice

* Extremist movements like the Three Stages Sect emerged, rejecting traditional Buddhism and calling for abolishment of the monastic order.
* This rejection stemmed from eschatological views and a belief that traditional forms were no longer relevant.

# Sinification Of Monasticism

* Chinese monks adapted Indian monastic traditions to fit their cultural context.
* This involved modifying rules, customs, and creating new practices that resonated with Chinese social norms. 
* The process was influenced by both internal institutional pressures and external factors like political power structures.

# Balancing Tradition And Change

* Monastic communities faced a tension between preserving tradition and adapting to Chinese society.
* Some rejected alien traditions while others strictly adhered to Vinaya rules, seeing them as essential for orthodoxy.

## Rules For The Tiantai Community

* Zhiyi's *Li zhifa* provides insight into monastic life at his Tiantai monastery.
* Composed in the 6th century, it is one of the earliest extant monastic codes in China.
* It reflects broader trends in monastic development and was influential for later schools like Chan Buddhism.

* Zhiyi wrote the code due to a decline in monk behavior, contrasting it with a past where monks were more morally inclined.
* He outlines three main options for communal practice: ritual and meditation, repentance rituals, and monastic duties.




# The First and Third Options of Communal Practice

* These options are familiar from other contexts.
* The option of practicing repentance in a sanctuary is largely associated with the Tiantai tradition.

# Entry into the Monastic Community

* Individuals wishing to become members must be monks in good standing.
* They must possess appropriate robes and monastic accessories.
* They must be willing to adopt the rules and engage in religious activities pertinent to the three main types of monastic life.
* Entry is open to all monks who wish to pursue the pertinent practices.

# Daily Schedule for Monks Engaged in Communal Practice

* Monks must participate in ten periods of practice: four formal meditations and six ritual worships.
* They are not allowed to miss any of these periods.
* Punishments exist for being late or absent from required periods of practice.

# Solitary Practice in a Separate Sanctuary

* The main purpose is to dedicate oneself to contemplative practices, especially the four forms of samādhi.
* This type of intensive practice was undertaken for fixed periods (up to 90 days).
* Punishments exist for those who enter the sanctuary for the wrong reasons.

# Dietary Rules

* All members must adopt a vegetarian diet.
* This includes abstaining from meat, fish, leeks, pungent plants, and liquor.
* These rules apply everywhere monks are, even when traveling.
* The punishment for transgressing is expulsion from the monastery (except in cases of serious illness).

# Adherence to Religious Norms

* Monks who are unwilling to abide by the rules must be disciplined and punished.
* Incorrigible monks should be expelled from the monastery.




## Monastic Ideals Within Tang Chan

* Early Chan movement was closely connected with the Vinaya tradition.
* East Mountain tradition, considered an early representative of Chan school, emphasized disciplined monastic lifestyle and contemplative praxis.
* Northern School, successor to East Mountain tradition, also valued adherence to monastic precepts.
* Baotang School under Wuzhu advocated for a radical form of detachment, rejecting conventional Buddhist practices and Vinaya precepts.
* Guifeng Zongmi criticized the antinomian approach of Wuzhu and the Baotang school.

## Encounter Dialogue Stories and Hongzhou School

* Stories in encounter dialogue format, often featuring rejection or disregard of Vinaya rules, are not reliable sources for understanding Tang Chan teachings and practices.
* These stories were products of later Chan milieus (Five Dynasties and Song eras) and do not reflect the religious world of Tang Chan.
* Records from the Hongzhou School focus on different priorities, including attitudes towards monastic precepts and conventional morality.

## Guishan's Admonitions

* This text by Guishan Lingyou addresses issues of monastic discipline and observance within Chan monasteries.
* It focuses on maintaining discipline and decorum in a monastic setting that attracts individuals with diverse motivations and abilities.
* Guishan exhorts his monks to follow monastic rules, lead disciplined lives, and pursue Buddhist teachings.

## Themes in Guishan's Admonitions

* Critiques various forms of monastic impropriety and warns about karmic consequences.
* Reminds monks of exemplary images of monkhood, resonating with traditional depictions of religiosity.
* Contradicts the view that Hongzhou school rejected ethical norms and ascetic ideals of mainstream Buddhist monasticism.

# Guishan's Teachings on Monastic Life

* Guishan emphasized the importance of following the Vinaya rules established by the Buddha for a genuine religious life.
* He warned against wasting time on empty pursuits and urged dedication to the path towards spiritual liberation.
* Guishan depicted an exemplary monk as serious, sincere, and having truly left home to dedicate their life to transcendental goals.

# The Baizhang Legend And Its Resonances

* The legend of Baizhang Huaihai creating a unique system of Chan monastic rules, including manual labor as a central tenet, is widely known.
* This legend is often used to explain the economic independence of Chan monasteries and Baizhang's status as a patron saint of Chan monasticism.
* However, there is no evidence that Baizhang's rules ever existed, and the earliest references to them appear in Song dynasty texts, centuries after his death.

* Recent research suggests that the Baizhang legend likely reflects later aspirations or ideals within Chan circles rather than historical reality.
* The only potential link to Baizhang Mountain is a set of five general monastic rules inscribed on a memorial stupa, which do not mention Chan specifically.
* These findings challenge traditional views about a distinct Chan monastic system and highlight the gradual evolution of Chinese Buddhist monasticism.

* The Baizhang legend became central to narratives emphasizing the uniqueness of Chan monasticism during the Song dynasty.
* This led to the creation of various Chan monastic codes, inspired by the legend, which served as models for other Buddhist traditions.
* While these codes reflected a threefold classification of monasteries (Chan, Teaching, and Vinaya), the lines between them were not always clear-cut.

## Xuefeng'S Code For His Monastic Community

* Xuefeng Yicun (822–908) was a prominent Chan teacher and author of *Shi guizhi* (Teacher's Regulations), the earliest extant monastic code by a Chan monk.
* Xuefeng's lineage is significant in Chan/Zen circles, as his teachings influenced the Fayan and Yunmen schools.

* Xuefeng emphasized both contemplative practice and monastic discipline, evident in his 901 rules for his monastery on Xuefeng Mountain.
* These rules were inspired by those of his teacher Lingxun at Furong Mountain, suggesting a tradition of monastic codes within Chan Buddhism.

## The Content and Structure of Xuefeng's Code

* Xuefeng's code is concise, comprising an introduction, six rules, and a closing statement.
* It emphasizes the importance of monastic discipline as a path to realization.
* The code reflects traditional Vinaya values while also promoting a broad vision of Buddhism.

## Practical Concerns in Xuefeng's Code

* Rules address practical matters such as caring for sick monks, managing monastery finances (through landed estates and offerings), and assigning duties.
* Punishments are outlined for transgressions like leaving the monastery without permission.
* The code supplements existing Vinaya rules and customary practices.

## Significance of Xuefeng's Code

* While specific to Xuefeng's monastery, the code reflects common concerns shared by other monastic communities in Tang China.
* It offers insights into the organization and daily life of monasteries during this period.
* The code demonstrates a pragmatic approach to monastic discipline within Chan Buddhism.

## Concluding Remarks

* The Baizhang legend symbolizes a discontinuity with received monastic traditions but also highlights the gradual development of distinct forms of monastic life in medieval China.
* While some scholars see the shift as marking the Sinification of Buddhism, extant sources reveal a sense of continuity with the canonical tradition and established monastic order.
* Monks like Zhiyi and Xuefeng were active agents in transforming monastic practices while remaining central embodiments of Chinese Buddhist orthodoxy.

## Precept Texts As A Literary Genre

* Tadeusz Skorupski identifies two types of ritual texts for taking the vow of bodhisattva morality: those that give an outline of basic principles without concrete rules, and those with concrete rules.
* The first type is represented by Candragomin and the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*.
* Concrete rules played a crucial role in the ordination process of bodhisattvas.

## The Social And Political Context Of 5Th And 6Th Century China

* The fifth and sixth centuries were significant for the Chinese reinterpretation of Mahāyāna doctrines, particularly precepts for laypeople.
* The *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*, with commentaries by Zhiyi and Fazang, gained prominence in China, especially in the south.
* Self-ordination was a key feature of the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*.
* The *Brahmā's Net Sūtra* may have been compiled to address ideological friction between Buddhism and Confucianism.
* The sixth century saw a new relationship between the Buddhist order and laity due to monastic corruption in the north and merit accumulation desires in the south.
* This led to calls for reform, including self-ordination as a means of addressing changing circumstances. 
* Zhiyi's performance of bodhisattva precepts rituals for Sui emperors strengthened ties between Buddhism and the ruling class.




## Chan Buddhism And Bodhisattva Precepts: Textual Affinities

* **Scholars have identified connections between Chan Buddhism and bodhisattva precepts.** 
    * Paul Magnin observed a strong doctrinal connection between Daoxin's *Manual of Rules of Bodhisattva Precepts*, Jingjue's *Chronicle of the Sources of the Laṅkā Masters*, and the *Gateway to the Mahāyāna Skillful Means for Nonbirth*.

* **The *Manual* seems to be the source of a shared model for precept-conferral ceremonies used by diverse groups.**
    * The Dongshan school inherited Daoxin's teachings and had strong ties to bodhisattva precepts.

* **Early Chan Buddhism employed ordination ceremonies derived from the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*.**
    * The *Gateway*, attributed to Shenxiu, reflects ideas associated with the Dongshan school.

* **The doctrinal evolution from the *Gateway* to the Dunhuang manuscript of the *Platform* Sūtra shows key concepts regarding mind theory prevalent in Northern Chan pervaded eighth-century teachings on meditation and precepts.**
    * Śubhakarasiṃha composed his *Essentials of Meditation* by revising the *Gateway*.

* **Ennin's bibliographies provide further evidence for the connection between Chan and precepts.**
    * He grouped together texts related to bodhisattva precepts, the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, and Buddha-nature.

* **Tang literati often paired the Brahmā's Net Sūtra and the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra in biographies of Buddhist monks.**
    * Jingjue's *Chronicle* regarded the Laṅkāvatāra tradition and bodhisattva precepts as inseparable.

## The Doctrinal Context: Purification Of The Mind 

* **The concept of "purified mind" prevailed during the development of Chan Buddhism.**
    * The purification of the outflow comes from recognizing an objective world that is of the mind itself, according to the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra.

* **Meditation and precepts were two sides of the same coin in the process of achieving purification of the mind.**
    * According to the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*, repentance and meditation are prerequisites for receiving bodhisattva precepts.

* **The *Gateway* explains that bodhisattva precepts are "mind-precepts" with Buddha-nature as their essence.**
    * It emphasizes purity gained through repentance as a requirement for receiving pure precepts.

* **The precept conferral procedure outlined in the *Gateway* highlights the importance of repentance, meditation, and the perfection of wisdom in purifying the mind.** 
    * This process prepares practitioners to receive the precepts of the mind.

## Purification Of The Mind In The Three Clusters Of Pure Precepts

* This section discusses the emergence of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and bodhisattva precepts in early Mahāyāna Buddhism in China.
* It highlights the Chinese master Zhiyi's classification system that positioned the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra as the Buddha's last sermon, addressing inconsistencies within Buddhist teachings.

* The debate on Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna precepts led to the concept of *kaihui*, where the Vinaya could be transformed into Mahāyāna precepts by combining it with bodhisattva vows.
* This section explains how the adoption of Hīnayāna precepts supported the bodhisattva precepts, illustrated through the "three clusters of pure precepts" (prevention of evil, promotion of good, salvation of sentient beings).

* It emphasizes the connection between these three clusters and the purification of the mind, drawing parallels with Esoteric Buddhist doctrines.
* The section highlights how meditation and precept conferral are inseparable in practice for achieving a purified mind.

* This section explores the importance of the "mind of enlightenment" (*bodhicitta*) in receiving bodhisattva precepts according to Esoteric Buddhism.
* It cites texts like Śubhākarasiṃha's *Essentials of Meditation* and Amoghavajra's *Zuishang shengjiao shoufa puti xinjie chanhui wen*, emphasizing repentance as crucial for purifying the mind before receiving precepts.

* This section draws parallels between the emphasis on mind purification in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and the Brahmā's Net Sūtra.
* It explains how the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra connects the perfection of morality to a state of non-discrimination, achieved through well-controlled consciousness and understanding emptiness.

* This section highlights the Brahmā's Net Sūtra's claim that all sentient beings inherently possess pure precepts and can attain Buddhahood upon receiving Mahāyāna precepts.
* It mentions the concept of self-ordination arising from the belief that purest precepts can be conferred simply through comprehending dharma masters' words.

* This section discusses the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra's "nonvehicle" and "one-vehicle" theory, aligning with the Lotus Sūtra's concept of "oneness" and "one-vehicle."
* It explains how the term "supreme vehicle" (*zuishang sheng*) often appears alongside "single mind," referring to the Mahāyāna bodhisattva path.

* This section outlines three interpretive lines of the "supreme vehicle": Esoteric tradition's emphasis on initiation rituals, Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra's focus on realizing "perfect realization of own-nature," and Southern Chan's association with sudden enlightenment through *prajñā*.
* It concludes by stating that these interpretations do not challenge the fundamental presumption of the bodhisattva approach.

# Evolution Of Purification Of The Mind

* This section explores how Chan Buddhism incorporated bodhisattva precepts into its ideology.
* It analyzes texts like the *Platform Sūtra*, *Gateway*, and *Platform Dialogue*, highlighting their focus on ordination rituals and the simplification of precepts for a wider audience.
* The shift from "mind precepts" to "formless precepts" is discussed, emphasizing the influence of the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*.

# From Mind Precepts to the Formless Precepts in the Platform Sūtra

* This section focuses on the social functions of the *Platform Sūtra* and its increasing importance in eighth-century Chan Buddhism.
* It argues that the shift from the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* to the *Platform Sūtra* was driven by social and political factors rather than doctrinal differences.

* The *Platform Sūtra* is presented as a response to the growing number of lay followers and the need for a simplified ordination ritual.
* It emphasizes the "formless precepts," which could be conferred more easily on a larger audience, reflecting a trend towards accessibility in Buddhism.

* The text's emphasis on the *Platform Sūtra* itself as a conduit for receiving precepts from Huineng is highlighted, demonstrating a shift in the relationship between clergy and laity.
* The section concludes by suggesting that the *Platform Sūtra*'s success was partly due to its alignment with the political climate of the time, particularly Emperor Xuanzong's religious policies.

# During the Kaiyuan Era

* Shenhui emerged as the seventh Chan patriarch during a time of prosperity.
* Emperor Xuanzong's policies favored Shenhui's teachings.
* Xuanzong restricted translation activities, which disadvantaged scholar monks who relied on Sanskrit scriptures.
* He showed hostility towards Indian monks, leading to fewer translations from Sanskrit originals.

# The Influence of Imperial Patronage 

* Xuanzong's religious policy encouraged confidence among Chinese Buddhists in their traditions.
* Despite his strict policies, Xuanzong was interested in certain Buddhist sutras, including the *Diamond Sūtra* and the *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra for Humane Kings*.
* The promotion of these texts coincided with Shenhui's campaign to elevate the *Diamond Sūtra*, which aligned with Mādhyamaka doctrines.
* Xuanzong's patronage influenced Buddhist discourse in ninth-century China, favoring the *Diamond Sūtra* over the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra*.

# Doctrinal and Textual Affiliation

* The essay explores Mahāyāna precepts, focusing on the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra* and its influence on Chinese perceptions.
* It examines the spread of bodhisattva precepts in southern China and their adaptation for lay communities.
* The emphasis on simplified precepts for the laity coincided with a growing focus on inward-looking practices.

# The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and the Brahmā's Net Sūtra

* Both sutras emphasize mind precepts and inward-looking practice as central to Buddhist teachings.
* The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* links pure minds with non-transgression of precepts, achieved through controlled consciousness and understanding emptiness.
* This aligns with the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*'s message of eliminating illusions for spiritual purification.

# The Emergence of Formless Precepts

* The essay traces the development of "formless precepts" within the context of Chan Buddhism.
* It analyzes texts associated with the Platform Sūtra to understand how interpretations of bodhisattva precepts evolved.
* Mind purification is identified as a key concept connecting the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* and the *Brahmā's Net Sūtra*.

# Conclusion


* The study highlights the fusion of concepts in Buddhist texts, leading to the synthesis of Chan ideology and bodhisattva precepts.
* It emphasizes the importance of mind purification in both sutras and its role in shaping early Chan Buddhism.
* The analysis provides a framework for understanding the significance of "formless precepts" within the broader context of Chinese Buddhist history.

## Investigating the Implementation of Individual Regulations

# Legislating Consent: Dispute, Accord, And The Vote In Early Indian Monasticisms1

**Daniel M. Stuart**

## Introduction

This chapter explores procedural law in early Buddhist disciplinary literature as an entry point for understanding the operative modes of authority and the underpinnings of legislative thought in Buddhist monasticisms. Through a study of procedures for settling disputes or litigation (adhikaraṇaś*amatha*), the author argues for a vision of power within early Buddhist communities that prioritized community cohesion against individual needs, personal rights, or exchange of ideas.

The author suggests that these issues get played out around a central tension in Buddhist monastic law and social life: the tension between legislative authority as originally unilateral and monocratic—a series of decrees issued by the sovereign Buddha—and a social context in which dissenting forces demand to be allowed expression. 

Taking as his particular focus procedures for conflict resolution involving a majority vote (yadbhūyaiṣīya) of the monastic community, the author suggests that we can locate inclinations towards two alternate modes of legislative discourse in Buddhist disciplinary thought by looking at two distinct but related models of monastic voting.


* **First Model:** Allows for only one side to prevail.
* **Second Model:** Leaves open the possibility of a settlement in which either side prevails.

These alternative models of monastic voting, which likely have a basis in actual social practices, parallel two alternate interpretive frameworks in legal anthropology:

* **First Interpretation:** Sees procedures for settling disputes as primarily driven by a need for restoring peace and social harmony.
* **Second Interpretation:** Understands such procedures to serve an agonistic function, motivated by the pursuit of justice and fairness. 


While the procedures engaged here generally fit better with the first interpretation, the diversity of approaches found in our sources blurs the boundaries between the two strands of interpretation. The vote of the monastic community is a last resort in cases of particularly problematic community disagreements, and the primary purpose of a vote is without a doubt to bring the community back into a state of cohesion and harmony. Yet how the voting is theorized—as a publicly performed procedure that involves active participation of the entire community, not just silent consent—suggests that the acting out of conflict is also at play. 


## The Question Of Monastic "Democracy"

* Discusses whether the term "democracy" is appropriate for describing the political structure of early Buddhist monastic communities.
* Questions the applicability of modern democratic ideals to ancient Buddhist contexts, particularly regarding voting procedures outlined in Vinaya literature.
* Argues that the concept of "democracy" may obscure the coercive power dynamics present within these communities.

## The Buddha's Authority and Monastic Governance

* Challenges Steven Collins' assertion that early Buddhist monastic communities lacked a central authority figure like a "Pope."
* Emphasizes the supreme legislative authority of the Buddha, who is seen as an embodiment of Dharma.
* Suggests that the theoretical framework of Buddhist legal thought is rooted in "authoritarian fiat" rather than democratic principles.

## Early Indian Political Models and Buddhist Communities

* Explores the historical context of pre-Mauryan Indian political organization, which included both monarchical and republican models.
* Analyzes how these models have been used to understand the political structure of early Buddhist communities.
* Argues that while the narrative of a democratic Buddhist community is compelling, it overlooks the hierarchical and coercive aspects of monastic life.

## The Tension Between Monarchical and Oligarchic Authority

* Highlights the tension between the monarchical authority of the Buddha and the oligarchic nature of the monastic assembly.
* Suggests that this tension manifests in moments of dispute, leading to the use of majority vote as a means of resolving conflict. 





## The Context

* This study examines the procedure of majority vote within Buddhist ecclesiastical law.
* It draws on six extant complete Buddhist monastic legal codes (Vinayas) and some commentarial literature.
* Four categories of disputes are identified in these sources: litigation arising from dispute, accusation, offence, and formal acts of the community.

## The Sūtra Definition Of Yadbhūyaiṣīya (Will Of The Majority)

* A short sūtra, the Sāmagāmasutta, also lists the four forms of dispute and seven forms of conflict resolution found in Vinaya texts.
* It describes "will of the majority" as a process where monks gather to settle disputes by drawing out a guideline of dharma.
* If local monks cannot resolve a dispute, they should go to a larger gathering and thresh out a guideline of dharma there.




## A Problem With Presence

* This section discusses a story from the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Adhikaraṇavastu* about Kāla Mṛgāraputra's wrongful suspension from the monastic community and his subsequent reinstatement by the Buddha.
* The story highlights the importance of presence in Buddhist legal proceedings, as accusations and formal actions should be carried out in the presence of the accused.

## The Buddha as Lawgiver

* This section analyzes the narrative implications of the Buddha's unilateral authority in reinstating Kāla Mṛgāraputra without any formal procedure.
* It argues that this depiction reveals a fundamental reliance on the Buddha's absolute power within Buddhist legal systems, akin to a monarch or ruler.




## Proxies And Institutions

* The passage discusses how Buddhist legal systems address the absence of the Buddha by appointing proxies for him.
* It highlights the Mūlasarvāstivāda narrative detailing the settlement of disputes through presence and majority vote.
* The story emphasizes the role of leading monks as impartial arbitrators in local communities.

* This system reflects an oligarchic structure where learned elders hold significant influence, acting as proxies for the Buddha.
* While presented as a response to a new situation, the narrative reveals a pre-existing hierarchical monastic structure with multiple levels of appeal for dispute resolution.

## The Procedure Of Majority Vote: Two Strands Among Diverse Vinaya Traditions

* This section examines Vinaya texts and their prescriptions for voting as a last resort in resolving monastic conflicts.
* It identifies two main strands within these traditions regarding the outcome of votes.
* The first strand, represented by Theravāda, Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, and Mahāsāṅghika Vinayas, allows only proponents of *dharma* (Buddhist teachings) to prevail.

* The second strand, exemplified by Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, permits the possibility of either *dharma* or *adharma* (unwholesome norms) proponents winning.
* This section focuses primarily on Mūlasarvāstivāda and Theravāda materials due to their availability in Indic languages.

## The Vote Facilitator

* **The Vote Facilitator:**
    * Voting (śalā*kāgrahaṇa*) was intended as a last resort when consensus among monks fails.
    * This occurs when monks exhibit five qualities: cruelty, maliciousness, vehemence, intent to cause schism, and intransigence.
    * A vote facilitator (śalākācārako bhikṣuḥ) with high moral standards is appointed to oversee the process.

* **The Ideal Vote Facilitator:**
    * The criteria for a vote facilitator are stringent, requiring impartiality and freedom from emotional defilements.
    * This ideal reflects the Buddhist concept of an impartial judge, mirroring the Buddha's omniscience and lack of bias.
    * This model reinforces traditional hierarchical power structures, with a learned individual holding an objective understanding of dharma.

* **The Theravāda Perspective:**
    * The Theravādada *Samathakkhandhaka* offers a similar definition of voting procedures.
    * A vote facilitator should be able to discern the emotional states of other monks and determine their eligibility for impartial voting.
    * This reinforces the notion of the facilitator as a proxy for the Buddha, possessing near-superhuman abilities.

* **Finality of Decisions:**
    * Both traditions emphasize the finality of decisions made through voting.
    * Reopening a settled dispute is considered a pā*cittiya* offense, highlighting the weight and irreversibility of such decisions.

* **Common Traditions:**
    * Both Mūlasarvāstivāda and Theravāda traditions share a core understanding of voting procedures.
    * The need for a hierarchically idealized vote facilitator and the use of voting as a last resort are common themes.

## Voting Methods

* Three methods of voting are presented: secret voting, ear-whispered voting, and public voting.
* The vote distributor plays a crucial role in ensuring that the outcome favors the *dharma* faction, even if it means manipulating the process.
* These practices highlight a performative aspect of voting where the goal is to solidify a predetermined outcome rather than reflecting a genuine majority view.

## Buddhaghosa's Commentary

* The commentary on the Theravāda tradition explicitly describes vote rigging as an ethical practice when it serves to uphold the *dharma*.
* It emphasizes that such practices are necessary for the welfare of the community and do not conflict with ideals of "equality" or "fairness".

## Other Traditions

* Similar voting procedures are found in other Buddhist traditions, like the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, and Mahāsāṅghika.
* These traditions also prioritize ensuring an outcome favorable to the *dharma* faction.
* The Mahāsāṅghika-vinaya provides detailed instructions on manipulating voting procedures, including dismissing assemblies and summoning monks from other monasteries to sway the vote.

## Implications

* The primary purpose of these voting procedures seems to be maintaining a unified front that conforms with established doctrinal and disciplinary norms.
* The ideal is not necessarily representing an unmediated majority view but rather achieving agreement through silence or being silenced.
* These practices suggest that consent in this context is more about conforming to authority than expressing individual preferences.

# The Voting Procedures

* The text discusses voting procedures within Buddhist monastic communities, specifically focusing on the Theravāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda traditions.
* It argues against characterizing these procedures as stemming from a "general spirit of democracy," instead suggesting they aim to maintain status quo and prevent community division.

# Four Methods of Voting in Mūlasarvāstivāda Tradition

* The *Adhikaraṇavastu* of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya outlines four voting methods: concealed, public, ear-whispered, and involving the entire monastic community.
* Each method is tailored to specific demographic situations within the community, aiming to secure a victory for the *dharma* faction.

# Results of Voting

* The text presents two types of voting sticks: *dharma* (straight, even, attractive) and *adharma* (crooked, uneven, unattractive).
* A vote-facilitating monk praises the *dharma* stick and denigrates the *adharma* stick.
* If a monk repeatedly chooses the *adharma* stick, it is considered a minor offense (*duṣkṛta*).

# Analysis

* The Mūlasarvāstivāda voting procedures are more sophisticated and nuanced than those in other traditions.
* They involve a degree of coercion through manipulation of social hierarchy and aesthetic appeal.
* Notably, the *Adhikaraṇavastu* allows for the possibility of the *adharma* faction winning, highlighting a potential for dissent within the monastic community.

# These unabashed methods of coercion in the voting process are remarkable

* The voting process is biased towards the *dharma* faction.
* Despite this bias, the vote can be settled in favor of either the *dharma* or *adharma* faction.
* The aim of the voting procedure is to settle disputes definitively.
* These procedures also function as opportunities for public displays of hierarchical power and agonistic ideals.

# What are we to make of these methods of settling litigation arising from dispute?

* Buddhist monastic legal acts rest on an ideal of "agreement by silence."
* Access to participation as a legal person opens the door for dispute.
* Hindu legal procedure is based on a conflictual paradigm that serves as a means for the execution of *dharma*.
* Conflict has a role to play in these procedures, and the basic human urge to competition can be channeled in various directions.

# The performative nature of the voting ritual allows for dispute to do the work of the *dharma*

* While the expressed goal is a settlement with a focus on equity, the language of victory reveals another side of these procedures.
* Legal procedure in general may serve a more agonistic purpose, allowing for an unfortunate outcome that is nonetheless representative.
* The (Mūla-)sarvāstivāda strand of these procedures may have been influenced by dharmaśāstric conceptions of law and conflict.

# When we take all the Vinaya voting procedures into account

* A settled dispute, even in the name of the *adharma*, allows business as usual to continue.
* This includes communal recitations, ritual confession, legal acts of a unified community, and additional procedures to negotiate conflict.

# Pāṃśukūlika As A Standard Practice In The Vinaya

* This chapter challenges the scholarly view that ascetic practices were marginal to Indian Buddhist monastic communities during the middle period.
* It examines evidence from the *Vinaya* to argue that the ascetic practice of pāṃśukūlika (wearing refuse fabric) was a standard practice in these communities.

# Methodological Orientation

* The chapter aims to demonstrate that *Vinaya* narratives can be read as witnesses to social realities, not just representations of monastic jurists' positions.
* It will use the concept of "standard practices" - behaviors recognized by monastic jurists as common and significant enough to be mentioned incidentally or targeted by legislation.

# Recent Scholarship on Asceticism in Buddhism

* Scholars generally believe that ascetic practices like pāṃśukūlika were more prevalent in early Buddhism and became marginalized by the time the *Vinaya* was compiled.
* Gregory Schopen argues that monastic jurists intended to curb and marginalize such practices, focusing specifically on the acquisition of robe material from cemeteries (śmāśānika).

# Testing Whether Pāṃśukūlika Was a Standard Practice

* This section will analyze specific passages from the *Vinaya* to determine whether pāṃśukūlika should be considered a standard practice.
* The analysis will focus on the frequency and context of mentions of pāṃśukūlika, as well as the attitudes towards it expressed by monastic jurists.





# Methodological Orientation
* Several methodological approaches exist for reading Vinaya case narratives to determine the extent to which a practice was standard.
* One approach views Vinaya rulings as representative of historical shifts away from banned practices.
* Another approach focuses on "incidental mention" of items unrelated to the author's primary agenda, using them as evidence of social realities.
* The "principle of counterargument" suggests that legal repression indicates a practice was popular among monks.

#  A fourth and final method is to utilize *Vinaya* cases in order to articulate the views of the authors and compilers of the *Vinaya*. 




## Scholarly Conceptions Of The Role Of Asceticism In Indian Buddhism Of The Middle Period

* The term "asceticism" is derived from the Greek word "askesis," initially meaning "training."
* Modern European scholars, including Max Weber, used the term to categorize South Asian religious practices similar to those in classical pagan and Christian contexts. 
* This categorization relied on a Weberian conception of the "other-worldly" religious figure, who leads through charisma based on ascetic practice.

## The Weberian Model and Its Application to Buddhism

* Weber's model posits two stages in religious community development: a charismatic stage led by an ascetic figure and a bureaucratic stage characterized by institutionalization.
* Scholars often apply this model to Buddhism, viewing the *parivrājaka* as representative of the charismatic stage and monastic institutions as the bureaucratic stage.

## The Role of Asceticism in the Vinaya

* The Weberian model relegates ascetic practice to the proto-historic Buddhist monasticism characterized by a *parivrājaka* master and his disciples.
* Most scholars believe the *Vinaya* was produced during a mature institutional phase, suggesting that ascetic practices within it are vestigial remnants of an earlier period.

## Schopen's Perspective on Ascetic Practices

* Gregory Schopen argues that ascetic practices like the *niśrayas* and *dhūtaguṇas* were largely rhetorical in the *Vinaya*, not reflecting actual monastic life.
* He suggests that these practices became problematic for *Vinaya* compilers due to concerns about public perception and Brahmanical ritual sensibilities.




## The Continuing Social Logic For Pāṃśukūlika In The Mature Monastic Institution

* The text challenges the idea of a linear transition from ascetic practices like *pāṃśukūlika* to bureaucratic monasticism.
* It cites the *Vinaya*, which narrates instances where monks continue to obtain robes through informal networks even after the establishment of a formal donation system.
* These instances highlight the ongoing necessity for monks to practice *pāṃśukūlika* despite the presence of a mature monastic institution.

## Skepticism of Assumptions About Monastic Development

* Some scholars argue against a clear division between itinerant and settled lifestyles in early Buddhism.
* They suggest that both styles coexisted, with monks engaging in both wandering and residing in monasteries.
* The process of "domestication" of the monk was complex and involved cycles of interaction between monks and laity.

## A Case Study from the *Vibhaṅga*

* This case illustrates a monk practicing *pāṃśukūlika* in a city, highlighting the challenges he faces.
* The monk searches for discarded clothing but is ultimately accused of stealing laundered clothes.
* The ruling focuses on the monk's lack of awareness about proper conduct within a town or village rather than condemning *pāṃśukūlika* itself.

##  Public Nature and Challenges of Pāṃśukūlika

* The case study emphasizes that *pāṃśukūlika* is a public act with the potential for social embarrassment.
* It highlights the need for monks to navigate complex social situations while adhering to their ascetic practices.

## Donor Attitudes And The Locale Of The Refuse Heap (Pāṃśukūla)

* Scholars argue that the corporate identity of the monastic community became increasingly important, influencing protocols of behavior and standards of ritual pollution.
* A passage from the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣ*ajyavastu* discusses a monk turned away by a patron due to his unkempt appearance and disreputable robes, highlighting concerns about the image projected by monks.

* The Vinaya authorities permit the practice of pāṃśukūlika (using discarded materials for robes) but express reservations about its public perception.
* A passage from the Cī*varavastu* of the Dharmaguptaka-vinaya depicts a monk collecting filthy old fabric from a waste pile, and a donor compassionately provides him with ritually degraded fine material.

* This case demonstrates an understanding of pāṃśukūlika practice and a desire to respect its requirements while still offering assistance.
* Another passage from the same text describes a householder placing fine fabric in latrine areas for monks, indicating an awareness of the need for the robes to be ritually impure.

* These cases suggest that donors encouraged monks to violate the spirit of pāṃśukūlika by providing them with "donated" material disguised as found objects.
* The donors' actions imply a belief that monks were expected to acquire robes from refuse piles, and they sought to ensure that the practice continued despite their own generosity.

* The Vinaya jurists allowed for both classic pāṃśukūlika (foraging for scraps) and a more lenient form involving donated material treated to resemble found-objects.
* Donors' respect for the authenticity of the practice suggests that the ritually impure nature of some monks' robes was accepted as standard.

## Pāṃśukūlika And The Cemetery

* The connection between monks practicing *pāṃśukūlika* and the cult of the dead is evident in *Vinaya* texts, particularly the *Dharmaguptaka-vinaya*.

* Two competing ritual attitudes influenced the relationship between *pāṃśukūlika* monks and the dead:
    * The desire to separate the world of the living from the dead through purification rites.
    * The ancient Indian belief in caring for ancestors to ensure their positive influence on the community.

* Buddhist monks were sometimes seen as ritual specialists capable of mediating between the living and the dead, benefiting the community.

##  The Socially "Dangerous" Ascetic Practice

* Schopen argues that *Vinaya* compilers sought to protect the image of the Buddhist order by restricting *śmāśānika* practices (contact with the dead), which could lead to ritual pollution and accusations of stealing from the dead.
* Many *Vinaya* cases involving *pāṃśukūlika* reflect concerns about public criticism and adherence to societal norms regarding property and ritual propriety.

## The Role of Monks in the Cult of the Dead

* Despite potential negative perceptions, monks played a vital role in the funeral complex and ancestor cult by:
    * Presiding over funerals.
    * Reciting texts for the deceased.
    * Consoling relatives.
    * Ensuring the deceased's smooth transition to the afterlife.

* The *Śaikṣa* precepts in the *Dharmaguptaka-vinaya* document monks' involvement in transporting, burying, and cremating corpses.

* Archaeological evidence suggests families expected a better rebirth for their deceased relatives interred near *stūpas*.


## Monks as Spiritual Intercessors

* While some viewed monks engaging in *śmāśānika* practices as ritually polluted or property infringers, others recognized their role as indispensable spiritual intercessors between the living and the dead.
* The intensity of *śmāśānika* practices was believed to enhance a monk's ability to navigate the relationship between the living and the dead.

## Evidence from Modern Anthropology

* Kamala Tiyavanich's study of Thai *thudong* monks suggests that residing in cemeteries granted them immunity to impurity and the power to quell restless spirits, reinforcing their role as mediators.

##  Interpreting Vinaya Narratives

* *Vinaya* rulings can be interpreted from two perspectives:
    * The perspective of monastic jurists seeking to ban offensive behaviors.
    * The perspective of a subculture of standard *pāṃśukūlika* practices, evidenced by Nattier's "principle of counterargument."

* Rulings against *pāṃśukūlika* can be seen as evidence of its existence and social reality among certain monks.

## Summary

**Passage E**

* A group of householders see a monk taking fabric that they had adorned their family stūpa with as an offering to their deceased relatives.
* They complain to the Buddha, who rules that monks should not take such items unless they have been blown or carried away by natural forces.
* This case reveals that while some monks practiced pāṃśukūlika (collecting discarded fabric), it was a contentious practice and subject to community scrutiny.

**Passage F**

* Two pāṃśukūlika monks encounter householders cremating a corpse in the cemetery.
* One monk receives a fine piece of material from the householders, leading to a dispute with his fellow monk over whether they should share it.
* The Buddha rules that the monks should ask the householder who the clothing was intended for and divide it accordingly.

**Analysis:**

* These cases demonstrate that pāṃśukūlika practices were common enough to be assumed in legal narratives. 
* They highlight the tension between the practice of collecting discarded fabric and the expectations of proper ritual propriety held by some lay Buddhists.
* The quality of the fabric received could influence how monks shared it, potentially straining their fellowship.

# There were two pāṃś*ukūlika* monks.

* Two monks vowed to share any p*āṃśukū*la they obtained.
* One monk broke the vow after finding a fine piece of p*āṃśukū*la.
* Breaking this pact was considered a pā*rājika* offense.

# The Distinction Between *pāṃśukūla* and Fine Material

* Monks sought out *pāṃśukū*la but often received higher quality donated material instead.
* This fine material caused conflict among monks who had pacts to share *pāṃśukū*la.
* The rarity of the fine material suggests that practicing pāṃśukū*lika* was customary.

# Pacts Among Monks

* Passages F and G indicate pacts, formal or informal, among monks to collect and share *pāṃśukū*la*.
* These pacts were significant enough to be policed by monastic jurists.

# Cases Involving Cemetery Acquisition

* The following cases involve monks going to cemeteries to obtain *pāṃśukū*la.
* There is no indication that the fabric was donated by householders.

# Case H: Two Monks Fighting Over *pāṃśukū*la

* Two monks saw p*āṃśukū*la in a cemetery and raced to claim it.
* The Buddha ruled that the monk who took it first owned it.
* This case reinforces the impression that no householders were involved.

# Case I: Monks Taking P*āṃśukū*la From a Pile

* A monk gathered p*āṃśukū*la but left it, intending to return later.
* Other monks took the fabric, believing it was ownerless.
* The Buddha ruled that while not stealing, they should not take gathered p*āṃśukū*la.

# Case J: Monks Arguing Over Shared *pāṃśukū*la

* Monks saw householders burying a corpse and anticipated finding p*āṃśukū*la.
* One monk went alone and obtained a lot of fabric.
* The other monks demanded a share, leading to an argument.
* The Buddha ruled that the monk who retrieved it owned it.



#  The Nature of *pāṃśukū*la

* When p*āṃśukū*la is not donated but found by monks, what does it specifically refer to?
* To what extent are social norms regarding ritual pollution and property breached when monks retrieve p*āṃśukū*la from cemeteries themselves?

# The Practice of Pāṃśukūlika in Early Buddhist Monasteries

* This section investigates whether instances of pāṃśukūlika appearing in the Vinaya can be considered standard practices.
* It argues that scholarly orientation often relegates ascetic practices to a period before monasteries became mature institutions, confining them to the margins.
* The focus is on the social realities of pāṃśukūlika practice rather than solely on monastic jurists' verdicts.

#  The Persistence of Parivrājaka Lifestyle

* This section argues that the parivrājaka lifestyle, associated with ascetic practices like pāṃśukūlika, continued even after monasteries matured.
* It cites passages from the Vinaya indicating monks struggled to acquire pāṃśukūla for robes, suggesting ongoing practice.
* Cases of monks practicing pāṃśukūlika in refuse heaps are discussed, highlighting its acceptance despite potential ritual impurity.

#  The Cemetery as a Site for Pāṃśukūlika

* This section focuses on the cemetery as a primary location for obtaining pāṃśukūla material, noting its emphasis in Vinaya traditions.
* It acknowledges varying views within different Vinayas regarding cemetery fabric (śmāśānika) and its permissibility.
* While some Vinayas are more permissive, limitations exist on the types of situations where śmāśānika cloth can be used.

#  Evidence for Standard Practice

* This section analyzes passages from the Dharmaguptaka-vinaya suggesting monks engaged in pāṃśukūlika within their legal rights, even with potential corpse contact.
* It argues that these monks likely retrieved material directly from corpses, indicating extreme forms of practice.
* The enthusiasm of monks for cemetery fabric suggests it was still in contact with corpses, defying attempts to limit the practice.

# Concluding Thoughts

* This section summarizes the argument that pāṃśukūlika constituted a subculture within early Buddhist monasteries despite efforts by some Vinaya jurists to restrict it.
* It emphasizes the use of Nattier's interpretive techniques to highlight details suggesting the continued existence and potential flourishing of this practice under a legal framework.

## Analytical Study Of The Monks' Pācittiya 波逸提 Rules

* This paper examines historical changes in the *pātimokkha*, a set of rules for Buddhist monks, focusing on articles 21-24 concerning interactions between monks and nuns.
* The author emphasizes the importance of studying the Vinayapiṭaka (a collection of monastic rules) to understand the history of Buddhism.

* The Vinayapiṭaka acts as a historical record because it is maintained consistently within each monastic community.

* Articles 21-24 were established due to incidents involving inappropriate behavior by monks towards nuns.
* These articles restrict monks from exhorting nuns in their quarters except in cases of illness, highlighting the importance of proper boundaries and conduct between monks and nuns.




## Ii

* The Mahīśā*saka-vinaya* has articles similar to the *Mahāvihāra-vinaya* regarding monks exhorting nuns.
* However, there is a discrepancy in the Mahīśāsaka-vinaya* about whether monks need approval from the Saṃgha to go to nuns' quarters for exhortation.
* The Mahīśā*saka-vinaya* suggests that monks were permitted to go to nuns' quarters to exhort, which differs from the *Mahāvihāra-vinaya*.

## Iii

* The Mahāsāṃ*ghika-vinaya* articles are similar to those in the *Mahāvihāra-vinaya* and *Mahīśāsaka-vinaya*.
* However, it allows monks to go to nuns' quarters if they have addressed another monk there.
* Both the Mahāsāṃ*ghika-vinaya* and the Mahīśā*saka-vinaya* acknowledge both situations: monks going to nuns' quarters and nuns going to monks' quarters for exhortation.

## Iv

* The *Dharmaguptaka-vinaya*, unlike the previous three, does not have a *sikkhāpada* stating that monks must not go to nuns' quarters to exhort.
* Both situations (monks going to nuns' quarters and nuns going to monks' quarters) occur in the *Dharmaguptaka-vinaya*. 

## V

* The *Sarvāstivāda-vinaya* has articles similar to those in the *Mahāvihāra-vinaya*, prohibiting monks from exhorting nuns without approval and after sunset.
* It also prohibits monks from speaking ill of other monks who exhort nuns for gain.





## Vi

* This section discusses the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya and its unique wording regarding monks exhorting nuns.
* Article 21 of this vinaya allows for exhortation by monks who have appropriate dharma even without Saṃgha approval, a difference from other vinayas.
* The inclusion of this wording is justified by a story about the Cūḷapanthaka, suggesting a deliberate modification.

## Vii

* Six Vinayapiṭakas are compared, revealing variations in articles 21-24 (pācittiya) regarding monks and nuns.
* These differences highlight historical changes within the Vinaya tradition.
* It is important to avoid forcing these differing accounts into a single interpretation, instead recognizing their distinct origins.

## Introduction

* This chapter examines the historical and legal background surrounding the revival of the *bhikkhunī* order in the Theravāda tradition.
* A central aspect is the sense of identity of Theravāda monastics, defined by adherence to the Pāli Vinaya rules.
* The goal is to present a balanced picture of whether reviving the *bhikkhunī* order is legally possible from the viewpoint of the Pāli Vinaya.

## 1 A Brief History Of The Bhikkhunī Order The Founding Of The Order Of Bhikkhunīs

* This section summarizes the depiction in the Pāli Vinaya of the founding of the *bhikkhunī* order, not attempting to reconstruct historical events.
* The Buddha founded the order at the request of his foster mother Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī after initially refusing.
* Eight "principles to be respected" (*garudhamma*) were established, delineating the subordinate position of *bhikkhunīs*.

## 2 The Transmission Of Bhikkhunī Ordination To Sri Lanka

* According to the Dī*pavaṃsa*, Mahinda brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE.
* He explained that *bhikkhu*s couldn't ordain women, so *bhikkhunī* Saṅghamittā arrived with a group of *bhikkhunīs* to ordain the queen and her following.

## 3 The Transmission Of Bhikkhunī Ordination To China

* Chinese sources report that Sri Lankan *bhikkhunīs* travelled to China in the early 5th century CE, finding monks were ordaining women.
* Another group arrived four years later, forming a quorum for full ordination of over three hundred candidates.
* The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya was imposed on all monastics in China by imperial decree in the 8th century.

## 4 The Extinction Of The Bhikkhunī Order In India And Sri Lanka

* Inscriptional evidence shows the *bhikkhunī* lineage continued in India until the 8th century and in Sri Lanka until the 11th century.
* The decline in India may be linked to a decrease in urbanism, while political turmoil likely led to its end in Sri Lanka.




## 2 Key Elements Of Theravāda Monasticism The Term Theravāda
* The term "Theravāda" originates from Pāli discourse and initially meant "sayings of the elders."
* It later came to represent teachings compiled by elders at the first saṅgīti, a communal recitation of Buddha's teachings.

## The Theravāda Vinaya
* The *Vinaya*, containing rules and regulations believed to be from the Buddha, holds a central place in Theravāda identity.
* The *Vinaya* is considered unalterable, with procedures based on laws pronounced in the past.
* Elders hold authority in interpreting these rules, exemplified by Mahākassapa's role in the first saṅgīti.

## Key Elements Of Theravāda Ordination
* Correct performance of ordination procedures prescribed in the *Vinaya* is crucial for becoming a Theravāda monastic.
* Establishing the ritual boundary (sīmā) and using correct Pāli liturgical language are essential elements.
* Fictive names like Nāga and Tissa are used to avoid pronunciation errors during the ceremony.

## Theravāda Legalism
* Strict adherence to rules extends beyond ordination, impacting daily monastic life.
* Restrictions on accepting gold/silver and engaging in financial transactions pose challenges in modern times.
* Some strict Theravāda monks choose to stay in Mahāyāna monasteries to avoid potential legal issues arising from the use of money by other monks.

## Theravāda And Dharmaguptaka

* The legal codes for *bhikkhunīs* differ between the Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka traditions.
* Differences exist in the formulation of rules, particularly regarding *pārajika* and *pācittiya* offenses.
* Legal acts require different languages: Pāli for Theravāda and Chinese for Dharmaguptaka.

* The process of establishing the ordination boundary (*sīmā*) differs between the two traditions.
* Different markers and formulas are used, making ordinations conducted by one tradition invalid in the eyes of the other.


## 3 Theravāda Eight And Ten Precept Nuns The Four Assemblies And The Eight And Ten Precepts

* Buddhist communities traditionally consist of four assemblies (*parisā*): *bhikkhu*s, *bhikkhunīs*, male lay followers, and female lay followers.
* Due to the absence of *bhikkhunīs* in Theravāda South and Southeast Asia, three-assembly models emerged.

* Eight and ten precept nuns have arisen in Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, and the West as substitutes for the *bhikkhunī* lineage.
* The ten precepts are identical to those taken by novices (sāmaṇera and sāmaṇerī). 
* The eight precepts combine the seventh and eighth ten precepts and omit the tenth.

## Mae Chi In Thailand

* *Mae chi* tradition in Thailand is the oldest among eight and ten precept nuns in Theravāda countries.
* They wear white attire, similar to laywomen on religious observance days.
* Ordination usually involves taking eight precepts, and they retain their lay names.

* Unlike *bhikkhu*s, *mae chi*s do not receive free medical treatment or public transport. 
* Their monastic dwellings lack typical monastery structures, making their "monastic" nature dependent on conduct rather than architecture.
* Some *mae chi*s have achieved prominence through learning and spiritual attainment.

## Thila Shins In Myanmar

* *Thila shin*s wear colored monastic attire, typically pink, distinguishing them from both laity and *bhikkhu*s.

* They do not officiate at public ceremonies or preach, similar to laywomen in the eyes of *bhikkhu*s.
* Unlike *bhikkhu*s who beg for ready-to-eat food daily, *thila shin*s only beg on special occasions and receive uncooked rice.

* Taking ten precepts is rare among *thila shin*s as it requires wealthy supporters to handle their financial needs.
* Their status falls short of enabling a life of renunciation comparable to ancient *bhikkhunīs*.

## Dasasil Mātās In Sri Lanka

* The *dasasil mātā* tradition in Sri Lanka is the youngest, originating from a Sri Lankan who trained as a *thila shin* in Myanmar.
* They wear plain cloth robes similar in color to those of *bhikkhu*s.

* Generally take ten precepts, with a process distinct from laity and sāmaṇera*s.
* Occupy an ambivalent position between lay and monastic spheres.

## Sīladharās In The West

* The *sīladharā* order was established by Ajahn Sumedho in 1983 with permission from his Thai teacher's community.
* They take ten precepts, abstain from money, and wear dark brown robes.


## 4 Gender Equality And Bhikkhunī Ordination The Revival Of Bhikkhunī Ordination

* Eight and ten precept nuns in various Theravāda countries face discrimination compared to *bhikkhu*s.
* The unavailability of *bhikkhunī* ordination disadvantages women seeking a religious life within the Theravāda tradition.

* Attempts to revive *bhikkhunī* ordination have been ongoing, with a breakthrough in 1998 at Bodhgaya.
* This led to subsequent ordinations in Sri Lanka, but these *bhikkhunīs* lack official government recognition and associated privileges.

* *Bhikkhunī* ordinations have spread to Thailand, relying on foreign *bhikkhu*s due to a 1928 Saṅgha Act prohibiting Thai *bhikkhu*s from participating.
* In Myanmar, controversy surrounding a returning *bhikkhunī* led to a ban on further discussions of *bhikkhunī* ordination in 2004.

## Gender Equality And The Attitude Of Bhikkhus

* The revival of *bhikkhunī* ordination is fueled by global awareness of gender discrimination.
* Supporters argue for the acceptability of introducing the Dharmaguptaka lineage into Theravāda tradition, citing its Sri Lankan origin.
* Some suggest that senior *bhikkhu*s oppose it due to fear of economic competition and prejudice against Chinese monastics.
* However, the primary legal problem is the difference in *Vinaya* traditions between Dharmaguptaka and Theravāda, making cross-tradition ordination validity a complex issue.
* Traditional Theravādins object to accepting the validity of an ordination not based on Theravāda law and procedures.

## Gender Equality And The Attitude Of Nuns

* Asian women, including eight or ten precept nuns, may not perceive their situation through the lens of gender equality discourses.
* Some oppose *bhikkhunī* ordination revival, viewing it as a foreign agenda threatening their tradition and independence.
* Ethnographic research in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand reveals nuns' resistance to feminist interpretations and emphasis on equal rights.
* They value humility and moral purity, seeing the pursuit of status as self-serving and contrary to their values.
* While *bhikkhunī* ordination aligns with ancient Indian Buddhist heritage, its legality and lack of public recognition in some countries deter many nuns from pursuing it.
* Nuns rely on lay support, which is contingent upon adhering to established values and traditions. 


## Gender Equality And The Situation Of Bhikkhunīs

* Promoting *bhikkhunī* ordination for gender equality may not reflect the desires of all potential female monastics.
* Full gender equality within the Theravāda tradition is unlikely as *bhikkhunīs* have a lower status than *bhikkhus*.
* The *garudhamma* requires *bhikkhunīs* to show respect to *bhikkhus*, regardless of seniority.

## 5 Theravāda Vinaya And The Revival Of Bhikkhunī Ordination The Legal Viewpoint

* Later rulings in the Theravāda Vinaya supersede earlier ones on the same topic.
* This principle is crucial for understanding the rules regarding *bhikkhunī* ordination.

## The Rules On Bhikkhunī Ordination

* The Buddha established two rules concerning *bhikkhunī* ordination: "single ordination" and "dual ordination".
* Some argue that these rules contradict each other, rendering *bhikkhunī* ordination impossible in the Theravāda tradition.

## The Narrative Context Provided By The Sixth Garudhamma

* Examining the narrative context of the Vinaya rules is essential for proper interpretation.
* The sixth *garudhamma* states that both *bhikkhu* and *bhikkhunī* communities should participate in ordaining *bhikkhunīs*.

## The Narrative Context For The Ruling On Single Ordination

* The rule on "single ordination" was established when only one *bhikkhunī* existed, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.
* This rule allows *bhikkhus* to ordain *bhikkhunīs* in the absence of a *bhikkhunī* community.

* The rule on "dual ordination" applies when a *bhikkhunī* community exists, requiring both communities to participate in the ordination process.
* These two rules address different situations and are not contradictory.

## Conclusion

* A study of the Theravāda *Vinaya*'s bearing on the issue of *bhikkhun*ī ordination reveals its complexity, influenced by historical, social and political factors.
* The controversy surrounding *bhikkhun*ī ordination can be seen as a clash between two ideological constructs: one representing gender equality and globalized Buddhist sisterhood, the other embodying religious tradition safeguarded against Western interference.

# Atonement Of Pārājika Transgressions In Fifth-Century Chinese Buddhism1

* The paper examines rituals developed in China during the fifth century to overcome the most serious prātimokṣa transgressions, the pārājika offenses.

* While Western scholarship often portrays pārājika transgressions as leading to permanent expulsion from the monastic order, this is an oversimplification.
* Most surviving Indian vinaya traditions provide methods for atonement allowing those who violate some pārājikas to remain within the clerical fold in a reduced status called śikṣādattaka.

* The paper builds on Shayne Clarke's work and draws from additional Chinese sources to examine rituals for becoming a śikṣādattaka that became known in China beginning from the late fourth century CE.
* It then examines new rituals created by Chinese Buddhists to overcome perceived shortcomings of the methods found in the vinaya, integrating elements of vinaya atonement into Mahāyāna repentance rites.

* These new rituals demonstrate that vinaya-based rites of atonement exerted some influence on medieval Chinese Buddhist practice.

# Introduction

* All forms of Buddhism are deeply concerned with transgressions and their purification.
* The *vinaya*s, Buddhist monastic law-codes, define transgression and stipulate its legal and ritual consequences.
* The question of atonement is fundamental to the structure and purpose of the vinaya. 




## The Śikṣādattaka Penance

* Five extant *vinaya*s allow for one who transgresses the first pārā*jika* to become a ś*ikṣādattaka*.
* This provision is introduced through the story of Nandika, a monk who breaks his celibacy.
* A śikṣā*dattaka occupies a special rank within the monastic hierarchy, below fully ordained monks but above novices.

## Soteriological Consequences Of Pārājika Transgression

*  Transgression of the pārā*jika* precepts did not always mean expulsion from the monastic order.
* A śikṣā*dattaka is "not in communion" with other monks, but this does not necessarily mean physical expulsion.
* Shayne Clarke argues that śikṣā*dattaka*s were not deemed complete religious failures and could still achieve liberation.
* However, some Indian *vinaya* traditions held that violation of the pārā*jika* precepts had a permanently detrimental effect on one's spiritual potential. 
* Meditation manuals from the fifth century state that those who violate pārā*jika* precepts cannot practice meditation successfully in this lifetime.
* The *Vimuttimagga* and other texts suggest that śikṣādattaka penance was used within some Indian Buddhist communities.



# Vinaya-Style Rituals Of Atonement: The Secret Methods For Curing Meditation Sickness

* Buddhist texts translated into Chinese in the early fifth century discuss the spiritual potential of the śikṣā*dattaka* (in negative terms).
* Questions about atonement for violations of the pārā*jika*s did not share this fate.
* New methods for atonement appeared soon after these texts were translated into Chinese.

# The Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness

* Presents a number of different methods for dealing with impediments to meditation practice, including violation of precepts.
* Claims to be capable of destroying the soteriological impediments that accompany pārā*jika* violations.
* Promises to restore those who violate such precepts to their original status as fully-ordained monks or nuns.

# A Method For Healing Violations Of The Precepts

* Offers a powerful way of dealing with pārā*jika* transgressions.
* Elements are clearly modelled on *vinaya* atonements.
* Invokes the rules of the monastic prātimokṣa.
* Explains that this ritual can and should be used by anyone, including laypersons.

# Restoring Meditative Potential

* The main consequence of violating precepts is said to be the inability to attain advanced states of meditation.
* The ensuing method for removing these transgressions is introduced as a means of restoring meditative potential.

# The Ritual Process

* Practitioner confesses to his preceptor and brings to mind deities and objects of worship.
* Contemplates emptiness and imagines buddhas and bodhisattvas pouring water over his head.
* Imagines falling into the Avīci hell and prays to be rescued.
* Has an auspicious dream where buddhas appear emitting light that relieves his suffering.

# Atonement And Reinstatement

* Removes his outer robe and goes before other monks, expressing shame and repenting sins.
* Performs menial duties for eight hundred days.
* Bathes, puts on his saṅ*ghāti*, enters the sanctuary, concentrates his mind, and contemplates the light of the Buddha's white tuft of hair.
* Seeks to repent again before his preceptor, who assigns meditation practices.

# Formal Reinstatement

* Practitioner recites a script modelled on *karmavācanā* scripts used in monastic legal rituals.
* Recites the *prātimokṣa* eight hundred times.
* Regains the state of being no different than a pure monk and can recite precepts with the community.





# Expanding Audiences: The Oceanic Scripture On The Samādhi Of The Contemplation Of The Buddha

* The *Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness* promises benefits to transgressors of the *pārājika*s that Indian *vinaya* texts did not allow.
* This text seems to be an attempt to make *vinaya* rituals relevant to a broader audience, including lay Buddhists.
* However, the ritual itself still presumes a monastic context.

# The Ritual in the Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness

* The ritual involves "contemplations" and culminates in a vision of light from the Buddha's ūṛṇa.
* It includes eight hundred days of humbling service, primarily cleaning tasks like toilets and stupas.
* This penance is seen as a middle ground between traditional *śikṣādattaka* punishments and shorter probationary periods.

* The ritual promises restoration of meditative ability and full monastic status, unlike traditional *śikṣādattaka*s.


#  The Oceanic Scripture on the Samādhi of the Contemplation of the Buddha

* This text mentions a similar ritual for eliminating grave transgressions through contemplation of the Buddha's ūṛṇa.
* It suggests that this ritual is described in another scripture, possibly the *Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness*.
* The *Ocean Scripture* provides a more explicit description of the ritual, including cleaning, confession, and service to monks or parents.

* This version seems tailored for both monastic and lay practitioners, with alternative procedures for laypersons.

## Mahāyāna Repentance And Vinaya Atonement: The Scripture On The Contemplation Of The Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha

* This text explores rituals for repentance found in texts like the *Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness* and the *Ocean Scripture*.
* These rituals seem influenced by both *vinaya* (monastic code) procedures for atonement and Mahāyāna traditions. 
* The *vinaya* influence is seen in specific procedures, while the Mahāyāna influence is evident in concepts like contemplating emptiness to destroy transgressions.

## Scripture on the Contemplation of the Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha

* This text directly addresses the potential conflict between how grave transgressions (*pārājika*) are handled in *vinaya* rites and Mahāyāna repentance rituals.
* Upāli, a disciple of the Buddha, questions the Buddha about this contradiction, noting that while the *Ākāśagarbha-bodhisattva-sūtra* promises remission from even the worst sins, the *vinaya* demands expulsion for those who violate grave precepts.

* The text aims to reconcile these seemingly conflicting approaches by proposing a ritual that combines elements of both traditions.
* This ritual includes: 
    * Worship of the 35 buddhas (from the *Triskandha* ritual)
    * Worship of Ākāśagarbha bodhisattva
    * An eight-hundred-day penance of menial chores (similar to *vinaya* atonements).

* The text suggests that this combined approach offers both karmic purification and institutional restitution, addressing the concerns of both Mahāyāna and *vinaya* traditions. 




# The Ritual for Curing Sins

* Involves worshiping thirty-five buddhas, chanting their names for seven days, and chanting the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha.
* Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha appears in a dream or meditation and stamps the practitioner's arm with "sin removed" using a *maṇi-*jewel seal.

# The Alternative Procedure

* If the vision doesn't occur, repentance rituals continue for forty-nine days, weakening sins.
* The practitioner cleans toilets for eight hundred days, confesses past sins, and repents for twenty-one days.
* A ceremony with friends and intimates, chanting names of buddhas and bodhisattvas, takes place.

# Adaptation for Lay Practitioners

* Rituals seem adapted from monastic practices for lay use.
* The *Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha Contemplation* offers options depending on whether the practitioner is monastic or lay.

# Differences from Vinaya Rituals

* Unlike *Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness*, the *Scripture on the Contemplation of the Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha* doesn't require confession before monks.
* Deities act as witnesses instead of twenty ordained monks, making it more accessible to lay practitioners.

## Conclusions

* In the early fifth century, Chinese Buddhists had access to a large number of newly translated Indian monastic rules (*vinaya* texts).
* While it is unclear how directly these texts influenced daily monastic life, they did raise concerns about the need to conform to Indian practices.

* This was particularly true in Jiankang, where many new *vinaya* texts were translated and there was a large population of foreign monks.

* The attempt by the Zhihuan monastery to follow all regulations in the newly translated Mahāsāṅghika-*vinaya* proved difficult and controversial, highlighting tensions between established Chinese practices and perceived Indian authority.
* Ordination procedures became a point of contention, as seen in the case of concerns about the validity of early Chinese nuns' ordinations.

* The story of Huiguo and Guṇavarman demonstrates anxieties about proper ordination practices in light of *vinaya* requirements.
* Concerns over monastic status arose because failing to follow *vinaya* regulations could mean individuals were not actually considered monks or nuns.

* This anxiety likely explains the emergence of new rituals inspired by *vinaya* penance literature, which aimed to purify violations and restore monastic status.

* While Indian *vinaya* texts offered some solutions for transgressions, they did not fully address the most serious violations (*pārājika*s).
* Fifth-century Chinese rituals provided a greater potential for purification in these cases, possibly influenced by "Mahāyāna" ideas of karmic destruction.

* The relationship between *vinaya* atonement and Mahāyāna repentance was rarely discussed in India but became an issue in China.
* Rituals from the Scripture on the Contemplation of the Bodhisattva Ākāś*agarbha and Secret Methods for Curing Meditation Sickness attempted to reconcile these two traditions, integrating elements of both *vinaya* penance and Mahāyāna repentance.

* Chinese translation practices may have blurred the lines between *vinaya* and Mahāyāna concepts, as the same term (*chan hui*) was used to translate both "confession" and "atonement."
* This linguistic overlap may have encouraged Chinese Buddhists to explore the connections and differences between these ideas more deeply.

# Exploring Communities of Vinaya-Related Practice

* This section examines how communities practiced *vinaya* rules.
* It focuses on the transformation of formless precepts in the Platform Sutra (Liuzu tanjing 六祖壇經).

# The Transformation of the Formless Precepts in the Platform Sūtra (*Liuzu tanjing* 六祖壇經) 

* This section analyzes how the *Platform Sutra*, a key text in Chan Buddhism, reinterprets traditional formless precepts.
* It explores how these precepts are adapted to fit the unique practices and beliefs of Chan Buddhism.

## Introduction

* The Platform Sūtra is a well-known text in Chinese Chan Buddhism attributed to Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch.
* It recounts Huineng's inheritance of the mantle from Hongren, his teachings, and bestowal of "formless precepts."
* Multiple versions of the text exist, spanning from the eighth to thirteenth centuries, offering insights into the evolution of Chan Buddhism.

## The Platform Sūtra(S)

* The existence of multiple versions makes the *Platform Sūtra* unique among Chinese Buddhist texts.
* Scholarship has established that the *Platform Sūtra* is not a historical record but a text likely produced after Huineng's death.
* Huineng's prominence as the Sixth Patriarch is largely due to Shenhui, who claimed to be his disciple and sought recognition as the Seventh Patriarch.
* The narrative of the *Platform Sūtra*, including Huineng's rise from an illiterate firewood seller to a recognized patriarch, has resonated with both monastics and laypeople.

## Textual Criticism and the Evolution of the Platform Sūtra

* Textual criticism is crucial for understanding the relationship between different versions of the *Platform Sūtra*.
* A monk named Huixin revised an "old version" of the text in 967, dividing it into eleven chapters and two fascicles.
* Huixin's version became the basis for a longer edition with ten chapters and one fascicle, which eventually became the orthodox version.
* The orthodox version incorporated material from the *Jingde chuandeng lu* and other sources.





## Formless Precepts In The Dunhuang Platform Sūtra

* The formless precepts are central to the Dunhuang version of the *Platform Sūtra*.
* The title explicitly mentions them and Huineng's sermon focuses on their transmission.

* The text is divided into two parts: Huineng's sermon and his life story after the sermon.
* The sermon itself can be further divided into an autobiography and doctrinal instructions, with the latter leading up to the formless precepts ceremony.

* Huineng emphasizes that all beings possess Buddha nature and need to overcome dualistic thinking to realize it.
* His teaching is "sudden" as he points directly to our true nature without expedient means.

## Bodhisattva Ordinations In China

* The formless precepts in the *Platform Sūtra* emerged from a tradition of Mahāyāna Bodhisattva precepts for both monastics and lay people that began in the fifth century.
* Dharmakṣema was likely the first to confer these precepts in China, based on the *Pusa dichi jing*.

* The *Fanwang jing* became popular due to its inclusivity and accommodation of Chinese values like filial piety.
* It presented Bodhisattva precepts as accessible to all members of society.

* Numerous commentaries, manuals, and ritual texts for Bodhisattva precept ceremonies emerged, drawing on the *Fanwang jing* and other sources.
* These rituals followed a general liturgical framework that became stable by the 7th and 8th centuries.




## Bodhisattva-Precept Ceremonies In Chan Before The Platform Sūtra

* Early Chan movement embraced bodhisattva-precepts rituals while simplifying them and emphasizing doctrines of emptiness and inherent Buddha nature.
* Close connection between Chan and the Bodhisattva precept movement, with many early Chan masters also upholding the Vinaya (Buddhist monastic code).
* Daoxin and his disciple Hongren are considered key figures in the early development of Chan.

## The *Wu Fangbian*

* A text associated with Shenxiu, a rival of Huineng in the *Platform Sūtra*.
* Outlines a precept-conferral ceremony that can be divided into seven parts: 
    * Four Bodhisattva vows
    * Requests for Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be preceptors and witnesses
    * The three refuges (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha)
    * Questions about the five capabilities
    * Statement of names and repentance of transgressions
    * Declaration of ability to receive the Bodhisattva precepts
    * Meditation

* Does not list the Bodhisattva precepts themselves, implying they were well known.

## The *Tanyu*

* A text by Shenhui, another important Chan figure.
* Presents a less structured precept ceremony compared to the *Wu fangbian*.
* Can be divided into seven parts:
    * Introduction emphasizing the rarity of the opportunity
    * Homage to the Buddhas, Dharma, and Sangha (Three Treasures)
    * Repentance of sins using a formula similar to that in the *Wu fangbian*

* Includes repentance for various categories of sins.

# Exhortation to give rise to the Bodhi mind, and definition of Śīla, Prajñā, and Samādhi (known as "the three disciplines," *sanxue* 三學).

* Shenhui emphasizes giving rise to the unsurpassed Bodhi mind and seeking the unsurpassed Bodhi Dharma.
* He connects this to faith in Buddha's words and reliance on Buddha's teachings.
*  He defines Śīla (precepts) as not committing sins, Prajñā (wisdom) as practicing good things, and Samādhi (meditation) as purifying the mind.

# Exhortation to observe the precepts.

* Shenhui stresses maintaining pure precepts for all good Dharmas to arise.
* He highlights the necessity of upholding precepts for achieving unsurpassed Bodhi.
* He warns that even rebirth as a mangy jackal requires upholding precepts, let alone attaining Buddhahood.

# The effects of karma and lack of correct understanding of the Dharma.

* This section emphasizes the importance of meeting the right teachers.
* It criticizes the teachings of the two vehicles (Hīnayāna).
* Shenhui urges his audience to give rise to the unsurpassed bodhi mind and understand the Middle Path, which is the highest truth.

# Getting rid of all is meditation.

*  Shenhui advocates for those seeking liberation to rid themselves of Buddhist concepts.
* He states that true meditation involves letting go of realization of inner and outer worlds.
* This meditation, authorized by Buddha, cannot be expressed in words but is transmitted mind-to-mind. 




## The Formless Precepts In The Dunhuang Version Of The Platform Sūtra

* Huineng declares that all must receive formless precepts with their own bodies.

* **Refuge in the three-fold body of the Buddha:**

    * Recite refuge in Dharmakāya, Nirmāṇakāya, and Sambhogakāya Buddhas within oneself.
    * Corporal body is just an abode; the threefold body of the Buddha is within everyone's Dharma nature.
    * Taking refuge in the Dharmakāya Buddha means casting aside all that is not good.
    * Thinking good thoughts leads to Prajñā wisdom, which is the Nirmāṇakāya Buddha.

* **Four Bodhisattva vows:**

    * Recite vows to save sentient beings, cut off passions, study Buddhist teachings, and achieve the unsurpassed Buddha Way.
    * Everyone must save themselves in their own bodies with their own natures.

* **Formless repentances:**

    * Repentance is eliminating past bad actions with one's own nature.
    * Eliminate past arrogant mind and jealousy with one's own nature.
    * Forever cut off evil deeds.

* **Formless precepts of the three refuges:**

    * Take refuge in enlightenment, truth, and purity.
    * Buddha is enlightenment, Dharma is truth, Saṇgha is purity.
    * Investigate for yourselves; take refuge in your own natures.


## Comparisons with Other Texts

* The *Platform Sūtra*'s precepts are "formless" and implicitly reject the precept rituals in the *Wu fangbian* and the *Tanyu*.
* The *Platform Sūtra*'s precepts emphasize self-nature, while other texts focus on outer dualistic reality.
* The refuge in the three bodies of the Buddha within oneself is unique to the *Platform Sūtra*.

## Purpose and Function

* The Dunhuang *Platform Sūtra* is a literary work meant to be attractive to a broad readership.
* It may have functioned as a manual for Chan masters claiming descent from Huineng.
* Copies served as transmission documents, proving membership in Huineng's school.

## The Formless Precepts In The Huixin Version Of The Platform Sūtra

* The Huixin version is not extant but can be reconstructed from surviving versions based on it.
* The Huixin edition follows the Dunhuang version in content and order, with greater clarity and wordiness. 
* It also contains passages not found in the Dunhuang version, both radicalizing and sanitizing the *Platform Sūtra*.

## The Formless Precepts in the Huixin Version

* In the Huixin version, the precepts follow a discussion of meditation, but their order is different from the Dunhuang version.
* A new section on "five Dharmakāya incenses of the self nature" is added.
* The first set of precepts (three bodies of the Buddha) is moved to last position and given its own chapter.

## Five Dharmakāya Incenses

* These are traditional qualities of a fully enlightened Buddha, emphasized as being within each person.
* They are briefly discussed in texts attributed to Shenxiu and Bodhidharma.
* Their inclusion in Huixin's version seems likely due to their presence in the earlier text he used.

## Formless Repentances

* Closely resemble those in the Dunhuang version, with further emphasis on self-nature.
* The last part of the Dunhuang version stating that repentance is cutting off evil deeds is omitted.

## Four Bodhisattva Vows

* Huixin adds "own mind" or "self nature" to each vow, emphasizing their internal focus.
* This change seems intended to integrate the vows better with other formless precepts.

## Three Refuges

* No substantial difference from the Dunhuang version.

## Refuge in the threefold body of the Buddha

* Given extra prominence in Huixin's version, having its own chapter.
* A statement by Huineng underlines the importance of these precepts.

## Significance of Formless Precepts

* Although given prominence, they are not specifically identified as "formless precepts" in Huixin's version.
* The term is only used once at the beginning of the text.
* Huixin's preface does not mention them, focusing instead on seeing one's Buddha nature.
* Instructions to recite three times after the three refuges are omitted.

## Conclusion

* Huixin's version weakens the significance of the formless precepts as an actual ceremony.
* This trend continued in subsequent versions, culminating with the orthodox version.

## The Formless Precepts In The Orthodox Version Of The Platform Sūtra

* The orthodox version of the *Platform Sūtra*, represented by the Zongbao edition, significantly changes the context and meaning of the formless precepts compared to earlier versions.
* Unlike the Dunhuang and Huixin versions, the orthodox version presents the formless precepts as a standalone event occurring after Huineng's preaching at the Dafan temple.

## Changes in the Context of the Formless Precepts

* The precept ceremony is no longer part of Huineng's core sermon or connected to his teachings on prajñāpāramitā.
* It is presented as a spontaneous event inspired by the needs of lay people who gathered at Huineng's mountain.
* Monastics are excluded from this ceremony, implying it is irrelevant for them.

## Reformulation of the Formless Repentances

* The Zongbao edition follows the reformulated repentances found in the Kōshōji version.
* This version resembles a "real" repentance ritual with a formula for seeking forgiveness.
* The focus shifts from abstract descriptions to a concrete act of repentance.

## Significance of the Changes

* The changes reflect a shift in Buddhist practices during the Song dynasty, where repentance rituals became more popular.
* The editors likely felt the earlier version's abstract repentances were inadequate and amended them accordingly.
* The inclusion of Bodhisattva precepts based on the *Fanwang jing* in monastic ordination may have also influenced the exclusion of monastics from the formless precepts in the orthodox version.



## Conclusion

* The early Chan tradition experimented with different ceremonies and settings for dispensing Bodhisattva precepts.
* Editors of texts like the Dunhuang Platform Sutra drew on liturgical models while promoting Chan's message of inherent Buddha nature.
* There appears to be a trajectory from the Wu fangbian through the Tanyu to the Dunhuang version of the Platform Sutra, with each text presenting a different approach to precepts.

## Bibliography

* This section lists numerous academic sources related to Chan Buddhism and the Platform Sutra. 


## A Missing Page in Sui-Tang Vinaya History: Zhishou and the Vinaya Tradition Based on the Great Chanding Monastery in Chang'an

* Daoxuan, a key figure in the Lüzong school of Chinese Buddhism, was mentored by Zhishou.
* Despite Zhishou's importance, there has been little scholarly focus on his life and contributions to the vinaya tradition.
* Understanding Zhishou requires considering his predecessors, the "Vinaya Patriarchs," and their connection to the Sifen lü (Dharmaguptaka-vinaya). 




# The Sifen Lü Tradition In Medieval China Before Zhishou

* Vinaya, a core Buddhist concept referring to precepts and disciplines, had five initial traditions.
* Four of these traditions were transmitted to East Asia and translated into Chinese.
* These four traditions are known as *Shisong lü*, Sengqi lü, *Sifen lü*, and *Wufen lü*.
* The *Sifen lü* tradition eventually became the dominant vinaya tradition in China.

# Zhishou and His Contemporaries

* This section aims to clarify confusion surrounding early "Vinaya Patriarchs" and their relationships.
* It will discuss Zhishou and his contemporaries in relation to these predecessors.
* The section will reappraise Zhishou's historical position within the context of early Chinese vinaya tradition history.

# Reconstructing Zhishou's Life and Legacy

* Understanding a religious figure requires knowledge of their personal and intellectual life.
* Daoxuan, Zhishou's biographer, left gaps in his account of Zhishou's life.
* Other sources must be consulted to gain a complete understanding of Zhishou.

# The Chandingsi Vinaya Tradition


* This section examines the vinaya tradition at the Chandingsi monasteries.
* It will focus on the activities of various vinaya monks at these monasteries.
* The research reveals that the Great Chanding Monastery had a strong vinaya tradition, while the Chanding Monastery had little influence.



## 1.1 From Fachong To Huiguang'S Disciples: The Early Sifen Lü Tradition

* Facong was the first Chinese monk to preach on the *Sifen lü*.
* He switched his focus from the *Sengqi lü* to the *Sifen lü* after realizing the importance of the latter.
* Facong primarily focused on oral explanations of the *Sifen lü* and did not compose a written commentary.

* Daofu was a disciple of Facong who wrote a six-volume commentary on the *Sifen lü*.
* His commentary was textual in nature and did not address the broader principles of the tradition.
* Daofu's commentary is no longer extant.

* Huiguang, a prominent monk during the Northern Qi dynasty, learned the *Sifen lü* through oral transmission from Facong and Daofu's group.
* He became a prolific commentator and lecturer on various Buddhist scriptures, including the *Sifen lü*.
* His commentary on the *Sifen lü* became an important guide for later generations of vinaya students.





## 1.2 Huiguang'S Disciples

* Huiguang had many talented disciples, with Daoyun, Daohui, and Fayuan being the most outstanding.
* Fayuan was the only one of these three to have a separate entry in the *Xu Gaoseng zhuan*.
* He was known as "the Tiger of Vinaya" due to his debating skills.
* Fayuan left behind a commentary on the Sifen lü and a work entitled "Shifei chao".

## Daoyun

* Daoyun became a disciple of Huiguang at a young age.
* He dedicated himself to promoting vinaya after Huiguang's death.
* Daoyun composed a nine-*juan* commentary on the *Sifen lü*, which Daohui condensed into seven *juan*.
* Daoxuan compared Daoyun and Daohui to the head and tail of a vinaya tradition.

## Daohui

* Daohui was known for his lofty spirit and sometimes disregarded formalities.
* He collaborated with Daoyun in lecturing activities.
* Daohui aimed to modify and refine Huiguang's teachings as developed by Daoyun.
* He was particularly skilled in explaining monastic rules (*qiandu*).


## Fayuan

* Fayuan built on the work of Daoyun and Daohui, surpassing them according to Daoxuan.
* He served as rector of several monasteries before being appointed abbot of the Da Xingguosi.
* Fayuan's commentary on the *Sifen lü* was highly influential. 




## 1.3 Daohong And Hongzun: The Two Most Important Mentors To Zhishou

* Daohong was a disciple of Daoyun active in Xiangzhou during the early Sui dynasty.
* He was known for his charismatic vinaya lectures, which attracted hundreds of attendees.
* Several prominent Buddhist monks, including Huijin, Daojie, Huixiu, and Zhishou, studied under Daohong.

## Hongzun's Role in Spreading the Sifen Lü Tradition

* Hongzun initially studied with Daoyun but later became a disciple of Daohui, who was known for promoting the *Sifen lü*.
* He faced resistance from the local Buddhist community in Chang'an, which favored the *Sengqi lü* tradition.
* To overcome this resistance, Hongzun used the *Lotus sutra* as an expedient to attract people to his *Sifen lü* lectures.
* Over time, Hongzun's efforts led to the acceptance of the *Sifen lü* in Guanzhong and eventually contributed to the decline of the *Sengqi lü*. 




## 2 Zhishou And Contemporary Vinaya Masters

* Zhishou was a prominent figure in promoting the *Sifen lü* tradition in Chang'an during the Tang dynasty.
* He studied vinaya under Daohong and Zhimin, both influential masters of their time.
* Zhishou played a crucial role in systematizing the *Sifen lü* tradition through his extensive commentaries and lectures.

* His commentary "Wubu qufen chao" (A Commentary on Discriminating the Five Divisions [of the Vinaya Teachings]) is considered a significant contribution to vinaya scholarship.
* Hongzun, another prominent *Sifen lü* advocate, recognized Zhishou's expertise and encouraged his students to learn from him.

* Daoxuan mentions several other notable *Sifen lü* experts who were contemporaries of Zhishou: Fali, Daoliang, Daoxing, Daoshuo, Fasheng, Haizang, and Zhixing.
* These monks contributed to the spread and understanding of the *Sifen lü* through their teachings, commentaries, and monastic leadership.

* Fali, a native of Zhao, established the Xiangbu sect of the vinaya tradition with his ten-juan commentary on the *Sifen lü*.
* Daoliang, also from Zhaozhou, was known for his austere practice and deep understanding of both meditation and vinaya.
* Daoxing was praised for his eloquence and dedication to his teacher Fayuan.

* Fasheng, despite his erudition, is described as having a reputation that did not match his abilities.
* Haizang served on the ten-member committee responsible for national monastic affairs during the early Tang dynasty.

## 3 Problematizing The Traditional Vinaya Lineages

* Yan Zhenqing's version of the Lüzong lineage has three problems:
    * It presents Fayuan as the teacher of five masters, contradicting Daoxuan's assertion that these masters studied under Daoyun.
    * It identifies Hongzun as Zhishou's teacher, contrary to Daoxuan's account.
    * It lists Hongyuan as a disciple of Daoxuan, which is unlikely given their age difference.

* Yuanzhao's *Lüzong jiuzu shuo* presents a lineage with nine patriarchs, including two Indian masters and seven Chinese ones.
    * This version suggests an unbroken transmission from Facong to Daoxuan.

* An investigation of early "Vinaya Patriarchs" reveals a different picture:
    * Little is known about Facong and Daofu, their relationship to the *Sifen lü*, or their lives in general.
    * Huiguang was likely preoccupied with sutras rather than vinaya texts.
    * There's no evidence of a lineal transmission between these three "Vinaya Patriarchs."

* Daoyun played a more active role in the formation of the *Sifen lü* tradition:
    * He taught both his own disciples and Huiguang's disciples.
    * He emphasized the *Sifen lü* after Huiguang's death, becoming its leading proponent.

* Zhishou emerged as an important figure due to his connections with Daoyun's disciples:
    * Daohong cultivated Zhishou as his most outstanding disciple.
    * Hongzun ceded leadership to Zhishou.

* Zhishou's success lay not only in spreading the *Sifen lü* but also in training numerous vinaya masters, laying the foundation for vinaya study in the early Tang dynasty.



## 4 More Vinaya Masters Associated With The Twin Chanding Monasteries

* This section will examine additional vinaya masters connected to the twin Chanding monasteries:
    * Three more disciples of Zhishou will be discussed.
    * Two vinaya masters active during the Sui-Tang transition will be introduced.
    * Two more vinaya masters, one active after the Huichang persecution, will be explored. 



## 4.1 Huijin, Huiman, And Zhixing: Zhishou'S Three Disciples At The Great Chanding Monastery

* Huijin was a disciple of Zhishou who focused on vinaya and the *She dacheng lun*.
* He preceded his vinaya lectures with expositions on the *She dacheng lun*.
* Another disciple, Huiman, was known for his strict adherence to precepts and gave numerous lectures on the *Sifen lü*.
* He also composed a commentary on the *Sifen lü*.
* Zhixing, another disciple, was an expert on vinaya, especially the *Sifen lü* tradition.

## 4.2 Zhibao, Juelang And Xuanwan: Three Early Tang Vinaya Masters Connected To The Chandingsi

* Two more significant vinaya monks, Zhibao and Juelang, resided at the Chanding monastery.
* Zhibao was known for his austerity and befriended Huiman, a disciple of Zhishou.
* Juelang was an expert on the *Sifen lü* and Nirvāṇ*a Sūtra*.
* He served as the abbot of the Great Chanding monastery towards the end of the Daye era.
* Xuanwan, another vinaya master, had ties to the Chanding monastery through his association with meditation master Tanlun.




## 4.3 Xuanchang And Huiling: Two More Tang Vinaya Masters Affiliated With The Great Chanding Monastery

* Xuanchang was a prominent vinaya master affiliated with the Zongchi Monastery in the late Tang dynasty.

## Introduction

* This paper discusses the adoption of foreign astrology within Chinese Buddhism, focusing on the Tang dynasty (618–907).
* Despite prohibitions against astrology in early Buddhist texts, a rich tradition of Chinese Buddhist astrology developed during the eighth and ninth centuries.
* The paper explores how practices contradicting religious laws were embraced by the Buddhist community.

## Historical Background

* Astrology is based on the belief that celestial movements influence earthly events and determine fate.
* Early Buddhists generally frowned upon divination practices, including astrology, though they did not necessarily reject its validity.
* In contrast to India, Chinese civilization valued astrology, with court astrologers holding respected positions. 
* This cultural difference likely influenced how Chinese Buddhist monks viewed astrology.

## Prohibitions Against Astrology In Buddhist Literature

* **Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna-sūtra:**
    * Argues against the validity of astrology in detail.
    * Encourages monks to focus on *nirvāṇa* instead of star gazing.
    * Condemns astrology as unacceptable for a monk, alongside other activities like painting and singing.

* **Sūtra of the Buddha's Bequeathed Teachings:**
    * Summarizes the Buddha's teachings before his death.
    * Prohibits monks from engaging in divination, observing stars, astronomical calculations, and calendrical calculations.

* **Dharmagupta Vinaya:**
    * Specifically proscribes the practice of divination.
    * Forbids monks from forecasting astrologically auspicious dates for mundane activities.
    * Allows astrology to be used for instructing laypeople on Buddhist practices.

* **Daoxuan's writings:**
    * Identifies divination and astronomy as misconduct.
    * Outlines five types of "wickedness" related to seeking livelihood through inappropriate means, including divination.





## Buddhism And Astrology In The Tang

* Although Indian astrology had been translated into Chinese before, the introduction of Esoteric Buddhism in the eighth century sparked widespread interest in foreign astrology amongst monks and poets.
* Monk Yixing, known for translating the *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* and creating a new state calendar, exemplified this trend by reforming Chinese astrology to include newly acquired territories.

## Perceptions Of The Vinaya In The Tang

* Despite vinaya codes prohibiting astrology, divination, and astronomy, many Tang monks ignored these rules.
* This lax attitude stemmed from a focus on Mahāyāna bodhisattva precepts, which some believed superseded Śrāvakayāna vinaya.
* Fazang's commentary on the *Brahma Net Sūtra*, influenced by the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra, argued that bodhisattvas could engage in transgressive acts with benevolent intentions.
* The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra* sanctioned the study of worldly arts, including astrology, for bodhisattvas seeking to benefit beings.



## Conclusion

* Astrology was practiced in both China and India, so its presence in Buddhist traditions is unsurprising.
* Early Buddhists viewed astrology as a base art not to be practiced by monks, echoing Brahman sentiments.
* Despite this view, Buddhism did not necessarily deem astrology invalid.
* The *Saddharmasmṛ*tyupasthāna-sūtra* refuted the validity of astrology, but its impact was limited.

##  The Development of Buddhist Astrology in China

* Vinaya texts and eminent figures like Daoxuan opposed monks practicing astrology.
* Despite these prohibitions, a tradition of Buddhist astrology emerged in China from the eighth century.
* Key figures included Yixing and Amoghavajra.
* The development of this tradition highlights the limited effect of scriptural proscriptions.

##  The Tang Dynasty Context

* The belief that Mahāyāna precepts superseded Hīnayāna precepts contributed to the emergence of Buddhist astrology in the Tang dynasty.
* Amoghavajra's *Xiuyao jing*, an astrology manual, contained practices contradicting Buddhist ethics.
* The Chinese sangha in the Tang dynasty was not strict in enforcing vinaya regulations.

##  Implications

* The existence of Buddhist astrology despite canonical regulations reveals the sangha's ability to pursue its interests independently.
* This case suggests further investigation into other areas where monastic codes interacted with imperial ambitions and ecclesiastical sanctioning.
