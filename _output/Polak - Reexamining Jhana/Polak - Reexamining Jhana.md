# Introduction
* Buddhism's popularity has grown steadily, with new movements emerging and old ones revitalized.
* Despite this abundance, the historical Buddha seems overshadowed by later charismatic figures.
* This book aims to reconstruct aspects of early Buddhism, recognizing that modern forms have evolved.
* Discrepancies exist between Theravāda doctrine and the earliest teachings in the Suttapitaka.

# The Nature of Early Indian Spirituality
* Ancient Indian thinkers were not focused on theoretical speculation or creating ethical systems.
* The Western concept of religion doesn't apply to ancient Indian thought.
* Meditation was not an end in itself but a means to transcend suffering and achieve liberation.
* Early Buddhism was a soteriological system, linking philosophy, meditation, and the pursuit of salvation.

# Early Buddhist Meditation: A Polemic
* The traditional view that Theravāda Buddhism preserves early Buddhist meditation in its pure form is challenged.
* Discrepancies exist between early suttas and later Theravāda meditative scriptures.
* Major internal discrepancies are also present within the Suttapitaka itself.
* This book critiques the orthodox vision of early Buddhist meditation, particularly regarding the role of 'jhāna'.

# Chapter Outline
* The book is a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis.
* It includes a critical discussion of relevant scholarship on early Buddhism and proposes new solutions and arguments.

## Chapter Outline

* **The Jhāna Controversy**
    * The traditional view on Buddhist meditation sees the four jhānas as a yogic type of meditation not necessary for liberation. This contrasts with the Suttapitaka's image of jhāna meditation, creating the "jhāna controversy."
    * This fundamental conflict requires explanation through reconstructing the process that led to the reinterpretation of jhāna meditation.

* **Establishing the Relative Earliness or Lateness of Suttas**
    * Proposes and evaluates methods for determining the relative age of suttas within the Nikāyas.
    * Aims to develop a methodology for reconstructing the evolution of early Buddhist concepts, such as jhāna meditation.
    * Examines the possibility that the earliest stratum of the Suttapitaka was authored by the Buddha himself.

* **Investigating Criticized Meditation Methods**
    * Builds upon Bronkhorst's work on the two traditions of meditation in ancient India.
    * Analyzes suttas criticizing specific meditation methods and compares them to scriptures from non-Buddhist traditions.
    * Argues that *indriyabhāvanā*, described in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta, likely represents the final stages of jhāna meditation, contradicting the traditional view.

* **Analyzing the Sandha Sutta**
    * Analyzes the Sandha Sutta, which criticizes a particular meditation method.
    * Compares its structure to other suttas and concludes that its description of *ājānīya* jhāna is an alternative account of the same meditative state often described as the four jhānas.

* **Yogic Meditation in Non-Buddhist Scriptures**
    * Examines meditative scriptures from non-Buddhist traditions, building on Bronkhorst's work.
    * Discovers a new criticized method of meditation in the Sandha Sutta, leading to a re-examination of these scriptures.
    * Concludes that the method criticized in the Sandha Sutta is a key feature of yogic meditation, found in almost all non-Buddhist meditative scriptures.

* **The Original Soteriological Context of Yogic Meditation**
    * Disagrees with Bronkhorst's claim that Jainism provides the original context for yogic meditation.
    * Argues that there is no such original context and that yogic practices were originally non-theoretical, providing an altered state of mind and body.

* **The Authenticity of Suttas Describing the Bodhisatta's Path**
    * Focuses on the authenticity of suttas detailing the bodhisatta's path to liberation, as much evidence relies on these texts.
    * Supports Wynne's argument that Ālāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta were real historical figures.

* **The Authenticity of Accounts of Side Effects from Meditation**
    * Argues for the authenticity of the account of severe side effects resulting from the bodhisatta's breathless meditation, comparing it to descriptions in Swami Rama's *Path of Fire and Light*.

* **Comparing Buddhist and Jain Accounts**
    * Compares the account of extreme ascetic practices from the Māhasīhanāda Sutta with the Jain Āyāram. ga Sutta, finding significant similarities suggesting the Buddhist account may be based on the Jain one.

* **The Ariyapariyesana Sutta and Bodhirājakumāra Sutta**
    * Disagrees with Wynne's claim that the original account of the bodhisatta's awakening is in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.
    * Compares both suttas and concludes that the Ariyapariyesana Sutta is a modified version of the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, likely due to the compiler's view on *saññāvedayitanirodha*.

* **The Visuddhimagga and the Suttapitaka**
    * Investigates the orthodox theory of jhāna meditation presented in the Visuddhimagga.
    * Examines the role of the ten *kasin.* as, *arūpas*, *nimittas*, *vitakka*, and *vicāra* in both texts.

* **Conclusions**
    * Concludes that several crucial meditative concepts in the Visuddhimagga lack basis in the Suttapitaka and sometimes contradict its meaning.

# 1. Jhāna And Yoga
* The orthodox theory of meditation in the Visuddhimagga is seen as a final stage in reinterpreting early Buddhist jhāna meditation.
* The Visuddhimagga introduces new elements not found in earlier suttas, suggesting a wider trend to interpret jhāna as yogic meditation.
*  The original meaning of jhāna was likely lost, and the introduction of *arūpas* into the four jhānas contributed to this reinterpretation.

# 2.2.2. Ānāpānasati Meditation
* The Visuddhimagga's account of *ānāpānasati* meditation is compared to descriptions in suttas.
* An evolution of *ānāpānasati* can be reconstructed, with the original form being understood as yogic practice at some point.

# 2.2.3. Saññāvedayitanirodha
* *Saññāvedayitanirodha* is an important intermediary stage in the evolution of Buddhist meditative concepts.
* It emerged when the original meaning of jhāna was lost, and Buddhists sought a meditative state with similar qualities.

# 2.2.4. The Origin of the Four Jhānas
* This sub-chapter examines counter-evidence to the claim that the four jhānas were exclusively Buddhist.
* Texts like the Brahmajāla Sutta and Jhāna Sutta are analyzed and deemed inauthentic, suggesting a later development of Buddhist doctrine.

# 2.3. Theravāda Meditation
* This section focuses on whether the Theravāda tradition preserved the original form of early Buddhist meditation.

# 2.3.1. Origins of Vipassanā and Kammat.t.hāna
* Modern meditative traditions within Theravāda Buddhism originated relatively recently, around the beginning of the twentieth century.

# 2.3.2. Teachings of Vipassanā and Kammat.t.hāna Masters
* The teachings contain non-Buddhist elements, indicating strong outside influence on Buddhist meditation practices.

# 2.3.3. Analysis of the Yogāvacara Manual
* This obscure manual confirms the trend of Buddhist meditation being influenced by external sources, in this case tantric influences.

# 2.3.4. The "Meditative Slumber" of Theravāda Buddhism
* This sub-chapter explores why Theravāda Buddhists seemingly neglected meditation for a long period.
* Texts like the Gotamī Sutta suggest that ancient Buddhists believed they lived in an era of decline, making jhāna practice meaningless.

# Perspectives
* This section offers tentative solutions to understanding early Buddhist jhāna meditation.
* It explores connections between jhāna and other elements of early Buddhist soteriology.
* Topics include: jhāna and liberating insight, *lokuttara* jhāna, liberating knowledge, mindfulness, the concept of liberation, jhāna and the end of the world, and various meditative practices.

# Aftermath
* This chapter discusses the justification and significance of critical Buddhist studies.
* It examines the crisis in Western science and considers the future perspectives of Buddhism.




## The Problem Of The Jhānas

* The issue of suffering is central to Buddhist teachings.
* Early Buddhism emphasizes the path leading to the cessation of suffering through meditation.
* Meditation aims to dispel ignorance and cultivate understanding.

## 1.1.1 the general place of jhāna in the buddhist system of meditation

* Two main methods for cultivating the mind are distinguished: *samatha* (serenity) and *vipassanā* (insight).
* *Samatha* involves focusing on a single object to develop concentration, leading to states of deep meditative absorption known as jhānas.
* *Vipassanā* aims at gaining direct understanding of the nature of phenomena through broad awareness.

## 1.1.2 Jhāna In The Eyes Of The Modern Theravādin Meditation Masters

* Achieving jhānas may not be necessary for developing insight.
* Access concentration (*upacāra samādhi*), a state preceding full absorption, can provide sufficient concentration to overcome hindrances.
* Meditators can use the concentration gained through *samatha* practice to develop *vipassanā*.

## And Also In Other Place:

* *Upacāra Samādhi* involves calming the mind and then observing external activity with a calm mind to cultivate wisdom.
* Access concentration is not essential for developing understanding, as momentary concentration (*khanika samādhi*) developed during *vipassanā* meditation can also lead to insight. 
* *Khanika samādhi* involves mindfulness of changing bodily sensations, feelings, consciousness, and mental objects, leading to the clear seeing of the five aggregates.

## The Flaws of Jhāna:

* Jhāna, while providing deep absorption and pleasant feelings, does not lead to liberating insight and can lead to addiction to blissful states.
*  The fixed concentration of jhāna can result in clinging to bliss or misuse of yogic powers (*iddhi*), potentially increasing defilements.
* Achieving jhāna may lead to rebirth in celestial realms, delaying the opportunity for liberation through Nibbāna.

## Ajaan Chah's Perspective:

* Jhāna, while peaceful and happy, can create attachment and clinging to pleasant feelings, hindering further investigation and insight.
*  The meditator may become stuck in the happiness of jhāna, neglecting other aspects of practice. 




## 1.1.3 The General Overview Of The Place Of Jhāna In The Suttapit.Aka

* Jhāna occupies a central place in the Pāli Canon suttas, potentially appearing more frequently than *vipassanā*.
* Descriptions of jhāna are consistent throughout the Canon and appear in various schemes depicting the path to liberation.
* Jhāna played a crucial role in the Buddha's own journey to enlightenment according to the suttas.

## The Role of Jhāna in Buddhist Practice

* Jhāna is a key component in the Sāmaññaphala Scheme, a dominant theme in the Dīgha Nikāya and Majjhima Nikāya depicting the stages of practice leading to liberation.
* Jhāna is included in various numerical sets representing the Buddhist path, such as the noble eightfold path, five faculties, and five strengths.

## Praise for Jhāna

* Several suttas praise jhāna highly, associating it with realizations like Nibbāna, security, deathlessness, fearlessness, tranquility, cessation, and more.
* The Sam. yutta Nikāya contains two collections of suttas dedicated solely to jhāna, emphasizing its importance in attaining Nibbāna.

## Jhāna as a Necessary Condition for Liberation

* Some suttas explicitly state that jhāna is necessary for the development of discernment (*paññā*), which is considered crucial for eradicating spiritual ignorance.
* The Dhammapada suggests that both jhāna and *paññā* are inseparable and arise together, challenging traditional views on jhāna as a prerequisite for *paññā*.

## Emphasis on Jhāna Practice

* Many suttas conclude with an exhortation to practice jhāna, even those not directly related to meditative issues.
* This emphasis suggests that the Buddha considered jhāna to be essential for his practical path to liberation.

## 1.1.4 The Jhāna Controversy

* Many suttas emphasize the importance of jhāna for liberation.
* Vipassanā is rarely mentioned and not described in detail in the suttas.
* This contradicts the modern view that vipassanā is crucial for enlightenment.
* This discrepancy raises questions about the nature and role of jhāna in early Buddhism.

## 1.1.5 The Quest for the Earliest Stratum of the Suttapit.aka

* We lack access to the earliest stratum of Buddhist doctrine.
* The Visuddhimagga, written by Buddhaghosa in the 5th century AD, represents the fully developed Theravāda orthodox theory of meditation.
* It synthesizes doctrines from suttas, Abhidhamma scriptures, and lost commentaries.
* The Visuddhimagga defines the basic level of Buddhist soteriology accepted by all schools.
* While other schools may see it as a slower path, it remains the universally recognized path to liberation.

# Investigating Early Buddhism

* Modern interpretations of Theravāda Buddhism are influenced by Buddhaghosa's work but may not be identical to the original teachings.
* The Visuddhimagga, a key Theravāda text, has a theoretical focus compared to the practical emphasis of modern vipassanā and kammat.t.hāna movements.

# Challenges in Reconstructing Early Buddhism

* Simply comparing the Suttapitaka (Pāli Canon) with the Visuddhimagga is insufficient because the Suttapitaka itself contains discrepancies and may not represent the earliest stratum of Buddhism.
* The Suttapitaka was transmitted orally for centuries before being written down, making it susceptible to modifications.

# Limitations of Etymological Analysis

* Analyzing the etymology of Pāli words in the suttas is unlikely to provide a reliable stratification because:
    * It's unclear if Pāli was a spoken language undergoing significant evolution during the relevant period.
    * The crucial modifications within the suttas likely happened within a relatively short timeframe (two centuries).

# Comparing Canons of Different Schools

* Comparing the Theravāda Canon with canons of other extinct Buddhist schools could potentially reveal a core set of texts representing early Buddhism.
* Unfortunately, only fragments of other canons survive, limiting the usefulness of this approach.

# Analyzing Narrative Context

* Examining the narrative context surrounding suttas (e.g., setting, interlocutors) to assess authenticity is problematic because:
    * Much of the narrative context involves supernatural events and idealized portrayals of the Buddha, suggesting later additions for propaganda purposes.
    * Shorter suttas often lack narrative context altogether.




# The Structure of the Sāmaññaphala Sutta

* This sutta describes the Buddhist path to liberation. 
* It includes descriptions of the teachings of six ascetics and a section on "higher virtue."
* The section on higher virtue is likely from a later period when Buddhism became more established.
* The narrative context is probably the latest addition, explaining why the ascetics don't directly answer the king's question.

# Stock Passages in the Suttapitaka

* The Suttapitaka consists of thousands of suttas, many containing repeated fragments called "stock passages."
* These stock passages are numerical lists describing elements of Buddhist doctrine (e.g., four jhānas, four noble truths).
* They facilitated memorization but also made later modifications easier by allowing for insertions.

# Identifying Original Elements

* When investigating early Buddhist concepts, it's important to consider the presence of different forms of sets containing these concepts.
* To determine the original form, consider frequency, context fit, connection to other sets, naturalness, and proximity to the Visuddhimagga.

# Investigating the Buddha's Path

* Suttas depicting the Buddha's path to liberation are particularly important for understanding early Buddhism.
* They offer insights into his views, practices, and discoveries.
* Analyzing these suttas can shed light on the role of jhāna in his teachings.

# Reconstructing Missing Information

* Sutta definitions sometimes omit aspects that might have been obvious in the Buddha's time.
* We can reconstruct this missing information by considering critiques of other practices and inferring what jhānas are not.

# Relating Seemingly Unconnected Concepts

* Some concepts in the Suttapitaka appear related but are never explicitly connected.
* Analyzing associated elements can reveal shared elements, suggesting a similar meaning or place on the path to liberation.

# Dealing with Nearly Identical Sets

* When sets differ by only one element, it's tempting to assume forgery.
* However, the Buddha often used different terms to describe different aspects of the same phenomenon.
* Further analysis is needed to determine if both elements are authentic and represent different features.

# Interpretations in the Suttas

* Some suttas interpret statements from other parts of the Suttapitaka.
* This suggests these interpreted fragments are from earlier strata of the Pali Canon.
* Early concepts became unclear to later Buddhists, requiring interpretation.
* These interpretive suttas sometimes have a unique catechetical style.

# Dating Suttas

* Sets of suttas on the same subject in Samyutta Nikaya and Anguttara Nikaya suggest a development over time.
* Earlier suttas are shorter and contain fewer elements, while later ones are longer and add new elements.
* This suggests the earliness of the first suttas and lateness of the following ones.

# Unexpected Statements

* Some suttas contain statements that seem to contradict orthodox doctrine.
* These cause interpretative problems and uneasiness for later Buddhists.
* They may represent the earliest stratum or be influenced by outside sources.

# Reconstructing Early Buddhism

* Reconstructing early Buddhism solely from suttas is naive due to discrepancies within the Suttapitaka and with later scriptures.
* A comprehensive reconstruction must explain these discrepancies and the changes in jhana's role within Buddhist doctrine.

# The Role of Jhāna

* Jhāna's place in early Buddhist soteriology needs investigation, considering its connection to sati (mindfulness) and paññā (understanding).
* Understanding jhāna's role sheds light on the nature of liberation in early Buddhism.

# Theoretical Underpinnings

* Early Buddhist soteriology had a practical character but was underpinned by theory.
* Reconstructing jhāna's theoretical underpinnings could illuminate its nature and any changes connected to its reinterpretation.

# Alternative Perspectives

* Some scholars argue against reconstructing early Buddhism, citing the lack of access to other canons or claiming suttas are merely myth.
* Others suggest archeological evidence is more reliable than scriptures for understanding ancient Buddhism.

# The Buddha's Teachings

* The Buddha's life lacked spectacular events, suggesting his teachings were revolutionary.
* It's possible the earliest stratum of Buddhist soteriology reflects the Buddha's original teachings.

# Disciples and the Early Doctrine

* Unlike in Christianity, the Buddha's disciples seem to be overshadowed by their Teacher.
* This suggests the earliest stratum may closely reflect the Buddha's own path to awakening.

## 1.2 The Criticized Methods Of Meditation In The Suttapit.Aka

* This section analyzes suttas that describe the bodhisatta's path to awakening and the methods he rejected before achieving enlightenment.

* The most complete account is found in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta (MN 85), while other suttas like Mahāsaccaka Sutta (MN 36) and San. gārava Sutta (MN 100) focus on his strivings before awakening.
* The autobiographic narrative starts with Siddhattha Gotama renouncing household life and going forth into homelessness, a decision made openly, not in secrecy.

* Contrary to popular depictions, the sutta doesn't mention Gotama's wife or son, suggesting these details were added later.
* The bodhisatta sought guidance from renowned teachers Āl.āra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, mastering their teachings but finding them ultimately unsatisfactory.

* He then practiced intense austerities like breath control and fasting, which led to physical suffering without bringing liberation.

* A pivotal moment came when he remembered experiencing jhāna in his youth, leading him to abandon asceticism and embrace a more balanced approach.
* This contradicts the popular narrative of Mara's temptation or Mucalinda's protection during enlightenment.

* The suttas emphasize the four jhānas as the path to liberation, unique to Buddhism and discovered by the Buddha himself.




# 1.2.2 The Meditative Practice Of The Brahmin Pārāsariya

* The suttas presenting the path of the bodhisatta may be seen as an implicit form of criticizing certain practices.
* Bronkhorst (1986: 26) has rightly pointed out the significance of a fragment contained in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta (MN 152).
* In this sutta, the Buddha is talking with Uttara, who informs him about the contemplative practice taught by the Brahmin Pārāsariya, which is supposed to lead to the development of the sense faculties.
* After hearing this description, the Buddha ridicules Pārāsariya's method of developing the senses.
* The Indriyabhāvanā Sutta instead praises the proper method of the development of the senses preached by the Buddha himself.

* It may be therefore the case, that this sutta is directed against all the contemplative practices leading to altered states of consciousness, including the four jhānas.
* After the explicit critique of Pārāsariya's method, the Buddha describes his own method of cultivating the faculties.
* This practice has nothing at all to do with the four jhānas.

* A comparison with the stock description of the third jhāna may be helpful in this regard:
* The states of sati, *sampajañña*, and *upekkhā* present in the third jhāna directly correspond to those described in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta.

* It is also worth mentioning that the fourth jhāna is described as the attainment of the purity of *sati* and *upekkhā*, so there is also a strong correspondence to that state.
* The highest stage of *indriyabhāvanā* directly corresponds to the state of the third jhāna, and probably to the fourth as well.

* This assumption may be backed up by the fact, that the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta ends with an exhortation to practice jhāna.
* Taking all the above considerations into account it seems right to assume that the criticized method of meditation preached by the Brahmin Pārāsariya was standing in a direct opposition to the four jhānas.

#  The Nature Of The Jhānas

* The view that jhāna is connected with the stopping of the senses is one of these 'obvious' truths about Buddhist meditation, that are taken for granted.
* Fortunately, there is a sutta which deals explicitly with this issue. The Mahātan. hāsan. khaya Sutta contains a following fragment:

* This passage makes it very clear that in the state of the fourth jhāna, the senses of the meditator are not coming to a halt. On the contrary, they are functioning in a smooth, continuous way, because their activity is not disrupted by the arising of lust or aversion directed towards their objects.


## 1.2.3 Initial Conclusions

* Bronkhorst analyzes suttas describing Jain practices and theory.
* Jainas are described as standing erect, refusing to sit, experiencing sharp feelings.
* They justify these austerities by claiming they destroy past evil actions and prevent new ones.
* Jain teachings emphasize the destruction of all actions through asceticism.

* Bronkhorst proposes that ascetic practices rejected by the bodhisatta aimed at non-activity.
* These practices included stopping breathing, shutting down senses, crushing the mind, abstaining from food.
* States taught by Āl.āra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta also fit this category.

* The author suggests further investigation into meditative practices of non-Buddhists during the Buddha's time.
* This would involve analyzing scriptures of surviving non-Buddhist traditions.
* The author intends to analyze the problem from a different angle than Bronkhorst and highlight another criticized meditative method in the Suttapitaka.



## 1.2.4 The Significance Of The Sandha Sutta

* This sutta criticizes a method of attaining jhana by comparing it to an unbroken colt (*assa*) and praises another method likened to a thoroughbred (*ājānīya*).
* The wrong jhāna is characterized by clinging to objects like earth, water, fire, etc., while the right jhāna transcends these supports.

* The sutta describes the jhāna of a thoroughbred as being attained without relying on any external object or perception. Even deities like Indra and Pajāpati are unable to comprehend this state.
* The presence of Indra and Pajāpati in the sutta suggests its antiquity, possibly predating later developments in Buddhist mythology.

* The same verse praising the jhāna of a thoroughbred is found in the Khajjanīya Sutta, which focuses on understanding the five *khandhas*. This indicates that the Sandha Sutta might be an earlier source for this verse.
* The traditional view identifies the jhāna of a thoroughbred as a transcendental (*lokuttara*) jhāna accessible only to liberated individuals.

* However, the Sandha Sutta presents the jhāna of a thoroughbred as something that requires instruction, suggesting it's not exclusive to liberated persons.
* The sutta offers only two options: practicing jhāna with or without support. This implies that the four jhānas, central to early Buddhist practice, likely correspond to the jhāna of a thoroughbred.

# Two Descriptions of Jhāna

* The definition of the four jhānas does not mention anything about not perceiving objects or meditating without support.
* The description of the jhāna of a thoroughbred says nothing about the qualities of the four jhānas, like sati, sampajañña, *sukha*, and *upekkhā*.

# Comparing the Sandha Sutta, Gopakamoggallāna Sutta, and Sāmaññaphala Scheme

* The Sandha Sutta describes a "jhāna of an unbroken colt" which should not be practiced, and a "jhāna of a thoroughbred" which should be practiced.
* The Gopakamoggallāna Sutta distinguishes between a jhāna that deserves criticism and one that deserves praise.
* The Sāmaññaphala Scheme describes how a bhikkhu seeks out a secluded dwelling and abandons the five *nīvaran.* as, leading to the attainment of the four jhānas.

# Implications for Understanding Jhāna

* The Sandha Sutta suggests that attaining absorption with the support of perceived objects was seen as a wrong form of meditation in early Buddhism.
* This contradicts the traditional view that jhāna is achieved through concentration on a special object.
* The Sandha Sutta explicitly denies that the "jhāna of an unbroken colt" is a less perfect stage leading to the four jhānas.

# Conclusion


* Early Buddhists criticized certain forms of meditation, including those relying on perceived objects for absorption.
* This sheds light on the nature of the four jhānas and their practice in early Buddhism.

# Early Buddhist Rejection of Certain Meditative Practices

* Early Buddhists rejected meditative practices that heavily restrained mental activity, including those involving stopping breathing and sensory functions.
* They also rejected meditation reliant on perceived objects.
* The four jhānas were intended to be free from these criticized features.

# Comparison with Non-Buddhist Practices

* The text aims to determine if the criticized practices were truly part of other sects' meditative systems.
* It seeks to find similarities between non-Buddhist scriptures and the four jhānas of early Buddhism.

# Criticized Meditative Practices and Their Buddhist Counterparts

* A table outlines specific criticized practices (e.g., "base of nothingness," breathless meditation) and their corresponding positive counterparts in Buddhist teachings, primarily the four jhānas.

# Non-Buddhist Meditation Traditions

* Hindu scriptures provide the most detailed information on non-Buddhist meditation, potentially creating a biased view.
* Pāli suttas suggest a diverse range of non-Buddhist and non-Brahminic spiritual movements with unique meditative systems during the Buddha's time.
* Jainism is the only surviving movement besides Hinduism that offers some insight into its meditative teachings.




# 1.3 Yogic Meditation In The Scriptures Of The Non-Buddhists

* The Upanishads do not contain detailed descriptions of meditative techniques like the Pali Suttas.
* Jainism's concept of liberation through exhaustion of *karman* differs from the Upanishadic view.
* The Upanishads emphasize knowledge of *brahman* as the path to liberation, a novel idea at the time.

* Yogic meditation was likely introduced to the Upanishads from non-Vedic sources.
* The Katha Upanishad (KU) presents early descriptions of yoga, comparing senses to horses and mind to a charioteer.
* KU defines yoga as restraining the senses and intellect, similar to methods criticized in Pali Suttas.

* The Svetasvatara Upanishad (SU) portrays a theistic view, advocating meditation on OM. to visualize God.
* SU connects yoga with realizing the nature of *brahman*, leading to liberation from bonds.
* Yoga becomes central in the Maitri Upanishad (MU), described as a sixfold practice leading to *brahman* vision.

* MU details techniques like breath control, sense withdrawal, and focusing on OM.
* The text mentions pressing the tongue against the palate and stopping breaths, potentially explaining Pali Sutta descriptions.

* MU emphasizes meditating on both the syllable OM. and the ineffable aspect of *brahman*.




## # Yogic Meditation In The Upanisads

* This section describes yogic meditation as presented in the Upanishads, particularly Maitrī.
* It highlights the connection between breath control, sense withdrawal, and achieving a state of unity.
* The text explains how the Upanishads reinterpret Vedic sacrificial rituals by connecting them with meditative practices.

## # 1.3.2 Yogic Meditation In The Yoga-Sūtras Of Patañjali

* This section explores yogic meditation as described in Patañjali's Yoga-Sutras.
* It outlines the eightfold yoga, comparing it to the practices mentioned in Maitrī Upanishad.
* The text notes that the Yoga-Sutras offer limited detailed descriptions of meditative techniques compared to other sources like Maitrī.
* It discusses pratyāhāra (sense withdrawal), prānāyāma (breath control), dhāraṇā (concentration), and samādhi (absorption) as described in the Yoga-Sutras, drawing comparisons with earlier texts.
* The section emphasizes the integration of yogic methods with the concept of liberating knowledge in the Yoga-Sutras.

## # Soteriology Of Yoga-Sūtras


* This section delves into the soteriological framework of the Yoga-Sutras.
* It introduces the dualist metaphysics of Samkhya-Yoga, explaining the concepts of puruṣa (the absolute Subject) and prakriti (the sphere of objectivity).
* The text describes how misunderstanding the relationship between puruṣa and prakriti leads to suffering.
* It outlines the goal of yoga as achieving insight into the true nature of self and restraining the fluctuations of consciousness.
* Finally, it explains the process of attaining kaivalya (aloneness) through different stages of samādhi.

## 1.3.3 Yogic Meditation In The Bhavagad Gītā

* The Bhavagad Gītā criticizes the Jain idea of liberation through non-activity, advocating for action without attachment and sacrifice of fruits.
*  Devotion to Lord Kr.s.n.a is presented as the easiest way to achieve this state.
* The concepts of *purus.a* and *prakr.ti* are reinterpreted as forms of Kr.s.n.a, rejecting their independent metaphysical status.

* The Bhavagad Gītā describes various paths to liberation, including yoga in its traditional sense.
* Meditation techniques like making the mind one-pointed, controlling senses, and gazing at the tip of the nose are outlined (BG 6.11–13).
* Pratyāhāra is described as offering senses and their objects into the "fires" of restraint (BG 5.26–27).

* Prān. *āyāma* is presented similarly, with in-breaths and out-breaths offered through absorption (BG 4.29).
* Constant meditation on Kr.s.n.a is encouraged (BG 8.7–8).
* A comprehensive description of yoga incorporating sense restraint, breath control, mind stillness, and mantra meditation (OM) while focusing on Kr.s.n.a is given (BG 8.12–13).



## 68  •  Jhāna And Yoga 1.3.4 Yogic Meditation In The Yogic Upanis.Ads

* These texts are younger than the Maitrī Upanis.ad.
* They are technical in nature and lack theoretical sophistication.
* Yoga occupies a central place in these texts.

## Yogic Upanisads and Jñāna

* Amr.tabindu Upanis.ad (ABU) identifies yoga with *jñāna*.
* ABU 7 suggests practicing concentration on OM. first through its letters, then without them to attain the idea of non-entity.

## Nādabindu Upanis.ad and Auditory Meditation

* Compares the syllable OM. to a bird, its letters to bodily parts.
* Describes a state where the mind transcends organs, becoming absorbed with no separate existence or mental action.
* Details a practice involving hearing internal sound through the right ear, leading to deafness to external sounds.
* Mentions experiencing various sounds during practice, progressing from loud oceanic sounds to subtle ones like musical instruments.

## Dhyānabindu Upanis.ad and Visualization

* Describes sixfold yoga: āsana, prān. āyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāran. ā, *dhyāna*, and *samādhi*.
* Advises restraining breath connected with uttering OM. until both cease naturally.
* Contains detailed visualization practices, including an elaborate description of the lotus of the heart with its colored petals and mystical meanings.

## Yogatattva Upanis.ad and the Interdependence of Yoga and Jñāna

* Attempts to reconcile yoga and *jñāna*, stating they are mutually interdependent for attaining liberation (moks.a).
* Describes the eightfold set of elements of yoga, identical to those in the Yoga-sūtras.
* Explains meditation on OM. as destroying obstacles and former sins.

## New Elements in Yogic Upanisads

* Meditation objects possess special function and hidden meaning.
* Visualization becomes a crucial technique with complex visualized objects.
* Mantra OM. consists of several parts requiring contemplation.
* Mantra meditation leads to hearing mystical sounds.
* Meditative methods are based on homology, connecting elements, mantras, deities, body parts, and colors.

## Influence of Tantrism

* New elements in Yogic Upanisads may be attributed to tantrism's influence.
* Old yogic methods are modified and reinterpreted.

## Continuity with Early Buddhist Suttas

* Meditative methods criticized in early Buddhist suttas remain present and important in Yogic Upanisads.

## 1.3.5 Jainism And Yoga

* Bronkhorst suggests that meditative methods criticized in Buddhist suttas may be linked with Jainas, based on analysis of Jain meditative scriptures.
* Early Jain meditation aimed to stop all bodily and mental activities, including breathing, similar to early Hindu scriptures.
* Bronkhorst proposes a 'main stream of meditation' encompassing both Jain and early Hindu teachings, which underwent transformation in Hinduism with the development of liberating knowledge.

* This transformation led to meditation becoming the main method for liberation, while bodily practices were set aside.
* Hatha Yoga represents a new current that reinterprets meditative terms to refer to bodily practices.
* Bronkhorst's views are criticized by Wynne who argues that he conflates evidence from different texts and misunderstands the early Brahminic meditative tradition.

* Wynne claims that realization of *ātman* was the main goal, and cessation of bodily activity was never a goal in itself.
* There are issues with Bronkhorst's interpretation of Jain meditative texts, particularly regarding Uttarajjhayan. 29.72 which describes a unique type of meditation for conscious dying.

* Other texts used by Bronkhorst to support the idea of stopping senses in Jainism are problematic as they describe overcoming emotional reactions rather than halting senses.
* The term *dhyāna* in Jain texts often refers to 'thinking' or 'pondering over', and only the fourth type of *dhyāna* seems related to meditation proper.

* Bronkhorst believes later generations misunderstood earlier fragments on meditation, but the Āyāram. ga Sutta suggests meditation played a relatively small role in Jainism.
* Bronkhorst considers Jain soteriological system as the original context for practices rejected by early Buddhists, aiming to ridicule Jainas.

* He believes purely ascetic practices were vital parts of the 'main stream of meditation', leading him to consider later Hindu meditative traditions as reinterpretations.
* Bronkhorst's argument relies on descriptions of painfulness in Pāli suttas and pleasantness in yogic scriptures, attributing the latter to Buddhist influence.

* However, numerous yogic scriptures describe meditation as blissful, a view shared by modern proponents.
* Bronkhorst emphasizes motionlessness as a key feature, but this is also present in early Buddhist practices.




# 1.3.6 Seeking For The Original Soteriological Context Of Yogic Meditation
* All Hindu meditative scriptures describe the same practices, but in different contexts.
* There is no original soteriological context for these practices; they are a "yogic hard core" of methods that work to alter body and consciousness.
* This "hard core" includes focusing on a single object, restraining breathing, and stopping the activity of senses and mind.

* These methods are efficient and can be described in a plain and comprehensive manner.
* Focusing on a single object is a main method, as pointed out by Eliade.
* Stopping the activity of senses was not a method in itself but developed gradually through absorption into the meditation object.
* Breath retention could be developed independently through special exercises.

* All these elements have crucial psychological meaning and were connected organically.
* Perfection of posture and breath control are prerequisites for successful yogic meditation.
* This allows for strong concentration, leading to decreased awareness of sensory impressions.
* Breath retention has a deep psychological meaning, connecting breathing, states of mind, and sense activity.

* In the final stage of concentration, senses, mind, and breathing come to a standstill.
* This process is connected with psychological effects like joy and fading selfhood.
* All soteriological systems are theoretical interpretations of this "hard core."
* Jain soteriology focused on motionlessness and inactivity, neglecting pleasant feelings arising from practice.

* Later Jain texts acknowledge subtle enjoyment during meditation.
* Hindu yoga tradition sought insight into the true self through absorption and fading of "I-ness".
* Higher stages of absorption were seen as realization of this goal.





## 1.3.7 Buddhist Influence In The Yogic Scriptures

* Yoga had become a dominant element in Indian spirituality, and its methods of meditation are found in Hindu meditative traditions.
* While some similarities exist between yogic practices and early Buddhist descriptions of jhānas, Bronkhorst argues that Buddhist influence on yoga is superficial.
* A passage in the Mahābhārata mentions "fourfold *dhyāna* yoga," but only the first *dhyāna* is described, and it resembles a negative counterpart to Buddhist jhānas.

##  The Influence of Buddhism on Yoga-sūtras

* Bronkhorst suggests stronger Buddhist influence in the Yoga-sūtras, pointing to similarities in terminology like *vitarka*, *vicāra*, and *ānanda*.
* However, YS 1.17 describes a state of concentration that contradicts the main goal of yoga (suppressing fluctuations of consciousness).
* Bronkhorst argues that this sūtra and two following ones are from a different context, possibly Buddhist.

## Further Evidence of Buddhist Influence

* YS 2.3 lists *asmitā* as a cause of affliction (*kleśa*), contradicting YS 1.17 where it's a positive factor.
* YS 1.19 mentions *āsamprajñāta sāmadhi* preceded by faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, mirroring Buddhist descriptions of five *indriyas* (faculties) and five *balas* (strengths).
* YS 1.33 describes four qualities (*maitrī*, *karun. ā*, *muditā*, and *upeks.a*) found in the Pāli Canon as the four *brahamavihāras*.

## Direct Borrowing from Buddhist Suttas

* YS 2.5 defines ignorance (*avidyā*) similarly to how it's described in Pāli suttas, seeing impermanent as permanent, impure as pure, painful as pleasant, and not-self as self.
* A fragment in the Vipallāsa Sutta directly corresponds to YS 2.5.

##  Influence on Yoga Bhās.ya

* Vyāsa, commenting on YS 2.54, lists a method of practicing *pratyāhāra* that aligns with early Buddhist methods of developing *indriyas*, but contradicts the main tone of the Yoga-sūtras.
* Bronkhorst finds traces of Buddhist influence in other Hindu scriptures like Yogakun. dali Upanis.ad and Muktikā Upanis.ad, where destruction of *vāsanās* (subliminal traits) is described similarly to the destruction of *āsavas* in Buddhism.

##  Limitations of Buddhist Influence

* Bronkhorst concludes that Buddhist influence on Hindu meditative tradition was limited to borrowing terminology.
* No equivalent of the four jhānas is found in Hindu scriptures, and practices criticized in Pāli suttas are central to Hindu meditation.





## 1.4 Investigating The Authenticity Of The 'Bodhisatta Suttas'

* Bronkhorst questions the authenticity of the "bodhisatta suttas," believing they are not verbatim words of the Buddha but a polemic against non-Buddhist practices.
* He doubts the historicity of the account of the bodhisatta's training with Ālāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, suggesting it was added later to give meaning to their names.

## 1.4.1 Āl.Āra Kālāma And Uddaka Rāmaputta

* Bronkhorst argues that the account of training with these teachers is a later addition based on:
    * Its presence in multiple scriptures, but absence when the Buddha considers potential disciples.
    * The similarity of descriptions for both teachers, suggesting fabrication.
* Bareau supports this view, citing the absence of the training account in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya as evidence.

* Wynne challenges these arguments:
    * He argues that the absence of the account in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya doesn't prove its inauthenticity but could be due to later modifications by redactors.
    * He points out that the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya focuses on the bodhisatta's awakening and not his pre-awakening practices, similar to the Theravādin Vinaya.

* Wynne further argues:
    * The repetitive nature of the training accounts doesn't necessarily indicate fabrication but could be due to their original inclusion in a single biographical account.
    * The unique details in the account of Uddaka Rāmaputta, mentioning a separate figure named Rāma, suggest historical accuracy and an effort to differentiate them.

* Wynne concludes that the accounts likely preserve valuable historical information about these teachers:
    * Ālāra Kālāma's association with the Kālāmas and their location near Kapilavatthu suggests proximity to the Buddha.
    * Bharan. d. u-Kālāma, mentioned as a companion of the Buddha and possibly a student of Ālāra, further supports this connection.

* Uddaka Rāmaputta is also mentioned in other suttas:
    * The Uddaka Sutta portrays him as wise and an all-conqueror, though the Buddha reinterprets these terms.
    * The Vassakāra Sutta refers to a "saman. a Rāmaputta" as an advisor to King Eleyya.

# 1.4.2 The Description Of The Breathless Meditation

* Uddaka's location in Rājagaha, as suggested by the Mahāvastu, aligns with the depiction of Ālāra in Kapilavatthu in the 'bodhisatta suttas'.

* This placement makes Gotama's visits to both teachers seem natural and expected.
* Bronkhorst argues that the account of the bodhisatta's strivings is not original but a Buddhist polemic against Jain practices, particularly those related to bodily austerities.
* He points out similarities between descriptions of the effects of breathless meditation in 'bodhisatta suttas' and accounts of illness in other suttas.

* Bronkhorst suggests that these descriptions were inserted later as a critique of Jain practices.
* However, Swami Rama's book on Hindu yogic techniques reveals similar side effects associated with advanced prānāyāma practices.




# The head sounds heard during the practice of prān. āyāma are caused by the rushing of blood through the arteries and veins and may indicate congestion

* Head sounds are caused by blood flow.
* They may signal congestion.

# In this practice of prān. āyāma, the air will eventually be able to enter the esophagus and stomach in small quantities and will finally reach the bowels

* Air enters the digestive system.
* Initial pain is expected but subsides with practice.

# In the beginning one will also perspire freely

* Sweating is a common initial side effect.

# Kumbhaka increases heat in the body

* Holding breath generates heat.
* Tingling and stinging sensations may occur throughout the body.

# The teeth should be firmly pressed together during the entire round of practice

* Teeth clenching is part of the technique.

# As one develops the practice the diet must be further simplified and should eventually consist almost entirely of liquids

* Dietary restrictions are necessary as practice progresses.



## 1.4.3 Ascetic Practices In The Māhasīhanāda Sutta

* Bronkhorst suggests the description of reduced food intake in this sutta is borrowed from another context, possibly the Shˆn mao hsi shu ching.
* The account in the Māhasīhanāda Sutta describes extreme austerities like sleeping on spiked mattresses and going naked, aiming to torment the body rather than meditate.
* This account shares striking similarities with the Jain Āyāram. ga Sutta, suggesting possible borrowing or influence.

* Similarities include descriptions of nudity, ignoring requests, enduring abuse, exposure to elements, and strict dietary practices.
* The extent of these similarities makes coincidence unlikely, implying potential copying from Jain practices.

* However, it's improbable that the Buddha experienced exactly the same events as Mahāvīra.
* Asceticism was central to Jainism, so descriptions of Mahāvīra's hardships likely predate accounts of the Buddha's austerities.
* The Māhasīhanāda Sutta might have been influenced by Jain asceticism to appeal to Jaina converts.

* The account in the Māhasīhanāda Sutta contradicts the account of strivings in 'bodhisatta suttas'.
* It's impossible to fit all the austerities described into the Buddha's short period of striving near Uruvelā.
* Some austerities seem exaggerated, and the text places some in previous lives using a late concept of Pure Abodes.

* The sutta contains an auto-reference, calling itself the Hair-raising Discourse, which is unusual and resembles elements of Mahāyāna Sutras.
* This suggests the account in the Māhasīhanāda Sutta might be later than the account in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta.

## 1.4.4 Ariyapariyesana Or Bodhirājakumāra: The Quest For The Original 'Bodhisatta Sutta'

* Wynne argues that the Ariyapariyesana Sutta is likely the oldest account of the Buddha's awakening due to its unique characteristics.
* He points out peculiarities in the text, such as the use of the form "*huveyya*" and the absence of a detailed account of the bodhisatta's strivings.

* Wynne suggests that these peculiarities indicate the sutta was closed to modifications early on, possibly because it was already considered an authoritative account.
* He also argues that the simplicity of the awakening formula in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta supports its antiquity.

##  


# The Missing Information

* The descriptions of the five bhikkhus in both 'bodhisatta suttas' are crucial to understanding the differences between them.
* In the Ariyapariyesana Sutta, the appearance and reactions of the five bhikkhus seem out of place and unexplained.
* They seem to know the Buddha well, but their relationship is not established earlier in the sutta.

# The Bodhirājakumāra Sutta as a Source

* The missing information from the Ariyapariyesana Sutta can be found in the account of the strivings in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta.
* Each unclear fragment in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta corresponds to a relevant fragment in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta's account of the strivings.

# A Deliberate Omission?

* It is likely that the episode of the strivings was deliberately removed from the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.
* This removal might be explained by the second part of the Ariyapariyesana Sutta, which describes a method to blind Māra through meditative absorption.

# The Importance of *saññāvedayitanirodha*

* The Ariyapariyesana Sutta emphasizes *saññāvedayitanirodha* as the ultimate liberating state.
* This view makes the account of liberation in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta inconvenient because it does not mention *saññāvedayitanirodha*.

# Conflicting Accounts of Liberation

* The Bodhirājakumāra Sutta describes liberation happening after attaining the fourth jhāna.
* The Ariyapariyesana Sutta describes liberation through seeing with wisdom in *saññāvedayitanirodha*, a state beyond the four jhānas.

# The Problem with Ariyapariyesana Sutta as the Earliest Account

* The Ariyapariyesana Sutta presents a scheme where mastery of the first four jhānas is necessary for attaining higher stages like nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception.
* This contradicts the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, which depicts the bodhisatta achieving these higher stages before mastering the jhānas.

# Inconsistencies with Saññāvedayitanirodha

* The Ariyapariyesana Sutta's scheme may have been inconvenient for someone who believed *saññāvedayitanirodha* (cessation of feeling and perception) was the ultimate goal of meditation.
* The Bodhirājakumāra Sutta describes the bodhisatta rejecting practices similar to *saññāvedayitanirodha*, suggesting an earlier rejection of this view.

# Wynne's Argument on Simplicity

* Wynne argues that the Ariyapariyesana Sutta's simple formula for awakening indicates its earliness.
* This argument is flawed because simplicity doesn't always equate to earliness, and the text focuses more on the surroundings than the Buddha's enlightenment experience.

# Comparison with Bodhirājakumāra Sutta

* The Bodhirājakumāra Sutta provides a more detailed account of the bodhisatta's strivings before awakening, which aligns better with the concept of striving being essential for liberation.
* The descriptions of the five bhikkhus' liberation in both suttas differ, with the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta's description aligning more closely with the Buddha's teaching.

# Conclusion

* The Bodhirājakumāra Sutta likely contains an earlier and more original account of the Buddha's awakening than the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.
* While the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta may have undergone later modifications, its core elements likely predate those in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta.

#  The Buddha's Renunciation

* The text describes different accounts of why the Buddha renounced household life and became a monk.
* Some suttas mention his realization that seeking impermanent things leads to dissatisfaction, prompting him to seek enlightenment (Nibbāna).
* Others highlight the perceived difficulties of practicing holiness within a home environment.
* The earliest account, found in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, simply states the decision to renounce without providing motivation.

# 2. The Four Jhānas And The Meditative Teachings Of Theravāda Buddhism

* This section will investigate the Visuddhimagga's theory of meditation, focusing on jhāna.
* It will examine the nature, role, and development methods of jhāna.
* A comparison will be made between the Visuddhimagga's portrayal of jhāna and its depiction in Pāli suttas to understand how the understanding of jhāna has evolved. 


## Investigating The Orthodox Theory Of Meditation...  •  105

**2.1 Investigating The Orthodox Theory Of Meditation Presented In The Visuddhimagga**
* The Visuddhimagga emphasizes that jhāna can only be developed with a meditation subject.
* There are two types of meditation subjects: generally useful and specific.
* Generally useful subjects include loving-kindness, recollection of death, and perception of repulsiveness in food.

**2.1.1 *kasin.* a meditation in the visuddhimagga**
* The Visuddhimagga distinguishes forty special subjects of meditations, including ten *kasin.* as.
* *Kasin.* a meditation occupies a central spot in the Visuddhimagga and involves meditative devices representing basic qualities of the world.
* There are ten *kasin.* as: earth, water, air, fire, blue, yellow, red, white, limited space, and light.

* The development process for each *kasin.* a is similar:
    * Prepare the *kasin.* a object (e.g., clay disc for earth *kasin.* a).
    * Contemplate dangers of sensual desires and arouse longing to escape them.
    * Arouse joy by remembering Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.
    * Arouse rapture realizing you are on the path followed by Buddhas.

* Focus on the sign (*nimitta*) of the *kasin.* a, expanding it without visualization.
* The mind should focus on the conceptual name of the *kasin.* a, relegating the color to a property.
* This process leads to *uggahanimitta* (learning sign) which is equally vivid with open or closed eyes.

* Further practice leads to *pat.ibhāganimitta* (counterpart sign), appearing when hindrances (*nīvaran.* as) are blocked and access concentration is achieved.
* Each *kasin.* a has unique learning and counterpart signs.

**The Five Hindrances (*nīvaran.* as)**
* Kāmacchanda (sensual desire) prevents focus on the meditative object.
* Byāpāda (ill will) disturbs the mind.
* Thīna-middha (sloth and torpor) make the mind unwieldy.
* Uddhacca-kukucca (restlessness and worry) make the mind unquiet.
* Vicikicchā (doubts) prevent jhāna attainment.

**The Five Jhāna Factors**
* Applied thought (*vitakka*) directs the mind onto an object, like striking a bell.
* Sustained thought (*vicāra*) keeps consciousness anchored on the object, like the ringing of the bell.
* Rapture (*pīti*), happiness (*sukha*), and one-pointedness of mind (cittass' ekaggatā) also contribute to jhāna attainment.

# Vitakka and Vicara

- Vitakka is like a bird spreading its wings.
- Vicara is like a bird gliding in the open air with wings spread wide.
- Vitakka is like a hand firmly grabbing a plate.
- Vicara is like a hand rubbing a plate with oil.

# Rapture (Piti)

- Refreshes the body and mind.
- Its function is to pervade (fill with rapture).
- It has a characteristic of endearing.
- Several kinds: minor, momentary, uplifting, pervading.

# Pleasure (Sukha)

- Described as pleasing.
- Completely devours and consumes bodily and mental affliction.
- Differs from piti in that piti belongs to the samkhata group while sukha belongs to vedana group.
- Piti is like contentedness resulting from getting a desired object, while sukha is like experiencing it once acquired.

# One-Pointedness of Mind (Cittass' Ekaggatā)

- Last of the five jhana factors.
- Describes the main feature of samatha meditation - focusing on a single object.
- Can be identified with concentration (samadhi).
- Centers consciousness and its concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object.

# Hindrances and Jhana Factors

- Five jhana factors conquer five nivaranas.
- Each jhana factor eliminates one nivarana.
- One-pointedness is incompatible with kamacchanda, piti with byapada, vitakka with thina-middha, sukha with udhacca-kukucca, and vicara with vicikiccha.

# Counterpart Sign (Pat.ibhāganimitta)

- Appears when hindrances are suppressed by jhana factors.
- Signals the attainment of upacāra samādhi (access concentration).
- Two types of concentration: access concentration and absorption concentration (appanā samādhi), present in jhana.

# Extension of the Sign

- Meditator should delimit with mind successive sizes for the sign.
- Should not extend it without delimiting.
- Can be expanded to the extreme limit of the world sphere or beyond.

# Cognitive Process During Absorption

- Visuddhimagga analyzes cognitive process during absorption using terms and concepts from late Abhidhammic thought.
- Normal experience can be dissected into momentary states of mind (citta or citt'uppada).

# Life Continuum (Bhavana)

- Passive mental stream underlying active mental processes.
- Arises in the mother's womb at conception.
- Rooted in ignorance, supported by desire to exist.

# Attainment of Jhāna

- When mind is free from hindrances and ready for absorption concentration, it receives stimulation.
- Three moments of bhavana occur: normal functioning, vibration, cutting off.
- Mind then adverts to the object of meditation (counterpart sign).
- Four or five pulsations (javana) occur, associated with strong jhana factors.

# Reviewing (Paccavekkhati)

- Mental procedure after leaving a jhana state.
- Concerned with imperfections of attained level and starting point for higher absorption.

# Second Jhāna

- Attained by surmounting vitakka and vicara.
- Defined as abandoning two factors, possessing three: sukha, piti, cittass' ekaggatā.

# Third Jhāna

- Attained by surmounting piti.
- Possesses two factors: sukha and cittass' ekaggatā.
- Equanimity (upekkhā) arises as a feeling and factor.

# Fourth Jhāna

- Attained by surmounting sukha.
- Possesses one factor: cittass' ekaggatā.

# The Fourth Jhāna

* The fourth jhāna abandons *sukha* (pleasure) and possesses *ekaggatā* (one-pointedness) and *upekkhā* (*equanimity*).
* *Upekkhā* in the fourth jhāna is strong enough to purify mindfulness.
* Abandoning of *sukha* and *dukkha* refers to abandoning bodily pleasure and pain.

# Kasinas as Meditation Objects

* *Kasinas* are meditation objects that can lead to all four jhānas.
* Different *kasinas* are suitable for different character types.
* Four color *kasinas* are helpful for meditators with hateful characters.

# The Fourth Jhāna and the Arūpas

* According to Buddhaghosa, all four *arūpas* (formless absorptions) possess the factors of the fourth jhāna.
* The four *arūpas* are considered modifications of the fourth jhāna.

# Attaining the Arūpas

* To attain the first *arūpa* (base of infinite space), one must achieve the fourth jhāna and then review its limitations.
* The meditator should remove the *kasina* sign and direct attention to the space it occupied.
* This process is repeated for each subsequent *arūpa*, surmounting the object of the preceding stage.

# Factors in Arūpas

* Although objects change, the factors (*vitakka* and *vicāra*) remain the same in all four *arūpas*.
* The presence of *vitakka* and *vicāra* is explained by the need to grasp the formless objects with the mind.
* Attainment of higher *arūpas* involves emerging from the preceding absorption, temporarily returning to normal consciousness.

## 2.1.2 The Arūpas And The Jhānas In The Suttapit.Aka

* This section examines the relationship between arūpas and jhānas in the suttas, contrasting it with the Visuddhimagga's theory.
* While the Visuddhimagga presents a coherent system of eight stages leading to the four samāpattis (seen as modalities of the fourth jhāna), the suttas often present the four jhānas independently of the arūpas.

* The Gāvīupamā Sutta emphasizes the need for mastery of each stage before progressing to the next, comparing a meditator who skips stages to a cow unable to reach its desired pasture.
* However, the bodhisatta suttas challenge this view by depicting the bodhisatta attaining the base of nothingness and the base of neither perception nor non-perception before mastering the four jhānas.

* This suggests that the four jhānas are not prerequisites for achieving these higher states, contradicting the Visuddhimagga's model.
* The bodhisatta suttas may be seen as an authentic account of Gotama's path to liberation, implying that in early Buddhism, jhānas and arūpas were not considered part of the same meditative attainment set.

##  The Four Jhānas in the Suttas

* This section explores instances where the four jhānas appear independently of the arūpas in various suttas.
* The bodhisatta's path to liberation emphasizes the four jhānas as crucial for achieving mental pliancy and ultimately, liberation through the destruction of āsavas.

* The Sāmaññaphala Scheme, prominent in the Dīgha Nikāya and Majjhima Nikāya, also highlights the four jhānas as a key step towards liberation, preceded by various wholesome factors and qualities.
* Numerous schematic sets within the suttas list the four jhānas as essential components for achieving enlightenment:

    * The Noble Eightfold Path
    * The Five Indriyas (faculties)
    * The Five Balas (strengths)
    * The Pañcan. gikasamādhi Sutta's fivefold noble concentration
    * The Pat.hamasikkhattaya Sutta's three trainings

* While the seven factors of awakening don't explicitly mention jhānas, their components can be traced back to the defining characteristics of the four jhānas.


## Arūpas in Isolation

* This section investigates instances where arūpas appear independently of jhānas in the suttas, as researched by Bronkhorst.
* Four sets are identified:

    * The eight liberations: a gradual reduction of perception culminating in its disappearance.
    * The seven stations of consciousness: similar to the eight liberations but excluding the last two stages.
    * Two realms corresponding to the missing stages from the seven stations: the realm of non-percipient beings and the realm of neither perception nor non-perception.

## The Relationship Between Jhānas and Arūpas

* This section explores the historical development of the relationship between jhānas (states of meditative absorption) and arūpas (formless realms).

* Early Buddhist texts often present these concepts separately, with jhānas appearing in their own context and arūpas appearing in various unique sets.

* The four jhānas are consistently presented as a fixed set across the Suttapitaka, while arūpa presentations vary significantly.

* Jhānas are deeply integrated into the path to liberation, while the soteriological role of arūpas is often unclear.

* Early Abhidhamma lists only include jhānas, suggesting an initial separation between these concepts.

## Proposed Assimilation of Jhānas and Arūpas

* Bronkhorst suggests that ancient Buddhists attempted to connect stages from both sets, possibly identifying the second jhāna with the base of neither perception nor non-perception due to their shared characteristic of reduced mental activity.

* This theory is supported by a passage in the Citta Samyutta where Nigantha Nataputta questions the existence of concentration without vitakka and vicāra (mental fabrication), which aligns with the second jhāna's characteristics.

* However, this assimilation may be problematic due to the late dating of the Citta Samyutta and the established nature of the combined jhāna-arūpa set by that time.

## Unifying Principles for Jhānas and Arūpas

* The merging of jhānas and arūpas led to a search for a unifying principle to explain their progression.

* The Potthapada Sutta explains progress through jhānas as the cessation of perceptions associated with each state, reinterpreting jhāna states as mere perceptions.

* This reinterpretation seems like an intermediary stage in the development of understanding these concepts.

* Another attempt at unification is found in the Sangiti Sutta's list of nine successive cessations, which includes both arūpas and a final cessation stage.




# The Cessation of Perceptions

* In each jhāna, specific perceptions cease.
* Breathing ceases in the fourth jhāna.
* This scheme lists factors that drop during meditation.

# Nine Successive Abidings

* Consists of four jhānas, four *arūpas*, and *saññāvedayitanirodha*.
* Doesn't mention ceasing factors; simply enumerates stages.

# Justifications for Nine Abidings

* Some suttas describe progress through surmounting preceding stages (Cūl.agosin. ga Sutta, Lat.ukikopama Sutta).
* Bahuvedaniya Sutta describes each stage as a "loftier and more sublime pleasure" than the previous one, even *saññāvedayitanirodha*.

# Original Sets of Jhānas

* The jhānas and *arūpas* were likely originally separate sets.
* Numerical schemes like the Noble Eightfold Path explicitly defined the four jhānas, preventing additions.
* In contexts like the Sāmaññaphala Scheme, the connection between the fourth jhāna and liberating insight prevented adding *arūpas*.

# Attempts to Introduce Arūpas

* Pot.t.hapāda Sutta adds *arūpas* but ends abruptly because a pliant mind can't exist in cessation.
* Gāvīupamā Sutta connects nine abidings with Sāmaññaphala Scheme, leading to an awkward result of a pliant mind after cessation.

# Pious Forgery

* Memorization errors and good intentions could lead to adding *arūpas* to suttas originally containing only four jhānas.
* Mahāparinibbāna Sutta shows a possible example of such forgery in the Buddha's final meditation.




# The Buddha's Parinibbāna and the Development of Jhāna Theory

* The text argues that the Buddha likely attained parinibbāna in the fourth jhāna, a state considered special in early Buddhism.
* Later developments introduced the arūpas (formless realms) and saññāvedayitanirodha (cessation of perception and feeling), elevating them above the jhānas.
* This created a conflict with the tradition of the Buddha attaining parinibbāna in the fourth jhāna.

# The Problematic Account in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta

* To reconcile this, a later compiler added the nine successive abidings before the four jhānas, forcing the Buddha to descend from saññāvedayitanirodha back through the stages to reach the fourth jhāna.
* This complicated procedure is justified by the Mahānidāna Sutta, which describes a meditator liberated in both ways by traversing the nine abidings in forward and reverse order.

# Tilmann Vetter's Observations

* Vetter also noticed the peculiarity of this account, focusing on the concept of "abandoning" meditative states, which he argues is not from the earliest stratum of Buddhist texts.
* Both the addition of arūpas and the concept of "abandoning" belong to a later period when the original meaning of jhāna was lost.

# Variations in the Parinibbāna Sutta Accounts

* The Roman-script edition of the Samyutta Nikāya from 1884 omits the Buddha's attainment of saññāvedayitanirodha, ending his meditation at the base of neither perception nor non-perception.
* This could be an editorial mistake or represent an intermediary stage in the development of this account.

# The Status of Arūpas and the Original Jhāna System

* The investigation concludes that arūpas were not part of the earliest stratum of Buddhist texts.
* Originally, the four jhānas formed a complete set of meditative stages connected to other important elements of early Buddhist soteriology.

# Returning to the Process of Meditation Leading to Jhāna

* The text shifts focus back to the process of meditation leading to jhāna, contrasting Buddhaghosa's detailed analysis with descriptions found in the suttas. 




## 2.1.3 The Place And Role Of The Ten Kasin.As In The Suttapit.Aka

* The Visuddhimagga emphasizes the ten *kasin.* as for attaining jhāna and considers them suitable for all characters.
* However, descriptions of *kasin.* as are rare in the Suttapit.aka, appearing only in a few suttas like the San. gīti Sutta, Mahāsakuludāyi Sutta, Kasin. a sutta, Kālī sutta, Pat.hamakosala Sutta, and the Ekakanipāta of the An. guttara Nikāya.
* The Suttapit.aka defines *kasin.* as differently from the Visuddhimagga, replacing the consciousness *kasin.* a with light *kasin.* a and limited space *kasin.* a instead of space *kasin.* a.

##  The Role Of Kasina In The Suttas

* The Pat.hamakosala Sutta considers consciousness *kasin.* a as the best among the ten.
* The Pañcattaya Sutta mentions consciousness *kasin.* a as a view held by eternalists.
* The Ekakanipāta suttas describe someone perceiving the ten *kasin.* as as having jhāna, but this connection seems mechanical and applied to various Buddhist factors unrelated to jhāna.

##  Further Analysis Of Kasina In Suttas

* The Kālī Sutta interprets a Buddha statement about jhāna through the lens of *kasin.* a mastery, but its authenticity is questionable.
* The Mahārāhulovāda Sutta advises meditation in tune with elements as metaphors for positive mental qualities, not *kasin.* a meditation.

* The Kakacūpama Sutta uses earth and empty space as metaphors for an unaffected mind when facing improper address.
* Apart from these cases, there are no other suttas explicitly discussing *kasin.* a meditation.


##  Comparison With Visuddhimagga

* The Visuddhimagga emphasizes perception (*saññā*) of elements and colors in *kasin.* a meditation.
* However, the Sandha Sutta condemns perceiving basic qualities as jhāna, contradicting the Visuddhimagga's approach.
* The Suttapit.aka seems largely unaware of *kasin.* a meditation, with some suttas even condemning it, which contrasts sharply with its importance in the Visuddhimagga.

## 2.1.4 The Concept Of Nimitta In The Suttapit.Aka

* The term *nimitta* appears frequently in the suttas and its meaning varies depending on context.

* Sometimes, *nimitta* refers to a dominant feature of an object that allows us to identify it, overshadowing other details.
* This usage is seen in the stock formula for sense restraint (Sāmaññaphala Scheme) where one avoids grasping at the signs (*nimittas*) of objects with the senses.

* *Nimitta* can also refer to abstract qualities like beauty or repulsiveness, as seen in the Āhāra Sutta (SN 46.51).
* Grasping these *nimittas* is presented as potentially dangerous.

* In the Nimitta Sutta (AN 3.100/i.255), *nimitta* refers to signs of concentration, exertion, and equanimity.
* Attending to only one sign can lead to imbalances in meditation.

* The San. gīti Sutta (DN 33) distinguishes between the *nimitta* of serenity and the *nimitta* of exertion, representing opposite qualities that need to be balanced for progress.

* The Kāya Sutta (SN 46.2) mentions the *nimitta* of *samatha* (tranquility) and *abyagga* (non-dispersal), suggesting *nimitta* can refer to mental qualities.

* In the Vitakkasan.t.hāna Sutta (MN 20), *nimittas* are presented as methods for quieting the mind, including shifting attention from one sign to another when needed.
* This usage is closer to the Visuddhimagga's meaning but not identical.

* The Bhikkhunūpassaya Sutta (SN 47.10) describes using inspiring *nimittas* as a temporary measure during meditation to overcome difficulties.
* Unlike the Visuddhimagga, this sutta emphasizes returning to the main form of meditation after using *nimitta*.

* Tse-Fu Kuan argues that the Sūda Sutta (SN 47.8) uses *nimitta* in the same way as the Visuddhimagga, referring to grasping the mental sign (*saññā*) formed during meditation.
* However, this interpretation ignores the simile used in the sutta, which compares a cook who fails to grasp his master's preferences to a meditator who doesn't grasp the *nimitta*.




# Grasping the Nimitta

* The simile used in the Sūda Sutta suggests that grasping *nimitta* refers to becoming aware of the mind's state rather than forming a counterpart sign.
* Recognizing the mind's condition (over-aroused, sluggish, distracted etc.) allows the meditator to choose appropriate meditation techniques to counter any defilements present.

# The Son. a Sutta

* This sutta compares meditation to playing a *vīn.* ā, highlighting the importance of finding the right balance in effort.
* Over-exertion leads to restlessness while slackness results in laziness.
* "Grasping the sign" refers to recognizing the mind's state and adjusting practice accordingly.

# The Upakkilesa Sutta and Counterpart Sign

* Kuan interprets the "light and forms" experienced by Anuruddha as a counterpart sign, but this interpretation is problematic.
* The sutta presents light and forms as side effects of concentration rather than the object of meditation itself.
* Unlike counterpart signs, which are single luminous objects, the Upakkilesa Sutta distinguishes between light and forms, describing them differently.

# The Gayāsīsa Sutta

* This sutta offers a similar account to the Upakkilesa Sutta regarding "light and forms."
* It suggests that these phenomena represent knowledge and vision of *devas* rather than counterpart signs.
* The Buddha's attainment of awakening is linked to mastering "eightfold knowledge and vision of higher devas," implying a progression beyond simply perceiving light and forms.

# Alternative Interpretations of Light and Forms

* Some suttas suggest that the mind is inherently luminous, but defilements obscure this natural luminosity.
* Removing these defilements allows the mind's inherent light to shine through.
* This interpretation aligns with the Upakkilesa Sutta, where defilements hinder the perception of light.

# The Absence of Pat.ibhāganimitta in Suttas

* The concept of *pat.ibhāganimitta* (counterpart sign) as described in the Visuddhimagga is not found in the suttas.
* This absence suggests that it was not part of the Buddha's original teachings.




## 2.1.5 The Place And Role Of Vitakka And Vicāra In The Suttapit.Aka

* Vitakka and *vicāra* are frequently mentioned in the Suttapit.aka, but their meaning differs from that presented by Buddhaghosa in the Visuddhimagga.
* While *vitakka* appears more often than *vicāra*, both terms often denote normal, mundane thinking.
* In some cases, *vicāra* stands alone and seems to function independently of *vitakka*.

## Vitakka And Vicāra In Meditation

* Both *vitakka* and *vicāra* are seen as imperfections in meditation.
* The Dutiyanidhāna Sutta describes desire arising from thinking (*vitakka*) and pondering (*vicāra*) about past desires.
* The Vitakkasan.t.hāna Sutta lists five methods for dealing with evil thoughts (*pāpakā akusalā vitakkā*), including leading them to their resting place.
* The Dantabhūmi Sutta advises against thinking thoughts connected with the body while meditating on it.

##  Vitakka And Vicāra In Jhāna

* Early suttas describe jhāna differently than the Visuddhimagga. 
* The first two jhānas are characterized by thought (*savitakkam*) and examination (*savicāram*), suggesting they were not states of pure one-pointedness (*ekaggatā*).
* The Mahāvedalla Sutta, a late sutta, introduces *ekaggatā* as a jhāna factor, indicating a later development in the understanding of jhāna.



# The Conquest of the Nīvaran.*as*

* The Visuddhimagga states that the five *nīvaran.* as must be suppressed by the five positive jhāna factors. 
* This suppression leads to their temporary elimination.
* In the suttas, the abandonment of the *nīvaran.* as is described differently.
* Concentration develops gradually as a reaction to the abandonment of the *nīvaran.* as.

# From Jhāna To Yoga

* The theory of meditation presented in the Visuddhimagga differs from the earliest stratum of the Suttapit.aka. 
* Concepts like uggahanimitta, pat.ibhāganimitta, ten kasin. as, and arūpas are absent or not described as objects of meditation in the suttas.
* The suttas do not mention upacāra *samādhi*, a crucial transitional stage of concentration in the Visuddhimagga.

* The four jhānas were likely not originally considered yogic meditation.

* Over time, the jhānas came to be seen as a form of yogic meditation, leading to interpretative challenges.

* Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga attempted to address these challenges by introducing new concepts like upacāra *samādhi*, nimittas, and a technical understanding of vitakka and vicāra.




# The Development of Kasina Meditation

* The interpretation of nothingness as a 'perception of nothingness' may be a later development.
* The position of *saññāvedayitanirodha*, the last stage of the nine successive abidings and eight liberations, was probably not fixed for some time.
* The Pot.t.hapāda Sutta gets into trouble when it attempts to describe this stage of 'cessation'.

# The Connection Between Jhanas and Arūpas

* The set of the eight liberations can be seen as containing the final configuration of the arūpas.
* *Saññāvedayitanirodha* is preceded in this set by the four *arūpas*, and the three preliminary stages.
* When the four jhānas started to be seen as yogic type of meditation, this caused some interpretative problems for the later generations of Buddhists.

# The Eight Liberations and the Kasinas

* The first three liberations correspond to the four jhānas.
* These vague sentences can be seen as the descriptions of the process of meditation presented in the Visuddhimagga.
* The set of eight masteries could have provided the rationale for interpreting the ten kasin. *āyatānas* as the meditative objects.

# The Kasinas in the Patisambhidāmagga

* In one set, we find the list of the ten *kasin.* as known from the suttas.
* But they are not presented as the meditative devices.
* The second set distinguishes only eight *kasin.* as.


# Understanding Discrepancies in Kasina Theory

* Now we can finally understand the discrepancies between the canonic set of kasin. as, and the one given in the Visuddhimagga.
* We can also understand some supposedly unclear statements about the *kasin.* as given in the suttas.
* The ten *kasin.* as were originally not meant to be meditative devices.

# Vetter's Perspective on Kasina Development

* Tilmann Vetter has also emphasized the fact that the ten kasin. *āyatānas* do not belong to the earliest stratum.
* According to Vetter, the original jhāna meditation had nothing to do with the *arūpas* and the kasin. as.
* Some later Buddhists were not satisfied with the idea that insight happens in a purely theoretical way, and wanted to put more emphasis on the meditative practices.

# The Development of Meditation Theory

* Later Buddhists based their meditation theory on suttas, seeking minimal supporting evidence for concepts.
* They believed the Buddha taught this form of meditation and searched for relevant fragments in the suttas.
* Sets like the eight liberations, masteries, and ten kasin *āyatānas* were crucial as they provided justification for understanding jhāna as 'Buddhist yoga'.

# The Visuddhimagga and its Innovations

* The Visuddhimagga presents a culmination of meditation theory development.
* It contains innovations like complex nimitta theory, upacāra samādhi concept, technical understanding of vitakka and vicāra, and a sophisticated cognitive process doctrine.
* These innovations likely stemmed from lost Syngalese commentaries rather than Buddhaghosa's independent thinking.

# Reinterpretation and Distortions

* A fundamental reinterpretation of jhāna occurred before Buddhaghosa.
* He aimed to synthesize existing pieces into a coherent theory, succeeding in this but not aligning with early suttas' views on meditation.
* Some Western Buddhists blame Buddhaghosa for distorting the Buddha's message, but the crucial modifications predate him.

# Analyzing Jhāna in the Visuddhimagga

* The original meaning of jhāna was lost before Buddhaghosa.
* His scheme relies on yogic sets like the eight liberations, originally unrelated to jhāna.
* Buddhaghosa focuses heavily on pre-jhāna processes but provides little detail about the four jhānas themselves.
* He enumerates jhāna factors gained and dropped but struggles with their analysis.

# The Problem of Vitakka and Vicāra

* Buddhaghosa's system requires vitakka and vicāra for attaining arūpas, despite them being absent in higher jhānas according to suttas.
* He resolves this through the concept of "meditative reviewing," where meditators briefly emerge from jhāna to review it using vitakka and vicāra before proceeding.

# Practicality and Hindu Yogins

* The "reviewing" concept lacks practicality, as deep absorption in meditation wouldn't allow for conscious interruption.
* It also contradicts the progress made in meditation, suggesting a theoretical rather than practical approach.
* Hindu yogins, masters of practical meditation, are unaware of this "reviewing" concept.




## 2.2.2 Ānāpānasati Meditation

* The Visuddhimagga provides a detailed description of *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) meditation.
* Buddhaghosa outlines several stages, starting with counting breaths to settle mindfulness on in-breaths and out-breaths.
* Counting should be slow initially, becoming faster as concentration develops.

* The meditator should focus on one point touched by the breath, like the tip of the nose.
* As practice progresses, the breath becomes subtler and harder to grasp.

* Buddhaghosa emphasizes that *ānāpānasati* is challenging but rewarding, leading to the suppression of hindrances (*nīvaran. as*) and the appearance of a *nimitta*.
* The *nimitta* can manifest in various forms.

* Ānāpānasati occupies a prominent place in the Suttapit.aka with dedicated suttas like the Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118) and those in the Ānāpānasam. yutta (SN 54).
* The basic form of *ānāpānasati* involves noting long or short breaths, both inhaling and exhaling.

* This basic version differs from the Visuddhimagga's account, lacking mention of breath *nimittas*, counting, or focusing on a specific point.

* Suttas like Satipat.t.hāna Sutta analyze *ānāpānasati* in terms of the four *satipat.t.hāna*s (body, feeling, mind, and phenomena).
* Later commentarial insertions in some suttas suggest experiencing the "whole body [of breath]" while breathing.

* The Kāmbahu Sutta (SN 41.6) identifies in-breaths and out-breaths as bodily formations (*sam. *khāras*), connected to the body.
* This, combined with the Ariyavāsa Sutta's (AN 10.20/v.30) mention of tranquilizing bodily formations in the fourth jhāna, led to the interpretation that breathing ceases in this state.

# The Evolution of Ānāpānasati

* The basic *ānāpānasati* formula focuses on awareness of breathing but doesn't specify fixating on a single point.
* Early Buddhism understood "body" (*kāya*) and "formations" (*sam. khāras*) differently than later interpretations.
* *Kāya* encompassed all six senses, including the mind, while *sam. khāras* referred to volitional conditioned activities rather than mere bodily movements.

#  Ānāpānasati as an Alternative Description of Jhāna Meditation

* Elements like rapture (*pīti*), pleasure (*sukha*), and calming the mind (*samādaham. cittam*) found in *ānāpānasati* are also present in jhāna descriptions.
* Releasing the mind while breathing aligns with the liberation of the mind (*cetovimutti*) in the fourth jhāna.

#  Reasons for Reinterpreting Ānāpānasati

* The basic form of *ānāpānasati* didn't fit the yogic model of meditation, lacking a fixed object and broad awareness incompatible with single-pointed focus.
* Later elaborations aimed to address these issues by interpreting breath as the "body among bodies" and focusing on a single point.

#  Interpretations of "Entire Body" and "Tranquilizing Formations"

* The Theravādins modified "experiencing the entire body" to "experiencing the entire body [of breath]," while Sarvāstivādins suggested breathing through pores throughout the body.
* Tranquilizing formations was reinterpreted as stopping the breath, aligning with yogic practices.

#  Visuddhimagga's Modifications and Influences

* Buddhaghosa advocated restricting awareness to a single point during *ānāpānasati*.
* The concept of breath-*nimitta* (sign) appearing in various forms may be influenced by similar descriptions in the Śvetāśvatara Upanis.ad, suggesting shared yogic practices.

#  The Original Meaning of Ānāpānasati

* *Ānāpānasati* was not intended as a yogic meditation but its original meaning was lost over time.
* The constant presence of breathing descriptions throughout the practice suggests a broader purpose beyond exclusive fixation on breath.

# Wouldn't these descriptions of breathing become redundant?

* The Buddha embraced the connection between breath and mind discovered by yogis but took a different approach.
* He aimed for a pliable mind through spontaneous, unforced breathing rather than cessation of breath.
* This contrasted with the prevalent yogic belief that breathing should cease in advanced meditation.

# 2.2.3 The Attainment Of Cessation

* *Saññāvedayitanirodha*, also known as attainment of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti), involves stopping perception and feeling, leading to complete mental stillness.
* It's the most difficult meditative state, achievable only by Arahants and Non-Returners who have mastered both jhānas and *arūpas*.
* Requires full development of both *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassanā* (insight).

* Attainment involves progressing through jhānas, contemplating their impermanence, suffering, and lack of self.
* After the base of nothingness, a 'fourfold preparatory task' is performed:
    * Safeguarding possessions from damage.
    * Availability to the monastic community and Buddha.
    * Ensuring lifespan for at least seven days.

* Consciousness halts completely during cessation, lasting as predetermined.
* Upon emergence, 'fruit-consciousness' arises, with Nibbāna as its object.
* Cessation is a state of complete inactivity, even bodily functions cease.

* The Kambahu Sutta recounts a story where Sañjiva attained cessation and was mistakenly cremated but emerged unharmed.
* Buddhaghosa considers *nirodhasamāpatti* a type of Nibbāna due to its resemblance to the final Nibbāna of an Arahant after death.

# The Influence of Yogic Meditation on Buddhism

* *Saññāvedayitanirodha* embodies yogic meditation principles: breath restraint, sensory inactivity, and mind cessation.
* Hindu scriptures also describe a similar state where yogis become invincible, free from death and external influences.




## # Were The Four Jhānas Practiced By The Non-Buddhists?

* This section explores whether the four jhānas were unique to Buddhism or practiced by non-Buddhists.
* It discusses the Khaggavisān. a Sutta, which mentions the fourth jhāna and is traditionally attributed to Pacceka Buddhas (predecessors of Buddha).
* Bronkhorst argues that this sutta is later than Buddha Sakyamuni's time, implying the jhānas were practiced before him.

## # The Brahmajāla Sutta and its Authenticity

* This section examines the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN 1), which describes non-Buddhists practicing the four jhānas but misinterpreting them as "Nibbāna here and now."
* It raises doubts about the sutta's authenticity due to its depiction of sixty-two wrong views held by non-Buddhists, explained through unusual interpretations of supernatural knowledge.

## # Explanations of Wrong Views in Brahmajāla Sutta

* The sutta explains the origin of various metaphysical views (eternalism, annihilationism, skepticism) as arising from misinterpretations of experiences gained through supernatural powers (*iddhis*).
* It provides explanations for the belief in *brahman*, finite and infinite worlds, chance origination, and different forms of annihilationism.

## # Critique of Brahmajāla Sutta's Explanations

* The section criticizes the sutta's explanations as lacking resemblance to the actual historical development of these philosophical views.
* It cites examples like the explanation for the concept of *brahman*, which contradicts the understanding found in Upanishads.




# The Brahmajāla Sutta and its Problems

- The sutta presents sixty-two wrong views attributed to non-Buddhists, but these views seem fictional and don't align with actual historical doctrines.
- The sutta's description of skepticism is inaccurate and likely a slander against the skeptic movement led by Sañjaya Belat.t.hiputta.

# The Sāmaññaphala Sutta as a Source

- This sutta offers a more reliable account of non-Buddhist doctrines, including those of Pūran. a Kassapa, Ajita Kesakambalī, Pakudha Kaccayāna, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigan. t.ha Nātaputta (Jina Mahāvīra), and Sañjaya Belat.t.hiputta.
- These doctrines are unique and don't fit the simplistic schemes presented in the Brahmajāla Sutta.

# Dating and Authenticity of the Brahmajāla Sutta

- The sutta's content, style, and ending suggest it may be a later composition rather than an authentic representation of early Buddhist thought.
- The self-reference and supernatural effects resemble features found in Mahāyāna sutras.

# Internal Buddhist Polemic on Jhānas

- The Brahmajāla Sutta criticizes some individuals for considering the four jhānas as "Nibbāna here and now," which ironically seems to reflect early Buddhist practices.
- This suggests an internal debate within Buddhism regarding the status of jhānas, possibly stemming from conflicting views between jhāna practitioners and those focused on understanding (dhammayogins).

# Evolution of Jhāna Concepts

- The Jhāna Sutta (AN 4.123) portrays jhānas leading to rebirth in deva realms, contrasting with the orthodox Theravāda view of jhānas leading to liberation.
- This earlier sutta likely represents a transitional stage in the development of Buddhist thought on jhānas and their connection to different stages of liberation.

# Jhānas and Arūpas

- The association of jhānas with specific celestial realms facilitated their integration with the four arūpas, which were already linked to such realms.
- This cosmological framework provided a unifying principle for the set of meditative attainments.




# The Origin of Jhāna Meditation

* According to some suttas like Sandha Sutta, Dhammapada, and Kat.t.hahāra Sutta, deities envy meditators who practice jhāna because they cannot comprehend this state.
* The Brahmajāla Sutta and Jhāna Sutta are the only two suttas in Suttapit.aka that attribute the practice of four jhānas to non-Buddhists. However, these suttas are considered inauthentic.

# Evidence for the Unique Buddhist Origin of Jhāna

* The 'bodhisatta suttas' suggest that the four jhānas were originally a meditative practice unique to Buddhism and likely discovered by the Buddha himself.
* Hindu meditative texts do not describe anything like the four Buddhist jhānas.
* Texts explicitly state that the Buddha was the one who discovered jhāna, as seen in the Māradhītu Sutta and Pañcālacan. d. a Sutta.

# Jhāna as Central to Buddhist Practice

* In Subha Sutta, a Brahmin named Subha acknowledges that the four jhānas are unique to Buddhists and central to their practice.
* The Uppāda Sutta defines *samādhindriya* simply as the four jhānas.
* The Dasuttara Sutta describes 'the fivefold knowledge of right concentration' (pañca ñān. *iko sammāsamādhi*) which is always defined as the four jhānas and highlights their exclusive nature to Buddhism.

# Implications of Jhāna Belonging to Non-Buddhists

* If jhānas were practiced by non-Buddhists, they would inevitably attain Nibbāna according to Jhāna Sam. yutta.
* Suttas in An. guttara Nikāya describe each jhāna as leading to Nibbāna, implying that non-Buddhist practitioners would also experience this liberation.
* The Sāmaññaphala Scheme suggests that attaining the fourth jhāna leads to eradicating *āsavas*, which should apply to all practitioners regardless of their background.

# Jhāna and Yoga

* Some argue that jhānas are a yogic practice, but this contradicts the Buddha's teachings on meditation.
* The Buddha's instructions on breath awareness and lack of emphasis on dietary restrictions or breath retention contradict typical yogic practices.
* Practicing meditation after eating, as advised by the Buddha, is considered a cardinal sin in yoga.

# Reconciling Textual Analysis with Tradition

* While textual analysis suggests jhānas are unique to Buddhism, this contradicts the Theravāda tradition's view.
* Mircea Eliade argues that it is unlikely for such a rich meditative corpus to be lost or mutilated within a tradition emphasizing direct teaching.
* Chögyam Trungpa praises the unbroken lineage of transmission in the Theravāda tradition.





## 2.3 Uncovering The Inconvenient Truth: A Look On The Meditative Tradition Of Theravāda Buddhism

* There are two main branches within the modern Theravāda tradition of meditation: the Burmese vipassanā tradition, and the Thai kammat.t.hāna tradition.

* The kammat.t.hāna tradition is characterized by renowned masters such as Ajaan Chah, Ajaan Lee, Ajaan Thate, Ajaan Fuang, and Ajaan Maha Boowa.
* These masters were all disciples of Ajaan Mun, who was a charismatic leader but did not write any books or give many recorded talks.

* Ajaan Sao influenced Ajaan Mun in discipline and meditative exercises.
* Both Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Sao are considered to be the founders of the kammat.t.hāna lineage as they had no teachers of meditation themselves.

* The vipassanā tradition is more diverse than the kammat.t.hāna movement, with some masters developing their own methods from scratch.
* Sunlun Sayadaw, a famous master, developed his unique method without any teacher.

* Ledi Sayadaw, an early representative of the vipassanā tradition, was a learned monk who wrote extensively but provided little information about his own meditative practices or teachers.

* Mahasi Sayadaw, another influential figure, was a disciple of Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw, who also had to seek guidance from Aletawya Sayadaw.
* The-Lon Sayadaw, the teacher of Aletawya Sayadaw, appears to have been a self-taught meditator.

* Both the kammat.t.hāna and vipassanā traditions lack clear evidence of unbroken lineages going back to the Buddha.

# The Origins of Modern Theravāda Meditation Traditions

* Nineteenth-century monks like Ledi Sayadaw and The-Lon Sayadaw developed meditation practices based on textual guidance without personal teachers.
* These lineages led many practitioners to achieve significant levels of liberation from suffering, according to their own reports.

# Ledi Sayadaw's Method

* Ledi Sayadaw was a brilliant Abhidhammic scholar and reformer of Burmese Buddhism.
* He emphasized gaining insight knowledge through understanding impermanence, illustrated by the simile of a cinematographic show.
* His instruction on meditation was general and theoretical, focusing on realizing impermanence and non-self.

# The Development of Vipassanā Meditation

* Ledi Sayadaw's method served as a launchpad for various forms of vipassanā meditation.
* Mahasi Sayadaw emphasized noting changing phenomena, Sunlun Sayadaw advocated bare awareness of sensations, and U Ba Khin developed the "sweeping" technique.
* Ledi Sayadaw encouraged lay followers to engage in vipassanā practice, contributing to its worldwide success.

# The Sri Lankan Context

* The Sri Lankan branch of Theravāda Buddhism almost died out in the nineteenth century.
* Westerners, particularly Theosophists like Olcott and Blavatsky, played a significant role in its revival.
* No modern meditation tradition originated in Sri Lanka.

# A Surprising Conclusion

* Modern traditions of Theravāda meditation originated not long before the twentieth century.
* There is little mention of proper meditative practices within the Theravāda camp in the nineteenth century.
* This challenges popular beliefs about Buddhism's unbroken lineage of meditation.

# The Reality of Meditation Practice

* According to Jack Kornfield, a small percentage of monks meditate.
* Bhikkhu Sujato recounts an anecdote highlighting the lack of familiarity with core Buddhist texts among some monks.
* Gregory Schopen's research suggests ancient monks were active in social activities rather than solely focused on meditation.

# The Character of Modern Theravāda Meditation Teachings

* Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Sao, seminal figures of the kammat.t.hāna movement, emphasized simple repetition of the word "Buddho" as a meditative practice.
* This method was also taught by other prominent teachers like Ajaan Chah, Ajaan Thate, Ajaan Maha Boowa, and Ajaan Lee.

# Non-Buddhist Elements

* The use of mantras like "Buddho" suggests possible non-Buddhist influences on modern Theravāda meditation practices.

# Buddho Mantra and Yogic Meditation

* 'Buddho' is a mantra like OM, indicating a yogic practice rather than original Buddhist jhāna.
* The meditation on 'Buddho' isn't found in Pali Canon suttas or Buddhaghosa's writings.
* Visuddhimagga describes recollection of the Buddha through contemplation of his qualities, leading to *upacāra samādhi*.

# Ajaan Lee's Meditation Method

* Combines breathing meditation, 'Buddho' repetition, and visualizations.
* Involves counting breaths with mantra, then dropping the counting and mantra, focusing on breath aspects.
* Utilizes five "bases" of breath located in different body parts, visualized and explored.

# Nimittas and Energy Centers

* *Nimittas*, mental images or sensations, arise during practice.
* Meditator focuses on a *nimitta*, expands it, and moves it to the fifth base (chest).
* Pure breath fills the chest and spreads throughout the body, leading to visualizations of body parts.
* This method resembles tantric and hatha-yogic practices involving mantras, visualizations, and breath retention in specific body regions.

# Ajahn Brahm's Jhāna

* Emphasizes jhāna as superior to sensory experiences.
* Describes jhāna as a state of complete sensory shutdown, where even physical sensations are absent.
* Relates an anecdote about a disciple entering jhāna so deeply that he was mistaken for dead and revived by defibrillators without feeling anything.

# Sunlun Sayadaw's Vipassanā Method

* Involves forceful, rapid breathing to control the mind and ward off distractions.
* Focus on breath sensation at the upper lip or nose tip.
* Encourages perseverance through pain and discomfort arising from the practice.
* Emphasizes facing reality directly through bodily sensations.

# Comparison with Early Buddhism

* Sunlun's method, with its emphasis on pain and discomfort, resembles practices rejected by the bodhisatta for being overly arousing.
* Buddha advocated reaching pleasure through pleasure (jhāna), not hardship.
* Modern Theravāda meditation traditions deviate from early Buddhist teachings, incorporating elements criticized in the Suttapitaka.

# Conclusion

* Modern Theravāda meditation lineages don't appear to preserve the Buddha's original meditative teachings.
* Both Visuddhimagga and contemporary practices diverge from early Buddhism.

## 2.3.3 The Meditative Practices In The Yogāvacara Manual

* The Yogāvacara Manual, discovered in 1893, is a later work than the Visuddhimagga and contains new developments in meditative practices.
* It describes developing 112 positive Buddhist qualities in ten groups through a single meditation session using a similar method for each quality.
* This approach differs from traditional Buddhist teachings found in the Suttapitaka and Visuddhimagga.

##  The Yogāvacara Manual's Method

* The basic method involves focusing on five kinds of rapture (*pīti*) while visualizing the tip of one's nose.
* This leads to the appearance of hazy and clear images, symbolizing the purification process.
* Elements like fire, earth, water, space, and wind are visualized with specific colors and forms.

## Analysis of the Yogāvacara Manual

* The meditation described in the manual deviates significantly from early Buddhist practices.
* It incorporates elements from yoga but is heavily influenced by tantric traditions.
* This suggests that Buddhism was receptive to external meditative influences throughout its history.


## Conclusion

* Early Buddhism likely did not preserve its original meditative form.
* Influences from yoga and tantrism shaped Buddhist meditation over time, as seen in the Visuddhimagga, Yogāvacara Manual, and modern Theravadin teachings.

## 2.3.4 The Buddhist Myth Of Decline

*  The Theravāda Buddhists likely weren't practicing meditation for most of the nineteenth century. This changed with charismatic figures like Ledi Sayadaw, Ajaan Sao, Ajaan Mun, and Sunlun Sayadaw.
* There are reasons to believe this meditative slumber lasted centuries. The Buddhists' refusal to practice meditation was justified by their knowledge of scriptures.

* The Gotamī Sutta (AN 8.51/iv.277) states that the Buddha initially refused to allow women to become nuns, believing it would shorten the lifespan of the Dhamma.
* Modern Buddhists tend to ignore this passage. Ancient Buddhists accepted it as truth, believing the Dhamma would only last 500 years due to women's inclusion in monastic life.

* This acceptance was connected to a prevalent idea: the myth of 'golden beginnings'. This myth posits that mankind's golden age has passed and we live in a decadent era.
* The Cakkavati-Sihānada Sutta (DN 26) states Buddha Sakyamuni was the last Buddha of the decline, with morality worsening until humans live only ten years.

*  Ancient Buddhists believed they lived in an era of great decline, making the road to liberation impossible. Attainment of Arahantship was considered unattainable.
* The hagiographic work Budddhaghosuppatti suggests even Buddhaghosa, a revered figure, wasn't considered an Arahant and would be reborn as a disciple of the future Buddha Metteyya.

* This belief in a closed path to Nibbāna explains why meditation was abandoned. Some aspects of Visuddhimagga's theory of meditation appear purely theoretical and impractical.
* The treatise may have been a tribute to heroic times when Arahants walked the earth, rather than a practical manual. Buddhaghosa himself likely didn't achieve the lofty states described in his work.

* Even later figures like Prince Mongkut accepted that reaching Arahantship was impossible. Many aimed for bodhisatta vows and future Buddhahood.
* Ledi Sayadaw wasn't considered an Arahant, but an *anāgāmi*. Declarations of Arahantship by Ajaan Mun and Sunlun Sayadaw were shocking as they challenged this belief.

* The original practice of jhāna was lost due to several factors: Buddhism's minor status in India before Aśoka, uncertainty about the Buddha's teachings, and yogic meditation's wider popularity.
* Yogic meditation was more comprehensible and aligned with the idea that suffering stems from activity. Buddhist jhāna was elusive and paradoxical, even for devas according to the Sandha Sutta.

* The influence of Buddhism on yogic meditation was limited to terminology. The Buddha innovated in this regard, using existing terms with new meanings.
* This led to interpretative problems for later Buddhists, addressed by Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga. However, it couldn't perfectly conform to the old suttas.

* Reinterpreting jhāna as yoga created practical problems. Buddhists lacked knowledge of crucial yogic elements like prānāyāma, kumbhaka, bandhas, diet, āsanas, and mantras.
* Without these, Buddhist yoga was destined to fail. Buddhists accepted this failure, justifying it through historiosophy and the Gotamī Sutta, leading to a thousand-year hiatus in meditation practice.





# Perspectives

* The orthodox vision of jhāna as a yogic type of meditation is completely wrong. 
* Jhāna was not yoga, but seen in early Buddhism as the direct opposite of yogic meditation.
* Jhāna was a central element of early Buddhist soteriology.

* There are many different concepts of liberating insight in the Suttapit.aka which appear to be very difficult to reconcile.

* The conflict focuses on the nature of jhāna: in some suttas, the fourth jhāna is a perfect state allowing liberating insight; in others, jhāna is imperfect and these imperfections are the object of insight.
* Ancient Buddhists dealt with this issue by developing a concept of insight into the imperfections of jhāna, and by introducing a concept of *lokuttara* jhāna.

* The concept of *samathayānika* (vehicle of serenity) is problematic because it involves analyzing a past state (jhāna), which means working with memory and not the present.
* Another problematic view is that one can suddenly stop *samatha* meditation in a jhāna and start insight practice while still in that state, making the jhāna and its imperfection the object of insight.

* Serious difficulties are also connected with the traditional Buddhist concept of insight as active contemplation; applying categories; understanding it in terms of 'impermanence', 'suffering', 'non self'; classifying it under the headings of different *khandhas*.
* Liberating insight was not seen as some sort of deliberately undertaken activity or as a form of conscious, active thinking.

* In the earliest stratum of the Suttapit.aka, liberating knowledge was dominantly understood not in a sense of an 'activity' which liberates one from suffering, but rather in a sense of a certainty of the fact of one's own liberation.
* One gets the feeling that in the earliest suttas we are dealing with 'the knowledge of liberation' and not with 'the liberating knowledge'.

* Mindfulness (*sati*) occupies a central place in Buddhist soteriology. 
* The traditional view is that we can be 'positively mindful', 'aware' of our own state, as it really is 'here and now'.

* We cannot be in fact 'positively mindful' of our experience 'here and now'. Our real life is in fact completely ungraspable to us in such a way.
* Mindfulness can be seen as functioning in two ways: In one way, mindfulness is a guard working in a negative way. It may not be positively aware of the 'here and now' but may be aware of every our attempt that takes us away from the 'here and now'.

# Early Buddhism and the Body

* Early Buddhism developed a unique vision of the body and mind.
* The *kāyagatāsati* formula emphasizes mindfulness of the six-fold body (five senses plus mind/intellect).
* This concept suggests that the mind is not fundamentally different from the other senses.

# Mind in Early Buddhism

* Early Buddhists did not view mind as a container for mental contents or a field of consciousness.
* Thoughts and emotions were considered bodily states, not mental ideas.
* The term 'mind' (*citta*) was used functionally, describing states like 'deluded mind' or 'liberating the mind'.
*  Early Buddhism rejected the notion of a 'stream of consciousness' or 'field of consciousness'.

# Satipatthana and Mindfulness

* The *satipat.t.hāna* formula outlines four different aspects of mindfulness practice, all related to the six-fold body.
* *Kāyagatāsati* is not limited to bodily sensations but encompasses awareness of all six senses, including thoughts and emotions.
* Practices like dissecting movements into fleeting sensations are considered artificial and contrary to early Buddhist teachings.

# Three Doctrines: Later Developments?

* The four noble truths, dependent co-arising, and the five *khandhas* are often presented as central to early Buddhism.
* However, scholars suggest these concepts may be later developments.
* Some suttas indicate that these doctrines were seen as preliminary insights and not sufficient for attaining liberation.
* These theories have limited explanatory power regarding the causes of ignorance and self-view.

## The Role of Saññā in Early Buddhist Thought

- **The Nature and Function of Saññā:**
    * *Saññā* (ideation/labeling/perceiving as) plays a crucial role in the arising of ignorance and self-views.
    * It simplifies our experience by grasping the main feature (*nimitta*) of an object while ignoring less obvious features.
    * *Saññā* allows us to classify, label, compare objects, but its categories are not fixed and can be modified.

- **Saññā, Language, and Reality:**
    * Early Buddhism avoids labeling itself as 'realist' or 'idealist'.
    * It distinguishes stages of cognitive process: bare sensations (*vedanā*), perceptions (*saññā*), thoughts (*vitakka*), construing activities (sam. *khāra*), proliferations (*papañca*).
    * Language and *saññā* are interdependent, with language reflecting and shaping our categories of perception.

- **Saññā and the Rejection of Metaphysics:**
    * Early Buddhism rejects metaphysics as seeking 'real' correlates for language terms that should be understood functionally.
    * Dhamma is a tool for liberation, not ultimate truth; it is conveyed through language based on *saññā*.

- **The Arising of Self-View:**
    * A 'deep rooted sense of ego' is not fundamental but arises from the interaction between *saññā*, language, and the pronoun 'I'.
    * Language influences *saññā*, leading us to perceive the world in terms of self.

- **Insight and the Role of Vedānā:**
    * Seeing khandhas/āyatanas/vedanās/*dhātu*s as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and devoid of self leads to dispassion (*virāgā*), disenchantment (*nibbidā*), and liberation (*vimutti*).

- **Beyond Saññā: The Path to Liberation:**
    * *Saññā* is not meant to reflect reality but is a tool for functioning in the world.
    * True insight requires bypassing *saññā* and reaching bare sensations (*vedanā*) uninterpreted by preconceptions.

- **Jhāna, Saññā, and Liberation:**
    * Jhāna is a state where *saññā* ceases but *vedanā* remains, leading to liberation.
    * Alternative descriptions of jhāna emphasize the cognitive aspect: 'ājānīya jhāna', animitta samādhi, appan. *ihita samādhi*, and suññata *samādhi*.



# The Nature of Jhāna

* Jhāna involves the cessation of *saññā* (perception) which leads to a state devoid of self (*suññata samādhi*).
* This view is supported by analyzing the relationship between *abhiññā* (direct knowledge), jhānas, and sense restraint.
* Some suttas suggest *saññā* ceases only in *nirodha*, while others indicate its cessation in jhāna.

# The Buddha's Teaching Style

* The Buddha used alternative formulas to describe the same state or process, without explicitly explaining their relationships.
* Examples include: mindfulness directed to the body (*kāyagatāsati*), sense restraint, development of faculties, and four bases of power (*iddhipāda*) as descriptions of the same process.
* The *satipat.t.hāna*s are theoretical elaborations rather than instructions for practice.

# Understanding Khandhas, Āyatana, and Dhātu

* These concepts were likely theoretical elaborations of a simpler formula describing the individual as 'the body (*kāya*)'.
* Seeing any element of the body as self leads to the arising of self-view.
* Only a concentrated person can see the body as it really is.
* Seeing the body as it truly is leads to dispassion, disenchantment, and liberation.

# Misunderstanding Insight Practices

* The concept of theoretical insight arose from misunderstanding jhāna as yoga.
* Later Buddhists sought methods for insight and misinterpreted these formulas as instructions for practice.

# The End of the World

* Fragments stating the cessation of 'world', feelings, senses, etc., are not in conflict with those suggesting *saññā*, thoughts, and desires cease while senses and feelings remain.
* These fragments should not be interpreted literally but understood within the context of language and perception.
* Concepts like 'world' and 'reality' belong to the realm of *saññā* and cannot be used to describe the state beyond perception.

# Jhāna Descriptions

* Descriptions of jhānas are not depictions of a liberated person's internal state, as this is impossible to conceptualize.
* These descriptions represent the bodily state of the meditator from an external perspective.

# The Buddha's Use of Language

* The Buddha avoided describing jhānas (meditative states) in terms of personal experience to prevent misuse of language. 
* Early Buddhism lacked concepts like "mind" as a container of thoughts, making descriptions of mental contents problematic.
* This approach may also apply to the *brahamavihāras* (divine abodes), suggesting they were not separate practices but alternative descriptions of jhānas.

# The Nature of Liberation

* Misinterpretations exist regarding liberation and the "unestablishment" of consciousness.
* Consciousness is only meaningful in relation to *nāma-rūpa* (mental and physical phenomena).
* When *nāma-rūpa* ceases, concepts like consciousness, discernment, and even the tetralemma become inapplicable.

# The Method of Jhāna

* No explicit method for attaining jhāna is provided in the suttas because the description itself contains all necessary information.
* Jhāna was a culmination of Buddhist practices like virtue, sense restraint, mindfulness (*sati*), and self-awareness (*sampajañña*).
* Sitting meditation simply elevates these qualities to a higher level.

# The Four Satipatthanas and Ānāpānasati

* The four *satipatthanas* (foundations of mindfulness) were considered the sole path to liberation in early Buddhism.
* Jhāna, kāyagatāsati (mindfulness of the body), ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing), and *yonisomanasikāra* (reflection on the origin of beings) are complementary descriptions of the same process.

*Ānāpānasati* is crucial because it highlights the importance of breath awareness, which is present throughout meditation.
* Perfect mindfulness involves transcending conscious awareness of breathing, leading to liberating insight.

# But is such a form of meditation possible at all? Have we not come through our textual analysis to something nonsensical? 
* There are two forms of meditation: *samatha*, which leads to altered states of consciousness by focusing on a single subject, and *vipassanā*, which sees the world as it really is.
* According to textual analysis jhāna was supposed to be a state that provides the altered state of consciousness by mere act of seeing the body as it really is.

# An enigmatic formula (AN 4.41/ii.44) describes the fourfold development of right *samādhi* which leads to: pleasant abiding here and now, knowledge and vision, mindfulness and full awareness, and to the release from the *āsavas*.
* This is not a description of four different types of meditation as commonly accepted.
* These are four different but complimentary aspects of the same meditative practice: the four jhānas.

# I will attempt to show that early Buddhist views on *kamma* were somewhat complicated. 
* Contrary to common beliefs, the Buddha could not provide any plausible explanation of liberation in terms of freedom from *kamma*.
* Early Buddhism could not provide a plausible concept of reincarnation.

# One was liberated from death, ageing, and becoming at the moment of awakening, and the issue of afterlife was automatically becoming irrelevant
* This vision was quickly lost. 
* Later Buddhists shifted the moment of ultimate liberation to an after-death period.

# I will focus on the social dimension of early Buddhism, which was somewhat neglected, and has not received enough attention.
* Early Buddhists emphasized that a bhikkhu was devoid of any social identity.
* Social identity was directly incompatible with the state of jhāna. 

# In traditional view, someone who becomes a monk is seen as standing at point zero, as a spiritual '*tabula rasa'*, 'piece of clay', which is then molded by careful following the instructions of the Buddha.
* This view has very little to do with early Buddhist beliefs.
* The decision to reject lay life and become a beggar (bhikkhu) was seen as a fundamental insight in itself.



# Aftermath

* The author questions the right to adopt a critical attitude towards Buddhism in light of recent revisionist trends in academia.
* Revisionism challenges the objectivity of Western scholarship and accuses it of serving hidden agendas, leading some scholars to abandon critical research in favor of an uncritical approach.
* The author traces the roots of this crisis to the decline of the traditional Western model of science, which was based on the pursuit of objective truth and a belief in universal norms.

# The Crisis of Western Normative Science

* Developments in quantum physics challenged the notion of the scientist as an objective observer, suggesting that observation itself influences reality.
* Philosophers like Feyerabend argued against the universality of the Western scientific model, proposing that different ways of knowing are equally valid.
* Postmodern philosophers like Foucault deconstructed the idea of objective truth, revealing it as a tool for power and control.

# The Roots of the Crisis

* Western philosophy's emphasis on critical thinking and questioning has ultimately undermined its own foundations.
* Philosophers like Plato, Kant, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche challenged fundamental assumptions about knowledge, reality, morality, and language.
* This self-critique culminated in a crisis of justification, leaving philosophy unable to define its own field or provide reasons for its inquiries.

# The Impact on Buddhist Studies

* The crisis of Western normative science has impacted other fields, including Buddhist studies.
* Revisionist arguments against critical studies of early Buddhism highlight the problematic nature of the traditional Western paradigm.
* Bhikkhu Sujato offers an alternative perspective, emphasizing the personal and spiritual motivations for studying early Buddhism.

# Examining Our Existence

* We experience a finite life with its joys and sorrows, riddles of identity, sexuality, and ultimately death.
* There is no certainty about what happens after death, but evidence suggests that our existence ends with the body.
* This realization makes our life precious and unique, demanding we make the most of it.

# The Search for Ultimate Solutions

* We are naturally drawn to proposals offering solutions to existential problems.
* If no such solutions exist or are demonstrably false, we should strive to live fully aware of this reality.
* If a potential solution emerges, investigating it becomes a life priority.

# Buddhism as a Possible Solution

* Buddhism stands out as a less dogmatic and scientifically compatible proposal compared to other options.
* Despite some flaws and discrepancies, the possibility of an underlying core free from these issues makes it worthy of investigation.
* A critical study of Buddhism becomes necessary to uncover its true nature.

# The Limitations of Normative Science

* The traditional approach of unengaged, theoretical science is not universally applicable but specific to Christian culture.
* Christianity provided answers to existential questions, allowing for this detached scientific pursuit.

# Greek Philosophy and Its Religious Context

* While appearing similar to later normative science, Greek philosophy was deeply intertwined with religion.
* Philosophers like Pythagoras and Pyrrhon were also religious figures seeking deliverance from suffering.
* Even seemingly secular schools like Epicureanism and Stoicism aimed at a form of salvation.

# The Decline of Normative Science

* The decline of Christianity in the West has weakened the foundation for normative science.
* Its philosophical basis is being questioned, leading to criticism and alternative views like multiculturalism and relativism.

# Implications for Buddhist Studies

* Traditional Western science struggles to justify critical Buddhist studies due to its focus on theoretical detachment.
* Recognizing the pragmatic value of Buddhism in addressing existential concerns can provide a stronger impetus for its study.

# The Crisis of Western Culture

* Religion is not merely private but influences scientific research and culture.
* Western science faces a crisis due to internal difficulties rather than external challenges.
* This crisis hinders the West's ability to adapt to new developments, particularly in neuroscience, genetics, cognitive and evolutionary sciences.

# The Impact of New Scientific Discoveries

* Neuroscience undermines the traditional concept of human nature as a moral agent with free will and a distinct conscious identity.
* Our self is not permanent but fragile and subject to deconstruction.
* Much of our decision-making occurs unconsciously, challenging the notion of free choice.
* Emotions play a decisive role in our lives, making purely rational decisions impossible.

# The Failure of Western Political Ideologies

* Western political systems are based on the idea of rational, free-willed agents making moral choices for common welfare.
* This idea is flawed, leading to destructive aspects like spin doctors, narratives, and demagogy replacing idealistic politics.
* Evolutionary origins of our behavior reveal that much of our innate behavior reflects a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, incompatible with modern society.

# The Need for Rethinking Human Nature

* Civilizational progress was held back by cultural and religious laws based on falsehoods about human nature.
* Accepting truths about human nature is crucial for building a successful future civilization.
* Both conservative and humanist ideologies in the West are unable to accept these truths, hindering progress.


# The Potential of Buddhism

* The East's economic and political awakening presents an opportunity to propose a new global order.
* Buddhism could fill the ideological gap left by the impotence of Western ideologies.
* Eastern passivity has allowed for open pathways while the West is blocked by its history.

# Harmonizing Buddhism with Modern Science

* Buddhist no-self theory aligns well with neuroscientific findings.
* The East, particularly China, is open to large-scale genetic engineering.
* Eastern religions are anthropocentric and accept the idea of attaining godhood through physical transformation.

# Buddhism and the Normative Crisis

* Buddhist pragmatism offers a solution by focusing on the physical consequences of paradigms rather than theoretical incompatibility.

# The Role of Critical Buddhist Studies

* Buddhism needs to actively rethink its place in the world, moving beyond uncritical affirmation or complete rejection of tradition.
* Critical studies can address existential problems and reinterpret doctrines like karma and reincarnation that may be difficult for modern thinkers to accept.
* Reconstructing early Buddhism offers a way out from problematic aspects of later traditions, similar to the Western Reformation.

# Early Buddhism and Reconciliation

* Critical research into the origins of Buddhism may be creative rather than destructive, unlike in Christianity.
* Early Buddhism offers valuable insights for modern Buddhist branches, including Mahāyāna. 
* Similarities exist between early Buddhist views and Mādhyamaka philosophy.

# Theravāda Buddhism: Preservation and Innovation

* Theravāda Buddhists have preserved the Suttapit.aka, enabling reconstruction of early Buddhist teachings.
* While they may not have retained the original jhāna meditation form, they have kept Dhamma alive through practice.
* Representatives of kammat.t.hāna and vipassanā traditions demonstrate that Gotama's message can still be put into practice.

# Critical Study: Significance and Challenges

* Studying early Buddhism is not merely theoretical; it has far-reaching consequences for understanding Buddhist practice.
* Reconstructing the original doctrine is a challenging but fascinating quest due to its unavailability in readily accessible forms.
