# Table Of Contents

* This chapter discusses the two main traditions of meditation in ancient India: Buddhist and non-Buddhist.

# Preface to the second edition 

* The book explores contradictions and inconsistencies within early Buddhist texts to identify potential non-authentic elements.
* It proposes a criterion for identifying foreign intrusions into Buddhist texts based on elements rejected by the Buddha but found in other religious movements of the time.
* This criterion is applied to the topic of meditation, comparing Buddhist practices with those of Jainism and other non-Buddhist groups.

# The Vitakkasanthåna Sutta and its Parallels

* This sutra recommends restraining thought with the mind, coercing and tormenting it.
* Similar language is used to describe the Buddha's futile attempts at liberation before enlightenment, suggesting Jaina practices were adopted by some Buddhists.

# Four States of Meditation

* These states (Infinity of Space, Infinity of Perception, Nothingness, neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation) aim to cease ideations.
* They resemble Jaina practices and are denounced elsewhere in the Buddhist canon.
* The Buddha's rejection of these stages suggests they were not part of earliest Buddhism.

# Time of Liberation

* Some passages claim liberation occurs in this life, others at death.
* This contradiction could be explained by foreign influence, as non-Buddhists believed liberation occurred at death.

# Acknowledgements to the First Edition

* The author thanks the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement of Pure Research (ZWO) and individuals who provided support and assistance.

# Introduction

* The book aims to determine what early Buddhist meditation was by identifying what it wasn't.
* It uses a method of analyzing criticisms of alternative practices found in other religious traditions (Jainism and Hinduism).
* Features unique to Buddhism are considered more likely to be part of earliest Buddhism.




# 1.1. At Three Places6 In The Majjhima Nikåya Of The Påli Buddhist Canon An Episode Is Found In Which The Buddha Describes How He, Before His Enlightenment, Tried Out Two Methods Which He Then Discovered Did Not Lead To The Desired End.

* The two methods are 'Meditation Without Breath' and 'Reduced Intake of Food'.
* The episode is found in the Mahåsaccaka Sutta.
* The Buddha describes his experiences with each method in detail.

# Meditation Without Breath

* The Buddha tried stopping his breath through his mouth, nose, and ears.
* This resulted in various unpleasant sensations, including strong noises in his ears, shaking of his head, headaches, and a burning sensation throughout his body.
* Despite the discomfort, the Buddha's energy remained aroused and his mindfulness alert.

# Reduced Intake Of Food

* The text mentions that the Buddha also tried reducing his food intake, but it does not provide details about this method.

# The Gods' Observation

* The gods observed the Buddha during his practice of meditation without breath.
* They commented on his state, with some believing he was dead or dying, while others recognized him as an arahant (an enlightened being).

# Then, Aggivessana, I thought: 'Let me completely abstain from taking food'.

* The gods approached Gotama and offered to feed him divine nutritive essence through his skin if he abstained from food.
* Gotama rejected this offer, believing it would be untruthful.

# Then, Aggivessana, I thought: 'Let me take food little by little, drop by drop, soup of kidney-beans, or soup of vetch, or soup of chick-peas, or soup of peas'.

* Gotama's body became extremely thin from this limited diet.
* His limbs became like the joints of an ascetic or a kåla.
* His behind became like the foot of a camel.
* His backbone became bent and curved.
* His ribs broke off and fell apart.
* The glitter in his eyes became deep and low-lying.
* The skin on his head became shriveled and withered.

# Then indeed, Aggivessana, [thinking:] 'I shall touch the skin of my belly', I got hold of my backbone, [thinking:] 'I shall touch my backbone', I got hold of the skin of my belly

* Gotama's skin had become stuck to his backbone due to malnutrition.
* He was unable to defecate or urinate properly and fell down headfirst.

# Then indeed, Aggivessana, soothing this my body I rubbed over my limbs with my hand.

* The hairs on Gotama's body fell out because their roots had become fetid.
* People commented on Gotama's appearance, some saying he was black, others brown, and others that his skin was fair.

# Then, Aggivessana, I thought: 'The recluses or Brahmins of the past who experienced painful, sharp, severe sensations [which were] due to [self- inflicted] torture, [experienced] this much at the most, not more than this.

* Gotama reflected on the suffering endured by other ascetics and realized that his own practices were not leading to enlightenment.
* He questioned whether there was another path to enlightenment.





# The Episode from the Ekottara Ógama and the Majjhima Nikåya

* Both versions of the story describe Gautama's extreme ascetic practices before achieving enlightenment.
* The Ekottara Ógama version likely came later, influenced by Mahāyāna Buddhism. 
* It reverses the order of events, placing reduced food intake before meditation without breath.
* This reversal creates inconsistency and suggests a muddled tradition in the Ekottara Ógama.

# The Ekottara Ógama Version

*  Preserves indications that the practices were originally non-Buddhist, possibly Jaina:
    * Gods call Gautama an arhat.
    * Gautama intends to fast to death but abandons the idea.
* Lacks a description of meditation without breath found in the Pali version.
* This omission may be due to Buddhists adopting the practice themselves later on.

# The Majjhima Nikåya Version

* Provides three different contexts for the episode, one being particularly relevant:
    * The Mahāsaccaka Sutta portrays a conversation between Buddha and Saccaka Nigaṇṭhaputta (Aggivessana), likely a Jaina.
    * Saccaka criticizes recluses who focus solely on body or mind cultivation, suggesting Jainas balance both.

* This context implies the episode critiques other ascetic practices, possibly those of Ój¥vikas.


# The Significance of Context

* The Mahāsaccaka Sutta's context suggests the episode was originally meant to criticize non-Buddhist practices, likely Jaina.
* Other contexts in the Majjhima Nikåya provide less insight into the episode's purpose.

# Something can be said about the date of composition of the episode on meditation without breath and reduced intake of food.

* It must have been well before the final redaction of the Påli canon, because additions were made to the Original Mahåsaccaka SËtra.
* The Påli canon was written down in the first century B.C., so our episode must be much earlier than this.
* One feature allows us to tentatively push this date back considerably: the Bodhisattva abandoned his intention to fast to death.

# These four comparisons must have occurred in the original version of our episode.

* "Just as when a strong man may destroy a head with the sharp edge of a sword, just so indeed extremely strong winds shook up my head"
* "Just as when a strong man may place a turban on a head with a strong strip of leather, just so indeed there came about extremely strong headaches in my head"
* "Just as when a skilled butcher or apprentice of a butcher may cut a belly all around with a sharp butcher's knife, just so indeed extremely strong winds cut my belly all around"
* "Just as when two strong men, taking a weaker man by both his arms, may burn and roast him on a pit of burning coal, just so indeed there came about an extremely strong heat in my body."

# Another apparently borrowed part in the episode is the description of the horrible effects of the future Buddha's reduced intake of food.

* It occurs in both the Påli and the Chinese versions.
* It occurs again in the Mahås¥hanåda Sutta of the Majjhima Nikåya (nr. 12, MN I.80) and, in a somewhat different form, in the Shên mao hsi shu ching.

# The most interesting result is that, probably in the third century B.C., a Buddhist gave a description of a non-Buddhist method of cultivating the mind called 'meditation' (jhåna / dhyåna).

* Stripped from obvious exaggerations and repetitions it presents this picture: Among the non-Buddhists (Jainas), meditation was a forceful effort to restrain the mind and bring it to a standstill.
* Along with it, but perhaps only in a more advanced stage of meditation, breathing is stopped.
* This form of non-Buddhist meditation is contrasted with Buddhist meditation in the Mahåsaccaka Sutta, and probably also in the Original Mahåsaccaka SËtra.

# More information about the Jainas that is of interest to us can be gathered from various places in the Buddhist canon

* This section mentions a conversation between the Buddha and Sakka named Mahånåma. 
* The conversation focuses on the practices of Jainas who stand erect for long periods, enduring pain as a form of asceticism.
* The Jainas believe this practice helps them exhaust past sins and achieve liberation from suffering.

# The emphasis on bodily practices among the Jainas is explicitly mentioned in the Upåli Sutta /SËtra

* This section highlights the differing views of Buddhists and Jainas regarding the worst kind of bad activity.
* Jainas consider bodily activities to be the worst, while Buddhists believe mental bad activities are more detrimental.

# The Indriyabhåvanå Sutta of the Majjhima Nikåya criticizes such 'cultivation of the senses' (indriyabhåvanå) as leads to their non-functioning

* This section explains that the Buddha criticized a practice called "indriyabhåvanå," which aimed to suppress sensory experience.
* The Buddha argued that true cultivation of the senses involves equanimity towards sensory experiences, not their suppression.





# Practices of Non-Buddhist Ascetics

* These practices were viewed by Buddhists as having negative intent.
* They included abstention from all food until death.
* Another practice involved "meditation without breath," aiming to halt mental processes and breathing.
* A third practice sought to stop the senses from functioning, preventing the perception of form, sound, etc.

# Common Denominator in Non-Buddhist Practices

* All these practices aimed at non-activity of the body or mind.
* This goal was likely driven by the desire to avoid the negative consequences of activity (karma).

# Buddhist Response to Non-Buddhist Practices

* Buddhists were against these practices, contrasting them with their own methods.
* Instead of fasting, restraining the mind, and stopping the breath, Buddhists advocated for the Four Dhyanas.
* Rather than aiming for non-functioning senses, Buddhists emphasized equanimity in the face of sensory experiences.

# Description of Jainist Practice from Óyåraµga

* This passage describes a voluntary starvation to death accompanied by restraint of activity and movement.
* It is presented as the culmination of a life dedicated to training and preparation.
* The emphasis on restraint stems from the Jain belief that suffering arises from activity (karma).
* The goal is to cease all activity to achieve liberation.

# 3.2 For such information we turn to a slightly younger text, the Uttarajjhayaˆa, chapter 29

* This chapter deals with the effects of various practices.
* Some statements are comparable with earlier findings, others shed new light on them.
* Comparable statements confirm that liberation is achieved by ceasing all activity.
* The culmination of this process is described: after preserving his life for a certain time, the monk stops all activities and enters pure meditation (sukkajjhåˆa).

# 3.3 A more detailed description of 'pure meditation' is found in the no doubt later Èhåˆaµga Sutta

* Pure meditation is classified into four kinds:
    * Consideration of multiplicity and changes of object.
    * Consideration of oneness and no change of object.
    * Activity has become subtle and from which there is no return.
    * All activity has been cut off and from which one does not fall back.

* The third and fourth kind are described similarly to the passage from the Uttarajjhayaˆa (29.72 / 1174).


# 3.4 The description of pure meditation in the Èhåˆaµga Sutta does not stand alone

* Pure meditation is presented as one (the last) of four types of dhyåna.
* The other three types are: afflicted, wrathful, and pious dhyåna.
* These four types of dhyåna came to be looked upon as four types of meditation.
* This led to the Viyåhapaˆˆatti Sutta and the Uvavåiya Sutta distinguishing six kinds of inner asceticism, with the fifth being meditation (dhyåna).



# The Idea of Four Types of Dhyana

* The idea may have originated from a verse in the Uttarajjhayaˆa (30.35/1211).
* It's unclear if there's a distinction between dhamma jhåˆa and sukka jhåˆa.
* Pure meditation (sukka jhåˆa) might be 'in accordance with the doctrine' (dhamma).

# Early Jaina Meditation

* Early Jaina meditation was part of a broader effort to halt all bodily and mental activities, even breathing.
* Techniques included reflections on infinity, change, inauspicious things, and sin.
* Precursors to meditation likely involved forbearance, freedom, softness, and straightness.
* Supporting practices encompassed onepointedness, mind watchfulness, holding the mind together, and sense-organ subjugation.

# Characteristics of Meditation

* Characterized by absence of agitation, delusion, discriminating insight, and renunciation.

# Four Kinds of Manifestations

* Described as four steps towards perfection:
    1. Consideration of multiplicity and change in objects.
    2. Consideration of oneness and unchanging objects.
    3. Subtle activity with no return.
    4. Cessation of all activity with no regression.

# The Fourfold Division

* Dividing meditation into afflicted, wrathful, pious, and pure is unreliable.
* Likely created by early systematisers as a division of "dhyåna," which means both 'thought' and 'meditation.'
* Later theorists mistakenly applied this to meditation only, impacting the history of Jaina meditation. 




# 4.1. The Main Idea Of The Road To Liberation In Early Jainism Is Also Expressed In Bhagavad G¥Tå (Bhg) 18.3 :70

* Some wise men say that all activity should be abandoned as evil.
* A Muni who behaves like a Muni by abandoning desires, renouncing activity, and conquering his senses reaches perfection in the world.
* Such a muni is described as having clean teeth, cut nails, being always bathed and adorned, not bound, and performing only pure actions.

# 4.2. Restraint of breath has been referred to a few times in the passages discussed in § 3.1.

* BhG 4.29 speaks of those who have stopped the movements of breathing in (pråˆa) and breathing out (apåna) are devoted to pråˆåyåma.
* This suggests that the term pråˆåyåma can refer to a complete cessation of breathing.
* The passage from MBh 12.304.8-10 states that fixing the mind and restraint of breath (pråˆåyåma) are the highest forms of Yoga.

# 4.3. Fasting to death was practised by Yayåti (MBh 1.81.10-16):

* King Yayåti anointed his younger son PËru king and then gladly departed for the forest.
* He fasted to death in the forest.

# Fasting and Restraint of Breath

* The text describes various forms of fasting and restraint of breath as a means to achieve liberation.
* It mentions practices like eating only fruits and roots, gleaning, consuming remains of food, surviving on water, air, and eventually ether.
* These practices are accompanied by asceticism, such as standing on one foot for six months or enduring the five fires.

# Early Jaina Meditation

* The text highlights similarities between early Jaina and Hindu meditation practices.
* Both traditions emphasize bodily and mental stillness, conquering the senses, and achieving a state of motionlessness.
* Fasting to death and restraint of breath are also common elements in both traditions.

# Mainstream Meditation

* The author argues that early Jaina and Hindu meditations belong to the same tradition, which can be termed "mainstream meditation."
* This type of meditation is characterized by its focus on achieving a state free from activity through disciplined practice.

# Criticism of Actionless Liberation

* The Bhagavad Gita criticizes the notion that liberation can be achieved simply by abstaining from actions.
* It argues that complete inactivity is impossible for embodied beings due to the influence of guṇas (qualities) arising from Original Nature (Prakṛti).

# Discipline of Knowledge

* The Bhagavad Gita introduces an alternative path to liberation called "discipline of knowledge" (jñānayoga).
* This discipline involves understanding the true nature of the soul, which is distinct from the body and does not perform actions.
* It emphasizes that knowledge of the Imperishable Soul leads to liberation in this life.

# The Unseizable Soul

* The text describes the soul as unseizable, indestructible, unattached, unbound, and unaffected by actions.
* It emphasizes that true liberation comes from recognizing the nature of the soul and transcending the limitations of the physical body.

## 4.4.6:103

* He who has no desire, is free from desire, whose desire is satisfied, whose desire is the Soul - his breaths do not depart.
* This thought influenced later philosophical systems like Sāmkhya and Vedānta, which conceive of the soul as motionless and uninvolved in body and mind activity.

## 5.2

* Some believe knowledge alone is sufficient for liberation from actions' results, while others prefer combining knowledge with ascetic and meditative practices.
* Reasons for this combination are given in Apastambīya Dharma Sūtra 2.9.21.13-16: Abandoning truth and falsehood, pleasure and pain, the Vedas, this world and the next, one should seek the soul.

## 5.3

* Ascetic practices are considered a precondition for acquiring knowledge of the soul.
* The Bhagavad G¥tå's karmayoga is not directly relevant to this discussion.

## 5.4

* In Nyåya-Vaiße∑ika philosophy, the soul is conceived as acting and experiencing the fruits of its actions, but in a technical sense that modifies the situation considerably.
* The soul is an omnipresent and eternal substance (dravya), implying it is motionless. It acts because it can have effort (prayatna) as a quality.



## Summary

**1. Liberation According to the Vaiśeṣikas**

* Emancipation (apavarga) involves cessation of all effects, including good ones.
* Some later Naiyāyikas viewed liberation as blissful.
* The soul is omnipresent and free from action despite being connected to qualities through inherence.

**2. Soul and Body in Vaiśeṣika Philosophy**

* The soul is considered unconnected to the world in its deepest essence, similar to the Sāṃkhya view.
* Unlike Sāṃkhyas, Vaiśeṣikas believe the soul can connect with the world through inherence.
* The omnipresence of the soul is explained by its freedom from action and connection with qualities.

**3. Paths to Liberation in Vaiśeṣika Thought**

* Knowledge is the beginning of the path to liberation.
* Practice, similar to Yoga, is required for attaining liberation.
* Liberation involves the absence of contact between the soul and virtue/sin.
* Practices like fasting, chastity, and dwelling in a forest are mentioned as means to achieve liberation.

**4. Evolution of Meditation Techniques**

* "Pure" forms of asceticism coexisted with currents emphasizing meditation and knowledge of the soul.
* Terms related to meditation were often reinterpreted to refer to bodily practices.
* Mental practices were sometimes postponed until after mastery of complex bodily practices.

**5. Haṭha Yoga and Rāja Yoga**

* Haṭha Yoga emphasizes bodily practices as preparation for Rāja Yoga, which involves a unified mind and the state of samādhi (concentration).
* Mastery over Kevala-kumbhaka (breath control) is considered essential for attaining Rāja Yoga.
* Verses from the Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā describe the characteristics of a yogi in samādhi, including motionlessness, cessation of breathing, and non-functioning senses.

**6. Mainstream Meditation vs. Buddhist Meditation**


* Mainstream meditation likely remained largely unaffected by Buddhist meditation for a long time.
* Its widespread presence in Jaina and Hindu scriptures suggests its broader appeal.
* The simplicity of the idea that inactivity combats misery may have contributed to its popularity compared to more complex Buddhist methods.

# Influence from Buddhist Meditation

* Noticeable influence in a passage of the Mahåbhårata, but remains confined to terminology.
* Strong influence can be seen in the Yoga SËtra. 
* The important position acquired by this text explains that the Buddhist element in Hindu meditation came to stay.

# Influence from Buddhist Meditation in the Mahåbhårata

* A passage in the Mahåbhårata (MBh 12.188.1-2, 5-10, 12-13, 15, 20-22) describes a 'fourfold dhyånayoga' and a 'first Dhyåna'.
* This description sounds like pure Buddhism.
* The passage mentions only the First Dhyåna repeatedly, never the remaining three.
* This suggests that the later Dhyånas were an embarrassment for the author because they go beyond his aim of controlling the mind and senses.

# Influence from Buddhist Meditation in the Yoga SËtra

* Contradiction between sËtras 1.2-16 and 1.17-20 suggests two kinds of Yoga are being referred to.
* SËtras 1.2-16 describe main stream meditation, defining Yoga as the suppression of mental activity.
* SËtras 1.17-20 describe a state beyond happiness and the feeling 'I am', where even subliminal impressions are destroyed.
* This description aligns with Buddhist meditation.



# Deliberation and Reflection

*  Deliberation (vitarka) and reflection (vicåra) are present in the First Dhyåna of Buddhists.
* Joy ( pr¥ti) is present in the First and Second Dhyåna, bliss (sukha) in the First, Second and Third; this corresponds to happiness (ånanda).

# Asaµprajñåta Samådhi

* Only the feeling 'I am' has nothing corresponding to it in early Buddhist texts.
* Asaµprajñåta samådhi may be compared with five states added after the Four Dhyånas in Buddhist scriptures, characterized by weakening and disappearance of ideation (samjñå).

# Influence from Buddhism on Yoga SËtra

* Dependence on Buddhist ideas is confirmed by the fact that asaµprajñåta samådhi is said to be preceded by trust (ßraddhå), energy (v¥rya), mindfulness (sm®ti), concentration (samådhi), and insight ( prajñå).
* The last two, samådhi and prajñå, are also the last two of the Buddhist triad - samådhi, prajñå.

# Traces of Buddhist Meditation in Other Works

* Yogakuˆ∂al¥ Upani∑ad mentions subconscious impressions (våsanå) and air as causes for mind activity.
* The text suggests destroying air first through techniques like moderate eating, postures, and setting Íakti in motion.
* While the terms våsanå ('subconscious impression') and saµskåra ('subliminal impression') are synonyms, the Upani∑ad's focus on breath control suggests slight Buddhist influence, possibly terminological.

# Muktikå Upani∑ad

* The Muktikå Upani∑ad (MuktU) more strongly represents Buddhist meditation.
* Verse 2.27 states that the mind has two seeds: movement of breath and subconscious impression; destroying one destroys both.
* The Upani∑ad emphasizes destroying subconscious impressions for liberation, classifying them as pure and impure.

# Influence from Mainstream Meditation on Buddhism


*  Buddhist meditation likely absorbed elements from mainstream meditation due to its prevalence in India.
* Buddhist scriptures show attention to other forms of meditation or asceticism.
* Devadatta's five demands to the Buddha include three stereotyped descriptions of heretics found in Buddhist canon, suggesting influence from mainstream asceticism.

# More Instances of Borrowing


* The Mahåparinirvåˆa SËtra recounts Putkasa's story about Órå∂a Kålåma's ability to ignore external stimuli, which Buddhists ridiculed but later accepted, surpassing Órå∂a Kålåma in this regard.
*  The Majjhima Nikåya (Vitakkasanthåna Sutta) advises monks on a meditation technique involving teeth clenching, tongue pressing, and thought restraint, similar to mainstream meditation practices.

# The Eight Liberations

* These are a list of graded exercises by which the practitioner gradually puts an end to all ideations. 
* In the Stage of Nothingness the most ethereal of ideations alone remain.
* In the following two states even this ideation disappears.

# Another List of Meditations

* This list also describes a process of eliminating ideations, culminating in animitta cetosamådhi (mental concentration beyond [any ideation of] characteristics). 
* The last state appears superfluous and may be an attempt to fit animitta cetosamådhi into the list.

# The Four Arūpas / Ārūpyas

* This is a core unit of four meditational states: Stage of Infinity of Space, Stage of Infinity of Perception, Stage of Nothingness, Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation.

# The Seven Places of Perception

* These are places where beings exist with different combinations of bodies and ideations.
* This list omits the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation because perception is always accompanied by ideation in this stage.

# The Nine Residences of Beings

* This list adds two items to the Seven Places of Perception: Residence of Beings without ideations and feelings, and Residence of Beings in the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation.

# Final Stages

* The Stage of Nothingness and the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation are the final states in a process of increasing abstraction.
* In these stages, the mind is fixed on notions like "space is infinite" or "there is nothing."
* These stages were likely aims in themselves at one point, as evidenced by stories about the Buddha's teachers.

# 7.2 The Stages Prior to Enlightenment

* The Bodhisattva's training under Órå∂a Kålåma and Udraka the son of Råma was likely added later to explain the presence of these two names in early Buddhist texts.
* This story may have been created to criticize those who believed that the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation was the final goal of spiritual practice.

# 7.2.1 The Four Stages and Their Origin

* The four stages - Stage of Infinity of Space, Stage of Infinity of Perception, Stage of Nothingness, and Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation - are likely borrowed from Jainistic or related meditative practices.
* These stages share similarities with Jaina reflections on infinity and the cessation of mental activity.

# 7.2.2 Assimilation into Buddhism

* The Four Dhyånas in Buddhism may have been assimilated with these four stages, particularly the Stage of Neither Ideation nor Non-Ideation resembling the Second Dhyåna.
* However, the differences between the two systems made a complete assimilation difficult.

# 7.2.3 Alternative Path to Liberation

* The four stages likely represented an alternative path to liberation in their original context, different from the Buddhist one.
* Some Buddhist schools, like the Vibhajyavådins and Theravådins, believed that arhant-ship could be attained through these stages at the end of one's final existence.

# 7.2.4 Further Evidence for External Origin


* The focus on Space (åkåßa) and Perception (vijñåna) in the four stages points to an external origin, possibly related to Jaina practices.


## Chapter 7: Influence of Mainstream Meditation on Buddhist Meditation

* **7.1.** The Theravadin tradition does not provide a clear reference for the origin of the four dhyanas.

* **7.2.**  The concept of "Stages" in meditation, like the Four Stages of Absorption (dhyana) and the Four Stages of Formlessness (arupa), may have been influenced by earlier Indian traditions. 

* **7.3.** The Brahmic States (brahmavihara) were practiced by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists, but Buddhists believed these practices led to Nirvāṇa while non-Buddhist practitioners experienced only temporary bliss in heavenly realms.

* **7.4.** Uncertainty about the Buddha's original teachings may have allowed for the incorporation of external influences into Buddhist meditation practices. Despite this, some practices like the Four Dhyanas and mindfulness appear to be authentically Buddhist.

## Chapter 8: Influence of Mainstream Ideas on Buddhist Conception of Liberation

* **8.1.**  Mainstream asceticism typically focused on liberation after death. Buddhism's emphasis on liberation in this life might have been influenced by outside ideas, leading to a tendency to postpone liberation to the afterlife and emphasize liberating insight as central to the path.

* **8.2.** Buddhist scriptures frequently affirm that liberation can be attained in this life, both for the Buddha himself and for his followers.

* **8.3.**  The influence of mainstream thought might have led to a shift towards emphasizing liberation after death in some Buddhist teachings.
* **8.4.** The concept of liberating insight may have been strengthened by outside influences, becoming a central element in Buddhist practice. 




## 8. The Early Buddhist Concept of Liberation

### 8.3. Postponement of Liberation

* Nirvāṇa is sometimes described as occurring after death, distinguishing it from enlightenment attainable in life.
* This distinction appears in passages that differentiate between Nirvāṇa (without a remainder of upadhi) and the "highest and complete enlightenment" (anuttara samyaksaµbodhi).
* The Nigrodhakappa Sutta supports this view by stating that Nigrodhakappa reached Nirvāṇa after death.

### 8.4. Liberating Insight in Early Buddhism

* Early Buddhists believed in liberation in this life, leading to questions about the specific insight required for liberation.
* Since they couldn't rely on soul-based explanations like their contemporaries, they emphasized what they considered most essential to Buddhist doctrine as liberating insight.
* Three key points emerge regarding liberating insight:
    * **Varied Content:** The content of liberating insight varied depending on what was considered central to the Buddha's teachings.
    * **Insight vs. Practice:** Insight and practice competed for importance, similar to mainstream meditation traditions.
    * **Possible Absence of Explicit Description:** Early Buddhist texts suggest that liberating insight may not have been explicitly described initially.

* The principle that Enlightenment and Liberating Insight are characterized by containing the most fundamental truth is evident in later periods as well.
* Examples include:
    * Comprehension of the Four Noble Truths being supplemented or supplanted by the Comprehension of Origination-inDependence (prat¥tyasamutpåda).
    * The doctrine of non-existence of a substantial self ([pudgala-]nairåtmya) becoming central to Liberating Insight.

* Schmithausen highlights other forms of liberating insight in the Buddhist canon, such as:
    * Understanding the impermanence, unpleasantness, and non-self nature of the five Skandhas.
    * Contemplation of the arising and disappearance (udayabbaya) of the five Skandhas.
    * Realizing the emptiness, futility, and lack of substance in the Skandhas.

* The competition between insight and practice is evident in canonical Buddhism, as exemplified by Mus¥la (representing knowledge) and Nårada (representing direct experience).
* These schools parallel those found in mainstream meditation, suggesting influence from it on Buddhism.





# 8.4.3. Liberating Insight

* In some Buddhist schools, a state similar to Nirvåˆa was achieved before death.
* This state was seen as an anticipation of Nirvåˆa and liberation.
* The stereotyped description of the path to liberation often places liberating insight in the Fourth Dhyåna.

# 8.4.3. Liberating Insight (continued)

* The passage describing liberating insight mentions recognizing suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.
* This recognition is likely a later addition to the original account of enlightenment.
* It serves as a bridge between the Four Noble Truths and the destruction of intoxicants.

# 8.4.3. Liberating Insight (continued)

* The Four Noble Truths do not fit well in this context because they describe knowledge needed at the beginning of the path, not at its end.
* The Buddha already knew the path before attaining enlightenment, so the Four Noble Truths could not have been his liberating insight.

# 8.4.3. Liberating Insight (continued)

* The Four Noble Truths are specified in several places as knowledge needed before embarking on the path to liberation.
* They describe the path itself and are therefore not suitable as a final, liberating insight.

# 8.4.3. Liberating Insight (continued)

* Some versions of the Buddha's first sermon suggest that the Four Noble Truths were not initially considered central to Buddhism.
* This supports the idea that they did not constitute liberating insight in earliest Buddhism.

# What Liberating Insight Was Like in Earliest Buddhism

* The Four Noble Truths likely weren't considered liberating insight in earliest Buddhism. 
* Buddhists were often asked about their liberating insight because they believed in liberation in this life.
* Buddhist texts often mention 'insight' (prajñå / paññå) as preceding liberation, which may have led to the idea of a specific liberating insight.

# A Proposal About the Development of Liberating Insight

* Passages describing liberating insight as the Four Noble Truths might have originally only mentioned prajñå.
* Later tradition replaced prajñå with the Four Noble Truths wherever possible, except in contexts involving Cessation of Ideations and Feelings (saµjñå- /saññåvedayitanirodha).

# What Prajñå Might Have Meant

* If prajñå didn't refer to the Four Noble Truths, what was it?
* It likely referred to an unspecified and unspecifiable kind of insight.
* After reaching the fourth Dhyåna, the aspirant needed insight into their psychic state and its possibilities. This is what prajñå might have been.

# The Buddha's Teaching Style

* General statements like the Four Noble Truths wouldn't have been helpful for advanced disciples.
* The Buddha likely gave them personal advice tailored to their needs.

# Parallels with Mainstream Meditation

* There are parallels between Buddhist views on liberating insight and those in mainstream meditation, which emphasizes insight alone, practice alone, or a combination of both.




# 9.1. We Have Seen That Buddhist Meditation Formed A Tradition Different From The Meditation And Ascetic Practices Found In Jainism And In Many Hindu Scriptures

* There is little reason to doubt that this mainstream of asceticism existed before the beginnings of Buddhism.
* It is more interesting to investigate whether Buddhist meditation existed before the Buddha.

# 9.2. Nothing like Buddhist meditation is, understandably, referred to in early Jaina literature. Vedic literature is for the most part silent about any form of meditation. Not until the oldest Upaniṣads do we find any references to it.
* The earliest sentence that is of interest refers to mainstream meditation.

# 9.2.1. My first argument is based on Horsch, 1966: 391f. I shall briefly and in a somewhat modified way restate Horsch's view.

* Patañjali explains that the Brāhmaṇa works uttered by Yājñavalkya are of the same time as Pāṇini.
* We must rather understand from this varttika that Kátyāyana was still aware of the recent origin of the 'Brāhmaṇa works uttered by Yājñavalkya'.

# 9.2.3. Further evidence regarding the late date of the BÓU, and of the later chapters of the ÍB as well, can be derived from a closer inspection of the figure of Yājñavalkya.
* Pronouncements of Yājñavalkya occur repeatedly in ÍB 1-4.

# 9.2.4. We turn to a question which is directly related to our chronological observations. The ÍB, including the BÓU, is one of the late Vedic texts which preserve Vedic accents. Both were composed in a time when Vedic accents were still in use. Also the language described by Pāṇini contains Vedic accents as an integral part. If then the origin of Buddhism is earlier than (portions of) the BÓU, can it be that the earliest layers of Buddhist literature contain indications that Vedic accent was still used?
* Lévi thinks that this accent could not have been transposed mechanically from the sacred texts of the Veda onto the sacred texts of Buddhism and concludes: "Les premier essais de littérature canonique iraient donc rejoindre l'époque des derniers textes accentués du canon védique: le Brāhmaṇa, l'Óraṇyaka des Taittirīya et le Íatapatha Brāhmaṇa."
* Lévi argues his case on the basis of texts taken from the Vinaya work Skandhaka.



## 9.2.5. Ajatasatru

* The BÓU mentions a K∑atriya named 'Ajåtaßatru' who interacts with D®ptabålåki Gårgya.
* This name is not found in Vedic literature except in the BÓU and Kau∑¥taki Upani∑ad 4.
* Buddhist texts depict Ajåtaßatru as king of Magadha, not Kåߥ as suggested by the BÓU.

## 9.2.6. Yajñavalkya and Maitreyi

* The BÓU contains two versions of a discussion between Yåjñavalkya and his wife Maitrey¥.
* One version focuses on the åtman, while the other deals with mahad bhËtam, a concept with both universal-cosmic and individual aspects.

## 9.2.7. Transmigration in the BÓU

* The BÓU presents the belief in transmigration as something new, unlike Buddhism which presupposes it.
* This suggests that the BÓU might be older than Buddhism or an attempt to sanctify a growing belief among Brahmins.
* Early Buddhist texts may have been confronted with people who didn't believe in transmigration.

## 9.2.8. Language and Dating of the BÓU

* The Vedic features in the BÓU's language don't necessarily make it older than classical Sanskrit or Påˆini's grammar.
* Vedic and classical Sanskrit may have coexisted for a period.

## 9.3. Pre-Buddhist Meditation

* No traces of pre-Buddhistic 'Buddhist meditation' are found in non-Buddhist literature.
* Buddhist scriptures don't ascribe meditational techniques to outsiders, including the 'six heretics'.
* The Buddha is said to have discovered his meditational techniques himself, as evidenced by a passage describing his attainment of the First Dhyåna as a child.





## The Origin of Buddhist Meditation

**9.4. The Early Development of Buddhist Meditation**

* None of the early Indian scriptures, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, indicate that the Buddhist form of meditation existed before Buddhism.
* Some Buddhist texts describe the Buddha as an innovator in meditation techniques.
* This suggests that Buddhist meditation was introduced by the historical Buddha.

**10.1. The Concept of Pratyekabuddhas and its Implications**

* Early Buddhist tradition viewed the Buddha's teachings as new and unknown before him.
* Later, the concept of Pratyekabuddhas (enlightened beings who did not preach) emerged, challenging this view.
* Some believe the Khaggavisåˆa Sutta in the Sutta Nipåta contains utterances of Pratyekabuddhas.

**10.2. The Khaggavisåˆa Sutta and its Significance**

* The Khaggavisåˆa Sutta praises solitary wandering, a practice common in early Buddhism.
* The Sutta refers to the Buddha by name, indicating it was composed after his time.
* This suggests that the idea of Pratyekabuddhas composing the Sutta is a later invention.

**10.3. Outside Influences on Early Buddhist Texts**

* Collections like the Sutta Nipåta, likely originating from solitary wanderers, may show traces of outside influence.
* Some verses in these texts resemble ascetic practices found in Jainism and Hinduism.
* This borrowing might explain the uncertain canonicity of these works despite their age.

**11.1. The Influence of Pre-Buddhist Asceticism on Buddhism**

* Ancient Indian religions practiced asceticism and meditation to escape action-induced suffering and rebirth.
* Buddhist scriptures criticize this tradition, but some practices and ideas infiltrated Buddhism.
* Examples include the Eight Liberations (last five steps) and the Brahmic States.

**11.2. Future Directions for Research**


* Philology has reached its limits in understanding Buddhist meditation.
* Further research requires a different approach, potentially exploring the lived experience of meditation.
