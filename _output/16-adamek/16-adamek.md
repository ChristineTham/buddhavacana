# Part I: Practicescapes

Chapter One





## "Practicescape"

* There is a network of rock-cut caves, inscriptions, and statues at Baoshan in Henan province, China. 
* This site holds the largest collection of medieval Chinese Buddhist nun inscriptions.
* The study explores the interconnectedness of doctrine, practice, and carvings at Baoshan.

## Baoshan Was Meant to Be At Work Beyond Itself

* Baoshan is a place where Buddhist teachings are put into practice.
* Like pilgrimage sites in Buddhist scriptures, it offers visions of other realms and times.
* The site encourages practitioners to see beyond the illusion of a fixed self.

##  Baoshan as a Bodhimaṇḍa

* Baoshan has been a place of Buddhist practice since the sixth century.
* It is considered a *bodhimaṇḍa*, a "seat of awakening," where practitioners can attain enlightenment.
* The site's development reflects the adaptation of Buddhism to the Chinese landscape and culture.

## Practicescapes: An Interlocking of Activities

* Baoshan is viewed as a "practicescape," combining the Buddhist concept of *bodhimaṇḍa* with Timothy Ingold's idea of "taskscape."
* It encompasses activities related to livelihood, dwelling, and skill, ultimately aiming for liberation from worldly concerns.
* The site's carvings and inscriptions demonstrate a skillful adaptation of techniques and beliefs to achieve enlightenment.

##  Dwelling in Harmony and Interconnection

* Exploring Baoshan encourages reflection on our relationship with the environment.
* Buddhist insights offer perspectives on finding new ways of living harmoniously with nature.
* Confronting the ambivalence of interconnection can lead to more sustainable practices.





## Backstories

* Viewed from a distance, the long stretch of relative stability from the establishment of the Sui in 589 to the disruption of the Tang 唐 (618-906) in the mid-eighth century was a flourishing era for the practice community at Baoshan.
* This period encompasses the largest number of extant datable mortuary-niche inscriptions.

## The Northern Wei

* The Northern Wei was formed when Tuoba Gui's armies moved into present-day Shanxi and Hebei during the latter part of the fourth century.
* Buddhist monk Faguo won approval of both Taizu and his successor, leading to good relations between court and clergy until Emperor Taiwu launched a violent persecution of Buddhism in the mid-fifth century.

## The Northern Qi

* The downfall of the perpetrators of the persecution unleashed a deluge of Buddhist piety, engaging all levels of society and diverse ethnic groups.
* Buddhism served as the primary unifying force for the state during the latter half of the fifth century.
* The pace of territorial expansion slowed, leading to merit-seeking excesses that overburdened the Northern Wei economic system.

## The Sui Dynasty

* The Northern Qi was destroyed in 577 by the Northern Zhou, which also supplanted the regime of the Western Wei.
* The Northern Zhou Emperor enforced a second major persecution of Buddhism from 574-577.
* In 580, Yang Jian became regent and established himself as Emperor Wen of the Sui (r. 581-604), reunifying north and south in 589.

## The Tang Dynasty

* Under Emperor Wen's pro-Buddhist regime, Baoshan became a major Buddhist site.
* His son Yang Guang gained the throne in 604 but his brutal reign was marked by widespread rebellions.
* In 618, Li Yuan established the Tang dynasty.

## Empress Wu

* After Gaozong's death, Empress Wu succeeded in establishing herself as the founder of a new dynasty, the Zhou (690-705).
* She issued proscriptions against the Sanjie movement, which may have caused Baoshan to be viewed with disfavor.

## The Golden Age and Beyond

* After a coup, followed by Empress Wu's death in 705, the Tang was reestablished under Emperor Zhongzong and then his brother Emperor Ruizong.
* It did not regain firm footing until Ruizong abdicated in favor of his son Li Longji, who became Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712-756).
* His reign is considered to have been the "golden age" of Tang culture.

## Baoshan's Origins and Development

* Baoshan seems to have first attracted Buddhist attention due to its proximity to one of the passes through the Taihang mountains that linked the Northern Qi capital of Ye with Luoyang and Jinyang.
* In the Tang, Baoshan was part of Xiangzhou province and located west of its capital city, also called Xiangzhou but now known as Anyang.

## Daoping and Lingyu

* It is said that Baoshan was first marked as a Buddhist place by the monk Daoping during the Eastern Wei.
* Daoping's disciple Lingyu won imperial recognition for the site and probably led the design and construction of the main cave-shrine.

## The Dilun School

* Baoshan's founders shared a distinguished heritage stemming from the brief but brilliant efflorescence of Northern Qi Buddhism.
* Daoping was the disciple of Huiguang, who was later considered the progenitor of the Southern branch of the Dilun school that developed in Ye.


## Mortuary Grove

* This mortuary grove, the site's most notable feature, spread across two mountains over the centuries.
* Baoshan and Lanfengshan have seen the construction of almost two hundred individual mortuary niches dedicated by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen to commemorate deceased teachers and family members.

# Antecedents for stūpa-shaped mortuary edifices

* The earliest reliably datable artifacts at Baoshan are reliquary pagodas dedicated in 563.
* These pagodas share a compound with the mummified body of Wu Yunqing, a master who combined Buddhist and Daoist practice.

# From an archaeological point of view

* The site's earliest relics (Daoping's pagodas) and latest relic (the mummified adept) are unrelated.

# From a devotional point of view

* Daoping's pagodas and the mummified adept share the same practicescape without friction, despite their fields of practice sometimes being in conflict historically.
* The site has seen periods of Buddhist-Daoist polemics and violence.

# Eclecticism at Baoshan

* Current custodians of Baoshan display an eclectic approach, incorporating deities from the broader Chinese religious pantheon alongside Buddhist figures.
* This inclusivity may be driven by the relationship between pilgrimage, tourism, and business.

# Regional social and political identity

* A connection exists between the site's first recorded enshrined remains (Daoping's pagodas) and its latest one (Wu Yunqing).
* The man who oversaw Wu Yunqing's mummification acted as a representative of the state, restoring local sacred sites and lending official sanction to the transmutation of an embodied saint into a regional protector.

# Baoshan's enduring legacy

* Baoshan's mountainsides bear witness to a complex web of spiritual, political, and economic relationships.
* The survival of these traces is remarkable, and there is a hope that they will outlast future generations.

## Spiders And Catalogues

* This section reviews previous catalogues and taxonomies of Baoshan to understand how organizational perspectives shape representations of the site. 
* These catalogues include dedicatory inscriptions, the *Anyangxian jinshi lu*, photographic and archaeological records from the 1920s, a 1991 compendium by the Henan Research Institute, and recent academic studies.

## Reflexive Questioning and SPIDER

* The author emphasizes the importance of reflexive questioning in understanding one's own academic practice and acknowledges the limitations of scholarly reifications.
* Drawing on Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Timothy Ingold's SPIDER model, the author argues for a more embodied and contextualized approach to studying Baoshan.

## Assembling the World in a Box

* Studying an archaeological site involves creating a "meshwork" of knowledge, acknowledging that categorization is both art and science.
* The author compares their approach to assembling a collection of "trouvailles" within a framework of evidence and commentary, similar to Joseph Cornell's shadow boxes.

## Chinese Taxonomies and Foucault's Archaeology

* The author discusses the long-standing tradition of classifying objects in China, referencing Borges' fictional Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge as an example of culturally specific categorization schemes.
* They critique Michel Foucault's archaeology of knowledge for its Eurocentric focus and limited engagement with Asian cultures.

## Baoshan's Dynamic Practicescape

* In contrast to Foucault's view of Chinese culture as static, the author argues that Baoshan reveals a dynamic and heterogeneous practicescape.
* The site's carved stones reflect confrontations and turning points in Chinese Buddhist modes of "developmentally embodied responsiveness."

## Dedicatory Inscriptions At The Caves

* Daliusheng cave has an inscription "Daliusheng ku" and a dated inscription from 546, though the stele it came from is no longer at the cave.
* There's also an inscription mentioning a mason who worked on the cave.
* Dazhusheng cave has a clearly dated inscription from 589 listing images inside the cave.

## Anyangxian Jinshi Lu And Anyangxian Zhi

* Wu Yi compiled two works about Anyang, including inscriptions from Baoshan.
* The *Anyangxian jinshi lu* is a chronological collection of inscriptions, while the *Anyangxian zhi* is an administrative gazetteer.
* The *Anyangxian zhi* provides context for the inscriptions in the *Anyangxian jinshi lu*.

## Shina Bukkyō Shiseki

* Tokiwa Daijō and Sekino Tadashi documented Buddhist sites in China, including Baoshan, in their work *Shina bukkyō shiseki*.
* Their work includes photographs of Baoshan before its destruction during the war and Cultural Revolution.
* They aimed to document Chinese Buddhist history scientifically and reverently.

## Baoshan Lingquan Si

* The most comprehensive catalogue of Baoshan is *Baoshan Lingquan si*, published in 1991 by the Henan Research Institute for the Preservation of Ancient Architecture.
    * It includes fold-out pages cataloguing mortuary niches, pagodas, and images at Baoshan, Lanfengshan, and Shanying shiku.
    * The work provides an overview of the site's condition in 1991 but lacks discussion of Buddhist intellectual and cultural heritage.

## Contemporary Academic Work

* This section highlights two seminal works on Baoshan's inscriptions:
    * Li Yumin's 1998 article "Baoshan Dazhushengku chutan" focuses on the inscriptions of Dazhusheng cave.
    * Ōuchi Fumio's 1997 article "Hōzan Reisenji sekkutsu tomei no kenkyū" focuses on selected mortuary inscriptions.

* Sunkyung Kim's Ph.D. dissertation "Decline of the Law, Death of the Monk" is the most important recent work on Baoshan.
    * It examines Daliusheng and Dazhusheng caves in the context of Northern Dynasties Buddhism.
    * Both Li and Kim emphasize the importance of "final age" eschatology in Buddhist constructions of the northern dynasties.

## Overview Of The Present Work

* This study aims to make research on Baoshan accessible to both historians and archaeologists, while also engaging with Buddhist thought and practice.
* It is structured around themes such as endtime, repentance, agency, soteriology, mediators, women, and mourning.
* The book incorporates quotations from Baoshan inscriptions, Buddhist texts, and secondary sources.



# Conclusions

* This chapter provides an overview of Baoshan's practicescape and how it has been understood over time.
* Different categorizations of Baoshan reflect various perspectives on the activities that took place there.
* The author uses the concept of "chronotopes" to describe the time-space contexts created through discourse about Baoshan.

# Chapter Two Dimensions Of Endtime And Dazhusheng Cave

* This chapter explores how Buddhists at Baoshan understood "endtime."
* The concept of "final age of the Dharma" (mofa 末法, moshi 末世) influenced their practices.
*  Baoshan's inscriptions refer to both the cyclical nature of Dharma and the potential for individual buddhahood.




## A Brief History Of Endtime

* Buddhist tales often feature stories of converting nonhumans to Buddhism, reflecting an ideology focused on saving beings.
* The establishment and maintenance of a *bodhimaṇḍa* (place of practice) relied on dedicated donors who provided resources for practitioners. 
* Maintaining a *bodhimaṇḍa* involved not just physical structures but also the constant flow of bodies, representing the transcendence of identification with being, space, and time.

* "Emptiness" (*śūnyatā*) is a key concept in Chinese Buddhist understanding, emphasizing the lack of inherent self-nature in phenomena.
* The Dilun exegetes approached emptiness through the lens of *tathāgatagarbha* (buddha-matrix) and Yogācāra scriptures.

* At Dazhusheng cave, Śākyamuni's Dharma ending was linked to the Buddha's continuing responsive effect even after his death.
* Cycles of buddhas and their Dharma were understood as the timeless *dharmadhātu*, represented by the universal Buddha Vairocana.
* "Endtime" in Buddhism meant realizing the *dharmadhātu* and transcending the cycle of rebirth and death.

* Chinese Buddhist notions of endtime were influenced by indigenous eschatology, rooted in the Zhou ideology of the Mandate of Heaven.
* During the Han dynasty, this ideology took on messianic qualities, manifested in millenarian movements that sometimes clashed with elite Huang-Lao ideology.
* By the fifth century, Daoist apocalyptic literature developed various cosmologies and etiologies, often condemning the current order.

* Buddhist prophecies about the final age were associated with this indigenous precedent of potentially dangerous messianic movements.
* Buddhist apocryphal works often dealt with eschatological and messianic themes, but faced opposition from clergy and state officials who feared their potential to incite unrest.
* Millenarian and utopian themes were adaptable to hybridization between Buddhism and Daoism.

* Translation of Buddhist canonical works supporting the notion of the final age began in the north in the fourth century.
* Kumārajīva's translation atelier at the court of the Later Qin emperor Yao Xing played a significant role in spreading Chinese Buddhist eschatology.

* The *Diamond Sūtra*, translated by Kumārajīva in 401, provided a foundation for the argument that even simple practices would have special significance in the final age.
* Bodhiruci and Paramārtha, influential translators associated with the Dilun approach, also produced translations of the *Diamond Sūtra*.

* The *Diamond Sūtra* was frequently reproduced as part of the sūtra-preservation project, reflecting its importance in Buddhist endtime beliefs.
* Huisi, a Tiantai patriarch, is often credited with a three-part periodization of the final age: True Dharma, Semblance Dharma, and Final Dharma.

* Claims that "the mofa is now" were viewed negatively by some clerics invested in the status quo.
* Prophetic scriptures described the final age as marked by clerical and political corruption.

## # The Candragarbha-*sūtra* and the Kauśāmbī Prophecy

* The *Candragarbha-sūtra*, translated in 566, contains the most extensive version of the Kauśāmbī prophecy available to Lingyu and his contemporaries.
* Xinxing (540-594) and Daochuo (562-645), both influential figures in Pure Land devotion, also utilized this *sūtra*.

## # Decline Rhetoric and State Regulation

* Dharma-periodization narratives, while linked to themes of civilizational decline and Buddhist persecution, originated from laments about internal corruption within the Buddhist community.
* Nattier argues that decline rhetoric arose from concerns about wealth, worldly involvement, and decadence within the *saṃgha*, as well as external pressures from the state.

## # The Political Climate and *Mofa* Discourse

* While the unstable political climate at the end of the "period of division" (220-589) contributed to the development of *mofa* discourse, it was not the sole factor.
* The Northern Zhou persecution provided concrete evidence for exegetical calculations about the advent of *mofa*.
* Emperor Wen of Sui's patronage of Buddhism from 581 onwards led to a resurgence of the faith, allowing figures like Lingyu to engage in restoration and construction projects.

## # Dazhusheng Cave and Endtime Practice

* The Dazhusheng cave at Baoshan features numerous *mofa* references, including a passage from the *Candragarbha-sūtra* warning about the disappearance of the pure Dharma.
* The cave's inscriptions suggest that its purpose was endtime practice rather than preservation of the Dharma.

## # Leiyin Cave and Preservation of the Dharma

* Launched by Huisi's disciple Jingwan in 605, the Leiyin cave project aimed to preserve the written form of the Dharma through the impending apocalypse.
* The scriptural program at Leiyin cave is extensive and eclectic, including selections from lesser-known texts also featured at Baoshan.

## # Dazhusheng Cave Inscriptions

* Three inscriptions at Dazhusheng cave are discussed in detail:
    * A selection from the "Bu Yanfuti" chapter of the *Candragarbha-sūtra*.
    * A selection from the *Mahāmāyā-sūtra*.
    * The *Lüe li qijie foming chanhui deng wen*, an abridged liturgical text.

## # Scriptural Program at Dazhusheng Cave

* The cave's devotional program includes a complex array of scriptural passages and images, reflecting the influence of mainstream Mahāyāna texts like the Avataṃsaka, Nirvāṇa, *Lotus*, and *Śrīmālādevī* sūtras.
* Specialized passages support repentance practice in the context of the final age.

## # Repentance Practice and Chinese Buddhism


* The importance of repentance practice is reflected in other significant Chinese Buddhist movements, such as the Sanjie movement and subsequent developments in Chan.

## The Candragarbha-Sūtra

* **The Candragarbha-*sūtra***
    *  A multi-layered text known for its versions of Śākyamuni's prophecies about the decline of his Dharma.
    * Translated by Narendrayaśas in 566 and became a key source for East Asian *mofa* discourse.
    * Contains several variations on the decline prophecy, with the Baoshan passage having the most detailed periodization scheme.

* **Support for Precept-Breaking Monks**
    * The scripture emphasizes supporting monks even if they break precepts.
    * This message is found in a concluding section carved on Dazhusheng's southwest inner wall.
    * The Buddha states that even nominal monks, though flawed, can benefit beings and should be supported.

* **Merit of Supporting Monks**
    *  The *Candragarbha* argues for supporting monks who keep precepts imperfectly because:
        * It prevents non-Buddhist teachings from taking over completely.
        * It sets a good example in bad times.
    * Donors who support the Dharma in these circumstances are promised speedy attainment of the first *bhūmi* (ground) of the bodhisattva path.

* **The Significance of the Robe**
    * The *Candragarbha* and related texts, like the Xumizang fen, emphasize the power of the monastic robe.
    * The robe is seen as a conduit to the power of buddhas and bodhisattvas, even when worn by unworthy individuals.

* **Incremental Losses and Refuge in Corruption**
    * The *Candragarbha* outlines a decline where various types of practitioners disappear, leaving only questionable monks.
    * Despite this, the Buddha promises that supporting these nominal vessels of the Dharma is a source of refuge.

* **Miraculous Signs and Transcendence**
    * The final section of the *Candragarbha* asserts that making offerings to precept-breaking monks is like offering them to the Buddha himself.
    * The Buddha recites a *dhāraṇī* to extend the endurance of the True Dharma, resulting in miraculous signs.
    * Falseness becomes a sign recognized by true practitioners, affirming the truth of the Buddha's prophecy.

## The Mahāmāyā-Sūtra

* This sutra is said to have been translated by the monk Tanjing during the southern Xiao Qi dynasty (479–502).
* It includes a brief version of the Kauśāmbi story and a fifteen-hundred-year decline timetable.
* It contrasts with the detailed narrative and twenty-five-hundred-year timetable in the *Candragarbha*.
* It is notable for claiming the Buddha's prediction of the appearance of the Mahāyāna sages Aśvaghoṣa and Nāgārjuna.

## The Dazhusheng *Mahāmāyā* Selection

* This selection focuses on individual liberation rather than the final age.
* It centers on the first part of the sūtra, where the Buddha ascends to Daoli Tian for three months to preach for his mother Mahāmāyā.
* In this narrative arc, the Buddha's ascent to see his mother is complemented by her descent to earth when she hears of his "death."

## Mahāmāyā's Soliloquy

* This passage features Mahāmāyā as the main speaker, receiving her son's prophecy that she will attain the first stage leading to final nirvāṇa.
* The prediction is couched in terms of the pre-Mahāyāna path but presented in a manner suggesting a *bodhicitta*-like moment initiating and encompassing fulfillment of the path. 

## Mahāmāyā's Repentance

* This passage describes the consequences of self-obsessed volitional thought, which produces further conditioning.
* It evokes the wide range of sufferings to which karma-bound beings are subject.
* It places responsibility for suffering squarely on the sufferer's own shoulders.
* The true purpose of repentance is not scrubbing away karmic residue but recognizing one's own willful constructions as the source of afflictive patterns that bind all beings to delusion. 




## The Chanhui Wen

* The text begins with an analysis of the *Chanhui wen* inscription found at Dazhusheng cave.
* It identifies the scriptural sources used in the inscription, including the *Jueding pini jing*.
* The inscription is described as a confessional and repentance liturgy.
* The practitioner confesses offenses committed in this and previous lifetimes.

## Homage to Buddhas

* This section lists various categories of buddhas to whom homage is paid in the inscription.
* These include buddhas from different directions, past lives, and kalpas.

## Confession and Repentance

* This section details the structure of the confession and repentance portion of the liturgy.
* The practitioner expresses remorse for transgressions committed knowingly or unknowingly.
* They invoke the compassion of the buddhas to remember them and forgive their sins.
* Merit transfer and collective refuge are also included in this part.

## Buddha-Names and Liturgical Framework

* This section discusses the significance of the buddha-names listed in the inscription.
* It explains that these names represent different aspects of Buddhist cosmology and soteriology.
* The "Seven Roster Buddhanāma" framework is introduced, which categorizes buddhas into seven registers.


## Contextualizing the Space

* This section explores the physical context of the Dazhusheng cave and its surrounding area.
* It describes the terrace in front of the cave that could accommodate practitioners.
* The possibility of chanting rituals and bodhisattva precepts ceremonies is suggested.
* The inscription is interpreted as a script for practice to be performed *in situ*.

# Chapter Three Repentance Practices

* Dazhusheng cave echoes a larger project at Northern Xiangtangshan caves.
* The cave walls feature inscriptions including the *Śrīmālādevī-sūtra*.
* Pillars in front of the porch may have included names of buddhas from the *Foming jing* and *Jueding pini jing*.

# Bahui Temple

* Bahui temple in Quyang incorporates the *Jueding pini jing*.
* A sūtra-engraved niche (593-607) contains portions of seven texts, including buddha names from the *Guan Yaowang Yaoshang* er *pusa jing*, *Jueding pini jing*, and *Foming jing*.

# Fenglongshan Cave

* Fenglongshan cave near Ye monastery has three main niches with Vairocana, Amitābha, and Maitreya.
* It also features smaller niches with the thirty-five buddhas from the *Jueding pini jing*.
* Both Fenglongshan and Dazhusheng may have served as chambers for individual retreats to recite buddha-names and confession liturgies.

# The Jueding Pini Jing

* The *Jueding pini jing* describes a ritual practiced in isolation while visualizing the thirty-five buddhas of confession.
* This visualization leads to purification, confirmed by the appearance of the buddhas.
* The text emphasizes the relationship between aspiring and advanced bodhisattvas.

# Dazhusheng Cave's Purpose

* Dazhusheng cave aimed to touch the bodies of those who entered it.
* It evoked images of Dharma decline to inspire pure conduct in visitors.
* The cave linked practitioners to the "knowledge of the natures of things" through buddha-names and images.





## Widening The Circles Of Repentance

* Explores the concept of "differential complementarity" between other-power and self-power in Baoshan's teachings, comparing it to the Christian concepts of grace and works. 
* Discusses how Dilun soteriology, Sanjie, and Chan all utilize the tension between self-transformation and reliance on external salvific powers.

## The Agency Of Relations

* Examines specific forms of interactive work in liberation and self-transmutation.
* Highlights related activations of "other" and "self" in Dilun, Sanjie, and Chan soteriologies.

##  Dilun Repentance Soteriology And Its Responses

* Analyzes Dilun repentance practices and their influence on subsequent movements like Sanjie and Chan.
* Explains how these movements utilized the tension between self-transforming disciplines and reliance on external salvific powers.


## Comparing Dilun, Sanjie, And Chan

* Compares Dilun, Sanjie, and Chan variations on themes of final age/true Dharma, repentance/reflection, and buddha naming/becoming.
* Presents writings on repentance by Lingyu and Tanqian (Dilun disciples).
* Discusses the Sanjie movement's repentance-centered devotional program and its connection to practices at Baoshan.

## Repentance And Chan Soteriology

* Examines early Chan literature's reinterpretations or rejections of repentance practice.
* Suggests that sixth-century repentance practice remained embedded in eighth-century Chan soteriology through its scapegoating of repentance.
* Discusses the resurgence of this dynamic in the twelfth century "silent illumination" versus "examining the topic" polemic.

##  Confessional Practices In Modern Contexts

* Extends the discussion into modern contexts through parallel histories of confessional practices and their translation into psychological and therapeutic modes. 


## Dilun Repentance Verses

* Repentance formulae and bodhisattva precepts vows were believed to activate the merit-generating power of commitment to the bodhisattva path.
* Acknowledging one's past negative actions and praying to the buddhas for help in removing karmic residue was considered an important initial "purification" stage.
* This gained critical importance in Dilun soteriology because repentance could penetrate the deepest levels of the karmic continuum, giving access to buddha-nature.

## Repentance and Liberation

* Bruce Williams argues that Dilun monks believed repentance rituals not only renewed bodhisattva vows and removed karma but also eliminated entrenched afflictive patterns (*kleśa*) conditioning present and future actions.
* This radical claim meant that repentance itself could effect liberation.
* The *Guanfo sanmei hai jing* recommends repeated purification through repentance to achieve a lucid vision of the marks of the buddhas.

## Rationalizing Repentance

* Exegetes sought to rationalize this understanding of repentance in terms of *Prajñāpāramitā*-based emptiness discourse.
* The *Jin'gang xian lun* commentary proposes a simplified model of two complementary ultimate and provisional aspects of the truth-body of buddhas: the *dharmakāya* of dharma-nature and the *dharmakāya* of expediency.

## Lingyu's Repentance Poem

* Lingyu's poem highlights chaotic emotions and willful actions as the source of an afflictive or hellish experience of reality.
* It provides a step-by-step explanation of the spiritual physics of repentance: sincere repentance reveals transgressions, triggering the responsive compassion of the buddhas to eliminate *kleśas*.

## Confession and Buddha-Nature

* "Southern Branch" Dilun monks were interested in scriptures on *tathāgatagarba* ("buddha-matrix") and Paramārtha's Yogācāra commentaries theorizing two fundamental consciousnesses: *ālayavijñāna* (storehouse) and *amalavijñāna* (pure).
* Confession and repentance to expose defilements were key practices, as dissolving negative karmic patterns reproduced by the *ālayavijñāna* allowed one's buddha-nature and the *amalavijñāna* to be actualized.

## Repentance Poems of Lingyu and Tanqian

* Williams suggests that Lingyu and Tanqian's repentance poems were intended to supplement or substitute for formal liturgies.
* Lingyu's poem uses images of psycho-physical processes: transgressions are revealed in the mirror of self-disclosure/buddha-gaze, *kleśas* disappear through the catalytic effect of buddha-compassion.

* Tanqian's poem uses an image of alchemical transformation to express the instantaneous effect of repentance: confessing and repenting extirpates transgressions like a pearl purifying turbid water.
* For both Lingyu and Tanqian, confession enables the resonant response/identity between buddhas and buddha-nature, initiating fundamental change.

## Repentance In Related Soteriological Movements

* Repentance practices were common across various Buddhist movements, including Pure Land and Tiantai.
* These practices emphasized recognizing the flawed nature of the world and oneself.
* They aimed to activate ultimate and expedient *dharmakāya* through self-reflection and devotional acts.

## The Development of Simplified Repentance Practices

* By the seventh century, repentance became a fundamental Buddhist practice in China.
* Complex confession and visualization practices were accompanied by simpler collective devotions.
* These simplified forms allowed individuals to access merit fields and potential rebirth in Pure Lands.

## The Vajrasamādhi-sūtra's Approach to Repentance

* This text offered a middle ground between complex and simplified repentance practices.
* It emphasized contemplation practice based on *tathāgatagarbha* teachings while acknowledging devotional soteriology.
* Repentance was presented as a means to access clarity and coolness, dispelling the darkness of past deeds.

## Repentance and the Activation of Buddha-Nature

* The *Vajrasamādhi* highlighted the connection between repentance, reliance on buddha-words, and faith in *tathāgatagarbha*.
* Repentance was seen as a key to activating the resonance between refuge and realization.
* This concept is further explored in the context of Sanjie practice, where acknowledging one's evil nature plays a crucial role. 




## Resonances Between Sanjie Practices And Baoshan

* The Sanjie movement, active until the ninth century, shared similarities with Dazhusheng practices.
* Both emphasized repentance rituals and practices suitable for beings of inferior capacity in the final age.
* Xinxing, the founder of Sanjie, utilized Candragarbha's periodization and advocated offerings to erring monks.

## Three Levels and Inexhaustible Treasury

* "Three Levels" refers to spiritual capacities: superior, middling, and debased.
* Sanjie claimed humans in the current age were on the lowest level and could only benefit from universal teachings.
* Effective practice involved acknowledging evil within oneself and universal reverence for the incipient buddhahood of others.
* The "inexhaustible treasury" concretized the Avataṃsaka-sūtra's image of a vast merit field compounded by bodhisattvas' merit transfer.

## Xinxing's Practices and Legacy

* Xinxing preached that access to the inexhaustible merit field was achieved through universal non-discriminatory giving.
* He circumambulated buddha-image stūpas, highlighting his devotion.
* There is speculation about Xinxing abandoning precepts, but Daoxuan emphasizes his ascetic rigor after disrobing.

## Similarities with Pure Land Devotion

* Both Sanjie and Pure Land devotional orientation emerged during a time of anxiety about practice efficacy.
* They used texts to emphasize repentant self-reflection attracting buddha's attention.
* Both acknowledged world corruption and emphasized simplified practices for degenerate times.
* Sanjie promoted donation as the most effective practice, while Pure Land advocated reciting Amitābha's name.

## Sanjie Community and Practicescapes

* Sanjie clergy sought to create separate spaces for practice due to their perceived unworthiness.
* They were the first known movement in China to attempt cloisters exclusively for their practitioners.
* Like Baoshan, they created devotional spaces bringing together texts and images supporting their practice.

## Jinchuanwan Cave: A Sanjie Site

* Jinchuanwan cave displays elements marking it as a Sanjie site while echoing Dazhusheng's buddha-name liturgy.
* The main image is Śākyamuni, with extensive liturgical and scriptural texts engraved on the walls.
* Texts include Xinxing's works, Candragarbha-*sūtra*, *Shilun jing*, and others.

## Correspondences with Dazhusheng

* The *Qijie foming jing* at Jinchuanwan closely corresponds to Dazhusheng's *Chanhui wen*.
* Both include offerings, refuge in the Three Treasures, invocation of buddha-groups and individual buddhas.
* They share elements like repentance formulas from the *Jueding pini jing*.

##  Sanjie Practices and Imperial Proscriptions

* The Sanjie movement emphasized repentance practices, as seen in texts like Xinxing's *Qijie foming jing* and the *Zhouye liushi fayuan fa*. 
* These texts outline a structured regimen of buddha-name recitation throughout the day.
*  Sanjie identity was more overt at Jinchuanwan cave, which housed Xinxing's teachings and writings.

## Imperial Suppression of Sanjie

* Sanjie texts and practices were banned five times by imperial edict between 600 and 725 CE.
* Jamie Hubbard suggests that Xinxing's doctrine of the inferior discriminating capacity of beings in the final age may have been perceived as a challenge to imperial authority.
* The first ban in 600 CE was likely due to the political connections of Sanjie patron Gao Jiong, who fell out of favor with Empress Wenxian.

##  Repentance Practices And Chan


* Both Sanjie and early Chan were influenced by Dilun forerunners and shared a focus on repentance-centered soteriology.
* Chan may have usurped the field of practice dominated by repentance, leading to its criticisms of repentance, cleansing of *kleśas*, and seeking signs of buddha-response.
* The author argues that Chan's "formless practice" of *wunian* (no-thought) retained roots in *nian* as "buddha-recollection."

* Eighth-century Chan works emphasized the subitist nature of all practices, claiming that true repentance is realizing no-repentance.
* Both Lingyu's buddha-reflection through repentance and Chan's reflexive non-reification of buddha-nature aimed at realization of original nonduality.
* As this reflexive devotional soteriology was interiorized, earlier practices on which it depended were scapegoated, allowing Chan to establish its own space.

## - Scapegoating Repentance In Eighth-Century Chan

* This section explores how early Chan practitioners adapted and reformed bodhisattva precepts ceremonies and repentance formulae.
* Tiantai Zhiyi's work is seen as a formative influence on Chan ideology, with Chan appropriating the highest level of his teachings ("perfect and sudden") while rejecting foundational levels.
* Zhiyi articulated three mutually-reinforcing acts in the repentance ritual: acknowledging sins, seeking miraculous signs, and meditating on the empty nature of sins.

## -  Professionalization of Repentance Rituals

* In the eighth century, bodhisattva precepts rituals became increasingly specialized, used for attaining good luck or during funerals and building dedications.
* This specialization contributed to a polarization between ritual and contemplative practice, though previously they were considered complementary.

## - Antinomian Rhetoric and Repentance

* While repentance liturgies continued to develop, antinomian rhetoric emphasizing the nonexistence of defilements in realization of true mind began to establish its own oppositional trajectory.
* The coexistence of repentance ritual texts and early Chan texts in the Dunhuang cache indicates their shared importance in that practice community.

## - Shenxiu's Teachings on Repentance

* Shenxiu's *Dasheng wusheng fangbian men* opens with a collective precepts ritual but ultimately argues that both conventional and ultimate meanings of the precepts are retained.

## - Shenhui's Critique of Purification Practices

* Shenhui criticized all practices aimed at purification, claiming they contributed to misrecognition of the nature of the mind.
* True practice was redefined as the non-objectification of practice, with any accommodation of conventional practice becoming problematic.

## - The Platform Sutra and Repentance

* The *Platform Sūtra* reinterprets stages of a bodhisattva precepts ceremony as aspects of taking the "formless precepts," including repentance.
* Repentance is defined as not doing evil, a shorthand for the first of the Three Pure Precepts based on the *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*.

## - Wuzhu's Rejection of Ritualistic Repentance

* The *Lidai fabao ji* presents Wuzhu's thoroughgoing Chan rejection of repentance.
* He calls fellow disciples raving idiots for wanting to practice daily periods of worship and repentance.

## - Huike, Sengcan, and the Pivot of Repentance

* The *Baolin zhuan* pinpoints repentance as the pivot of the exchange between Huike and Sengcan.
* When Sengcan asks Huike to administer repentance rites, Huike declares he has done so even though Sengcan cannot present his transgression.


## -  No-Thought and the Absence of Transgression

* In dialogues in *Record II*, the *Baolin zhuan*, and the *Jingde chuandeng lu*, Huike interrogates the indeterminability of transgressions and the "self" who committed them.
* These episodes give flesh to Chan antinomian claims based on Yogācāra doctrine: the discriminatory function of mind that produces characteristics is the illusory locus of transgression.

## - The Battle of Verses and the Mirror-Mind Metaphor

* The famous battle of verses between Shenxiu and Huineng in the *Liuzu tanjing* uses the mirror-mind metaphor to reject practices aimed at purifying the mind of "dust," *kleśa*.
* Shenxiu's verse emphasizes polishing the mind like a mirror, while Huineng's response rejects this notion.

## Doubt And The Chan "Theodicy" Problem

* This section explores the sixth-century Chan tradition and its challenge to repentance practices involving confessing *kleśas*.
* It highlights the Chan master's role as the recipient of the devotee's mind, dismantling the notion of a separate "other" for achieving enlightenment.
* The discussion draws parallels between early Chan teachings and later Song dynasty developments in silent illumination (*mozhao*) and examining the topic (*kanhua*) practices.

## Modern Confessional Complexes

* This section examines the concept of confession in a modern context, drawing on academic disciplines like anthropology, sociology, history, literature, and psychology.
* It acknowledges the influence of Foucault's work on confession and its impact on historical analysis.
* The section highlights the differences between Buddhist ritual confession and Western models of confession, emphasizing the broader scope of sins covered in Buddhist traditions.




## "Ajase"

* **Introduction:**
    * This account explores Michael Radich's study on the story of Prince Ajātaśatru, examining its various iterations across Asian cultures and its psychological implications.
    * Radich connects the development of morally ambiguous characters in Japanese drama to a unique Japanese psychoanalytic theory called the "Ajase complex."

* **Prince Ajātaśatru:**
    * Ajātaśatru is a prominent figure in Buddhist tales, known for his karmic consequences.
    * The narrative involves him imprisoning and starving his father, King Bimbisāra, due to evil counsel, but later experiencing remorse and seeking redemption through the Buddha.

* **Variations and Significance:**
    * Radich highlights the versatility of the Ajātaśatru story across different Buddhist sources, from Pāli canon to Mahāyāna texts.
    * The *Nirvāṇa sūtra* and *Guan wuliangshou fo jing* introduce significant variations, emphasizing Queen Vaidehī's role and themes of salvation through contemplation.

* **Chinese Reception:**
    * Chinese versions of the story reflect ambivalence towards legitimizing imperial accession through violence.
    * Themes like filial piety, decline discourse, confession, and repentance are prominent in these narratives.

* **Japanese Psychoanalytic Theory:**
    * Radich traces the development of the "Ajase complex" in Japan, influenced by Kosawa Heisaku and Okonogi Keigo.
    * This theory presents a unique understanding of guilt, focusing on the child's debt to the self-sacrificing parent, with Queen Vaidehī playing a central role.

* **Reflections and Questions:**
    * Radich concludes by raising important questions about cultural appropriation, universalism versus relativism, and the relevance of historical studies in contemporary contexts.
    * He advocates for a cautious yet open approach to comparative analysis, acknowledging both the limitations and possibilities of understanding cross-cultural patterns.

* **Confession and Repentance:**
    * Radich's work prompts reflection on the universality or comparability of confession and repentance across cultures and time periods.
    * The author suggests that while a complete understanding of past practices may be elusive, we can still engage with them meaningfully and draw connections to contemporary experiences.

## Foucault And Technologies Of Self

* Confession is a key theme in *The History of Sexuality* and throughout Foucault's writings on language politics and "technologies of the self."
* Buddhist preoccupation with repentance rituals eliminating karmic effects contrasts with Foucault's psychoanalytic confession, but both see the roots of afflictive experience as elusive.
* Both Buddhist (especially Yogācāric) and psychoanalytic modes developed techniques to enhance awareness of subliminal causal dynamics shaping the "self" experience.

## Buddhist Attitudes To Volitional Conceptualization

* In Buddhist soteriological project, volitional conceptualization is endowed with inexhaustible and polymorphous causal power, similar to Foucault's view on sexuality.
* Desire and conception are constructs evoking both, rooted in the Buddhist teaching that *saṃskāras* (constructing activities) generate desire-driven thoughts and actions.

## Confession And The Modern Subject

* Foucault connects confession to the creation of the modern subject, noting the Reformation's shift from priestly confession to private prayer and an unmediated relationship with God.
* Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* was conceived as liberation, but confession remained a revealer and congealer of potent latencies, even in disembodied social media interactions.

## Dazhusheng Cave Practices

* Confessing and repenting to buddhas at Dazhusheng cave invokes salvific expedients while the nearby *Wuchang ji* verses glorify nirvāṇa through inversions of ordinary experience.
* These practices are complementary opposites: confessing consequential acts and rejoicing in their emptiness, enacting the inversion desired by Dilun and Chan practitioners.

## Defiled Nature And Buddha-Nature

* Baoshan's practicescape includes references to defiled nature, but it is conditioned through volitional conceptualization, provisionally effective and ultimately empty like the buddhas evoked.
* The devotee is seen as buddha, damned only insofar as her vision is self-eluded. 




## Conclusions

* The Mahāmāyā-*sūtra* passage and Chanhui wen provide scripts for repentance that turn volitional thought back on itself, enabling practitioners to directly address the buddhas with the prayer "recollect me."

* Dazhusheng cave served as a stage for the cyclic universal drama of the possibility of perfection even in the darkening days of the final age.
* Lay support of the *saṃgha*, coupled with whole-hearted acknowledgement of one's own corrupted condition, earned heroic status and even buddhahood. 

* Recognizing the evil of one's nature was not a soteriology of self-hatred but a path to ultimate apotheosis through acceptance of difficult truths.
* The signature Sanjie practice of recognizing the evil of one's nature empowered practitioners by acknowledging their ability to see the *dharmakāya*.

## Chapter Four The Agency Of Relations

* This chapter focuses on the work involved in maintaining and reproducing relations among human and nonhuman participants at Baoshan, including buddhas, bodhisattvas, objects, edifices, and deceased community members.
* "Practicescape" refers to skillful work that maintains self-reproducing relations through the changes they generate.

* The chapter explores different kinds of work: reproducing and gaining access to the merit-field, transmuting deceased members into effective mediators, women's work and its impact on place and practice, and the work of mourning.
* It proposes shifting focus from the agency of actors versus things to the "agency of relations," where constructions (textual, visual, reflexive) emerge from processes of intention and action and have efficacy within those processes.

* The chapter draws inspiration from Buddhist teachings that experience of self and objects are effects of aggregated processes rather than properties of things-in-themselves.
* It examines three domains of work: the work of merit and maintenance of spiritual treasuries, the performative work of writing to actualize vows and precepts, and the agency of resonance created through representation in a Baoshan niche.

## The Work Of Merit

* The notion of merit (*gongde*, Skt. *puṇya*) has always been crucial in Buddhist devotional activity. Offerings to the Buddha and *saṃgha* gain merit for the devotee, which helps offset negative karma and create favorable future conditions.
* In traditional Buddhism, becoming a monk was the most meritorious act. 
* In Mahāyāna contexts, working on the perfection (*pāramitā*) of merit-generating generosity (*dāna*) was one of the preparatory practices of the bodhisattva path.
* For laypeople, supporting the community of monks and nuns was the most important way to gain merit.

## The Foundations Of Merit-Practice

* The *Dakkhiṇāvibhanga Sutta* discusses the tension between personal ties and liberation in the context of gift-giving. 
* The Buddha argues that gifts to the collective *saṃgha* have greater merit than gifts to individuals, even a Tathāgata.
* While Buddhist rhetoric emphasizes the impersonal nature of merit, it is not always deployed altruistically.
* Some Pāli scriptures suggest that the individual dispositions of both donor and recipient determine the efficacy of the gift.

* The idea of "transferring" merit raises ontological problems in Buddhism because there is no substance to transfer.
* Chinese Buddhists developed textual and ritual processes to reconcile faith in merit-transfer with the understanding of its lack of inherent essence.
* Dilun works reflect a concern with reconciling merit and emptiness, seeing it as another form of the self/other dialectic.



# Merit And Merit-Transfer In A Chinese Commentary

* The text explains concepts of merit and merit-transfer using the *Dasheng yizhang*, a compendium of Mahāyāna doctrines attributed to Huiyuan (523-592).
* Huiyuan categorized Mahāyāna doctrines based on principles like numerical groups and the structure of the bodhisattva path.

# The Dasheng Yizhang

* The *Dasheng yizhang* may have been compiled by Huixiu (547-646) and polished by Huiyuan, both prominent Dilun masters active in Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, and Sui dynasties.
* This text provides insight into how concepts of merit and merit-transfer were understood among the Baoshan clergy.

# Merit And Merit Transfer In The Fourteenth Fascicle

* The fourteenth fascicle presents ten items outlining doctrinal tenets related to merit and merit-transfer.
* It defines *gongde* (merit) as the power that enables beings to attain nirvāṇa through practice of virtues (*de*), equated with the pāramitās cultivated by bodhisattvas.
* Ten kinds of merit are listed, including: entrance to wisdom, arising of powers, immeasurable compassion, ten benefits and results, five rewards, unobstructed mind, cultivation as treatment for existence, prescriptions for successful treatment, correct path of cultivation, culmination of the correct path.

# Merit Transfer

* The section on merit-transfer (*huixiang*) explains its ten kinds, citing the *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*.
* It defines *huixiang* as returning or reversing direction towards nirvāṇa.
* Ten designations of merit-transfer are listed, including: delivering beings from rebirth tendency, incorruptible faith, universal efficacy of merit transfer, inexhaustible merit treasury.

# Significance


* The concept of an "inexhaustible merit store" (*wujin gongde zang*) is highlighted as a key element in the *Dasheng yizhang*.
* This notion was central to Three Levels soteriology, which emphasized universal nondiscriminatory giving as the most effective practice for karmically burdened practitioners.

# Ten Designations of Merit-Transfer

*  Merit transfer involves ten facets.
* These facets include establishing good roots, benefiting all beings, grounding in ultimate reality, non-attachment, and the immeasurable merit of the *dharmadhātu*.

# Two Categories of Efficacy

* Merit transfer is categorized into three types: resulting from the good roots of beings and bodhisattvas, and the good *dharma* of ultimate reality.
* The text emphasizes a hierarchical hermeneutic, highlighting that the true benefit of merit practice is direct realization of ultimate truth.

# Two Kinds of Adornment

* Merit and wisdom are presented as two kinds of adornment.
* Merit (*fude* or *gongde*) enhances the welfare of the practitioner, while wisdom (*zhihui*) represents knowledge and apprehension of ultimate truth.

# Essence and Function

* Essence refers to verifying nirvāṇa, while function refers to worldly benefits derived from merit.
* The text contrasts the impermanent nature of merit with the enduring nature of wisdom.

# Three Categories of Merit-Transfer

* Merit-transfer is divided into three categories: *bodhi*, beings, and reality.
* Each category serves a specific purpose in aiding the practitioner's progress towards enlightenment.


# Validation for Family Benefit

* The text addresses concerns about the efficacy of merit transfer for benefiting one's family.
* It emphasizes that merit transfer enables the conversion of family members through mutual aid and the inexhaustible storehouse of merit.

# Buddhist "Physics" of Pure Lands

* The *Dasheng yizhang* explains the composition of Pure Lands as a co-constitutive relationship between body, intention, and field.
* This concept highlights the interplay of individual agency and the grace of buddhas and bodhisattvas in achieving enlightenment.





## Generosity And "The Gift" Of The Three Treasures

* This section focuses on the transactional work enabled by the circulation of reproductions of the Buddha, his words, and his disciples.
* Andy Rotman argues that in early Buddhist narrative literature, the Three Treasures were the media that enabled interpenetration of spiritual and mundane economies. 
* He characterizes this multidimensional economy as follows: seeing, believing, giving, and buying work together to constitute the ethical field of Buddhism.

## The Gift And The Circulation Of The Three Treasures

* This section examines the notion of "the gift" (related to *prasāda*) as a mode of circulating the Three Treasures.
* Carvings at Dazhusheng cave depict the Buddha's inconceivable form and powers, the Dharma's inexhaustible salvific activity, and the *saṃgha* as a purified sea of merit.

## The Ambiguity Of The Saṃgha As A Merit-Field

* Depictions of the twenty-four Dharma-transmitting masters represent a kind of super-*saṃgha* designated as "holy"—but they are no longer accessible.
* In contrast, depictions of erring monks represent the *saṃgha* merit-field, suggesting an unintentional ambiguity enshrined therein.

## True Treasures And Provisional Traces

* Koichi Shinohara discusses a passage in Daoshi's *Zhujing yaoji* that differentiates between the true (*zhen*) Treasures and their provisional traces.
* Daoshi presents the view that because the true Treasures are no longer directly accessible, it is only provisional traces that can be worshipped.

## Diversification And Hedging Bets In The Economy Of Merit

* In the sixth and seventh centuries we see proliferation of means of making offerings and accessing the Three Treasures.
* These means included rituals, images, edifices, and exegesis, transmitted in media of varying degrees of durability, portability, and expense.
* Shifting hierarchies among salvific figures, the rise and fall of devotional cults, inter-referential substitutions, and variations on the ideology of karma and merit sustained a complex circulation of transactions.

## The Three Treasuries As Mutually Reinforcing Entities

* The "sites of investment" were the Three Treasures in their function as treasuries.
* These treasuries were mutually reinforcing yet also mediated concerns about hierarchies of agency and value.

## The Saṃgha's Role In Regulating Values

* The third treasury, the *saṃgha*, was invested with the authority to regulate these fluctuating values.
* However, they were also "insiders" who could potentially profit the most (and be most corrupted) by these transactions.

## Donors And Beneficiaries: Blurred Lines

* When considering the institutional and individual dispositions that contribute to the creation of Buddhist wealth, it is important to keep in mind that there is no clear line that divides donors and beneficiaries.
* Donors were (and still are) just as likely to be monks or nuns.

## The Impersonal Reward Of Merit

* Theoretically, the Buddhist gift (offering) and its impersonal reward, merit, circulate in a system consisting entirely of individual donors and no individual recipients or reciprocators.

## The Sociological Perspective On Buddhist Giving

* However, from a sociological perspective, the desire to uphold laws of obligation and securitize debts in complex systems is considered one of the driving forces of social organization.
* In this critical light, the Buddhist ideal of selfless giving can be seen as a mask that softens the features of power differentials.

## Mauss's The Gift: Agency Of Social Relations

* This section focuses on Marcel Mauss's *The Gift* (*Essai sur le don*) and its foundational work on the agency of social relations.
* Mauss's inquiry into the ways that special objects (including texts) and ideas (including objectified constructs) are imbued with charisma and transactional agency is explored.

## The Personal And The Collective In Gift-Giving

* Studies of traditional gift-giving practices show that the quality of "the personal" is often marked as both necessary and dangerous to sustainable functioning of the circuit of giving.
* This ambivalence is integral to the system.

## Mauss's Conundrum Of Free And Obligatory Exchange

* Mauss's work revolves around the conundrum of free and obligatory exchange, on the power by which things circulate through "total" or undifferentiated social phenomena that constitute so-called "primitive" societies.
* His work has come to symbolize his simplest proposition, namely that what goes by the name of gift is really exchange.

## The Power In The Object: A Reexamination

* Mauss's evocation of a "power in the object" (exemplified by the Maori hau) that impersonally impels reciprocity was criticized by Claude Lévi Strauss as recourse to mystification and uncooked indigenous theory.
* Nevertheless, let us reexamine Mauss's intuition that "souls are mixed with things; things with souls" in an incalculable social, economic, and sacred flux of exchange.

## Merit: Perpetual Increase Of The Good

* In a Buddhist rendering of this economy, the spiritual ties binding gifts and merit yield personal benefits, especially afterlife salvation, for oneself and one's loved ones.
* The *saṃgha*, on the other side of the coin, is reified as a universal impersonal field of offerings enabling donors to cultivate the seeds of merit.

## Double Vision: Balanced And Weighted Credit And Debt

* "Merit" represents the ideal of perpetual increase of the good (and goods) through circulation.
* The challenge for the scholar of sacred objects and sacred rhetoric is to see with a kind of double vision both the ideally-balanced and the personally-weighted credit and debt that keep the Three Treasures of Buddha, Dharma, and *saṃgha* in circulation.

## The Work Of W/Riting And Vows

* Meritorious offering is inseparable from ritual performance.
* This section discusses representations of writing in mortuary images at Baoshan and their possible correspondences with injunctions about practice found in Dazhusheng's source-text, the Jueding pini jing. 
* It also considers the centrality of vows for all forms of practice in this milieu.

## W/Riting And The Bodies Of The Merit Field

* Valuable work has emerged on the ritual uses of writing in Chinese Buddhist practice.
* David Keightley elucidates the performative roots of writing in the earliest traces of Chinese civilization, suggesting ways that dispositions of the dead and their goods communicated across barriers of time and materiality. 
* In Daoist ritual, mastery of sacred graphs was demanded. Writing conveyed offerings and petitions to transcendent beings.

* In Buddhist contexts, the performative work of writing centered on Mahāyāna promotion of copying, reciting, and worshipping sūtras.
* David McMahan argues that the shift from the aural/oral focus of early Buddhist teachings toward the lavishly "visual turn" of the Mahāyāna scriptures should be understood in the context of the spread of literacy in India.

* Baoshan's mortuary niches are special hybrids that incorporate Chinese mortuary practices to produce unique forms.
* Representations of writing in these niches provide a semiotics of the community that produced them.

* The field of representations of w/riting at Baoshan could be considered a practicescape where continual reenactments and alterations of a logic of practice distinguish the functions and privileges of members of a given group.
* A host of details, including dress and architectural forms, reinforce and nuance information about the status of the deceased within the field of relations.

## Vows




# Some Laywomen in Baoshan

* Depicted with joined palms, representing confession and repentance before buddha images or refuge in the Three Treasures.
* Although occupying the lowest rung of the fourfold *saṃgha*, there is a touching personal intimacy conveyed in some of the inscriptions and placements.
* Many laywomen are identified as mothers of nuns, their afterlife housings may be closely adjacent to those of their high-status Dharma daughters.

# W/Riting In The Jueding Pini Jing

*  The Baoshan community's touchstone practice text, prescribes hierarchical levels of practices that admit practitioners into the company of the great bodhisattvas.
* Aspiring bodhisattvas are separated into two groups according to their manner of giving: lay practitioners and ordained.
* The text links these groups in donation of the Dharma but differentiates the means. 
* It contrasts these meritorious practices with offenses, stating that offenses can be extirpated by public confession or private repentance.

# Accessing The Agency Of Relations Through Vows

* For both monastics and laypersons, taking vows to maintain precepts appropriate to one's condition was a definitive threshold.
* In China, a roster of special days for vows and devotions was essential to the maintenance of individual and community practice.
* These rituals involved fasting and devotion, with lay devotees abstaining from various activities for a full day and night.



# The Work Of Mutual Responsiveness

* Devotees' efforts were directed toward activating/accessing beneficial relations.
* Generating and transferring merit enacted a field of connections for practitioners.
* Offerings to the Three Treasures maintained a triple-refuge whose human representatives, the clergy, were the most familiar but also the most fallible.
* Copying sūtras became a ritual of meritorious offering.
* Fasts accompanied by chanted vows and repentances brought the practitioner before the penetrating and purifying gaze of the assembly.

# How then might we conceive of the relationship between living practitioners and the representations of the deceased who appear in Baoshan's mortuary constructions? 




## Resonance Between The Living And The Dead

* This section introduces the concept of responsive resonance in medieval Chinese culture through inscriptions found in a mortuary grove.
* It focuses on two stūpas dedicated to Dharma Masters Huijing and Huixiu, highlighting their unique location and possible connection to Cirun monastery. 

## Huijing's Memorial and Fayan's Mourning

* This section explores Huijing's memorial inscription, which reveals a personal crisis that led him to shift his focus from study to restoration work.
* It examines Fayan's eulogy for Huijing, emphasizing his desire for continued connection with his deceased master through an audience with his *shenyi*. 
* The text delves into the meaning of *shenyi*, exploring its multifaceted nature as a superstantial appearance or image, and its potential connection to ancestor veneration.

## Shen, Gui, and the Aesthetics of Resonance

* This section analyzes the concept of *shen* (spirit) in early Chinese thought, distinguishing it from *gui* (malevolent spirits).
* It discusses the debate surrounding the independence of *shen* from physical form (*xing*) and its connection to aesthetic theory.
* The text explores the notion of *qiyun shengdong* as an aesthetic ideal that links image/appearance with transcendence, emphasizing the importance of capturing or perceiving *qiyun* or *shen* in art.

## Sympathetic Resonance and Correlation

* This section introduces the concept of sympathetic resonance (*ganying*) as a fundamental principle governing the interaction between things in the world.
* It highlights the belief that this resonance connects Heaven and earth, suggesting a metaphysical framework for understanding the relationship between the living and the dead. 




# Dong Zhongshu and the Concept of Resonance

* Dong Zhongshu is often credited with a system of correlations based on the principle of "like resonates with like."
* This concept was explained using metaphors of sound and tuning, emphasizing the interconnectedness of phenomena.
* Later theories expanded on this idea, linking it to metaphysical concepts like principle (li) and phenomena (shi), substance (ti) and function (yong).

# Chinese Buddhist Merit and Resonance

* The Buddhist concept of merit (*gongde*) aligns with Chinese ideas of virtue as a medium of sympathetic resonance.
* *Gongde* incorporates the ancient term "de," representing the power of virtue, which operates through the character of the Sage.
* These concepts highlight the importance of relationships and interconnectedness in understanding how things work in the world.

# Ritual Dynamics and Resonantal Interaction

* Chinese Buddhist rituals often follow a tripartite structure: enabling impetus (*jiyuan*), stimulus (*gan*), and response (*ying*).
* This structure emphasizes the mutual exchange and resonantal interaction between participants and the sacred object of devotion.
* Ritual gestures (yi and fa) are seen as crucial in forging this connection and eliciting a response.

# Resonance Beyond Ritual

* The principle of resonance extends beyond ritual practices to encompass various aspects of life, including subtle energies (qi), emotions, and communication.
* Stimulus does not reside solely in the object or action but arises from the mutually resonant virtues of interacting effects.
* Resonance can connect events separated in time, as seen in concepts like karmic ripeness and sympathetic understanding (*gantong* and *ganzheng*).




## Rhetorical Arts And Real Effects

* This section explores cross-cultural comparisons between Chinese aesthetics and Western aesthetics, specifically focusing on the concept of efficacy versus essence.
* It draws inspiration from François Jullien's work on Chinese aesthetics but acknowledges criticisms regarding potential Orientalist essentialization.
* The author focuses on the term *ekphrasis* and Plato's *The Sophist* to examine the efficacy of representations in both Chinese and Western contexts.

## Ekphrasis

*  Ekphrasis, originally a Greek rhetorical term, refers to vivid descriptions that evoke an image or visceral experience in the listener.
* It was believed to possess a magical power to absorb the audience into visualized contact with the subject.
* Examples of ekphrasis can be found in various cultures, including ancient India and China.

## The Sophist

* Plato's *The Sophist* challenges the traditional Platonic view of representation by questioning the relationship between forms and their copies.
* The Eleatic Stranger argues that the only reality of an image is its "unreality" and proposes that being is defined as power, or the ability to affect or be affected.
* This proposition, while initially appealing, ultimately fails to distinguish between immutable being and the fluctuations of becoming.

## Resonantal Aesthetics

* The author suggests that both ekphrasis and certain Buddhist concepts share a focus on the resonantal activation of things rather than mimesis or technical virtuosity.
* In Buddhism, representations are seen as "form that is no-form," highlighting their other-dependent nature and capacity to destabilize subject-object relations.



# Being and Non-Being

* The text proposes that being arises from the unity of opposites: active and passive, movement and rest.
* This unity is deemed inadmissible, leading to a third proposition: "communication of 'some with some'."
* This communication represents diverse yet ordered relationships, requiring dialectical analysis by philosophers.
* The Stranger in Plato's *Sophist* argues for the ability to see underlying forms connecting scattered multitudes and unifying wholes.
* This contradicts Parmenides' law, suggesting that not-being is a form of being distributed through relations.

# Under Madhyamaka Analysis

* Buddhist Madhyamaka dialectics use contradictions between being and non-being to demonstrate their dependent, notional nature.
* The text compares this to Chinese *xuanxue*, which explores the interpenetration of being and non-being.
* However, the text ultimately reclaims a stable dualism, attributing false arts to language's derivative medium where these concepts appear contradictory.

# Representation and Co-Constitution

* Madhyamaka analysis reveals the absence of source, essence, or self-moving mover in the correspondence and codependence of antitheses.
* This extends to aesthetics, suggesting that representation points to how conceptual distinctions create "X" rather than deriving from an ineffable X-ness.
* The being-versus-non-being of representations is a mental construct, regardless of whether they are objects or images.

# Agency of Relations

* The lack of independent essence and co-constitution of effect support the claim for mutual responsiveness between skillful means (buddhas) and provisional means (beings).
* This chapter explores doctrinal grounds of Dilun exegetes (*tathāgatagarbha* and Yogācāra theories) and how buddha-nature theories were formulated in Dilun paths of practice.

# Theories And Debates

* The section draws on Michel Serres' concept of "locally responsive and globally sub rosa" phenomena, comparing it to Proteus's metamorphoses.
* Each appearance is both illuminating and occulting, highlighting the dynamic interplay between revelation and concealment.

# Introduction

* The author acknowledges limitations as a non-specialist in Sanskrit and Tibetan philology but aims to analyze arguments made by scholars.
* The work explores Yogācāra exegetes' and practitioners' investigations into shifts in experiential orientation.
* The author adopts a hybrid approach, combining historical context with personal experience while recognizing the limitations of individual belief in academic argumentation.

# Path Constructions in Dilun Texts

* This section draws on Chen-kuo Lin's discussion of two Dunhuang manuscripts to explore practices relevant to Baoshan's milieu.
* It focuses on how Dilun texts construct paths for practitioners, highlighting the interplay between meditative absorption, study, and skillful engagement.




## Overviews Tathāgatagarbha

*  Tathāgatagarbha refers to the idea that all sentient beings possess the potential for buddhahood.
* Scholars debate the evolution and origins of this doctrine, with some arguing for its presence in early texts like the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra*.

## The Nirvāṇa-sūtra and Early Tathāgatagarbha Thought

*  The *Nirvāṇa-sūtra* contains passages that may be among the earliest expressions of *tathāgatagarbha* thought.
* Early forms of *tathāgatagarbha* saw it as an element contained within all beings, linked to the concept of a buddha-element (*buddhadhātu*).

## Development and Interpretations of Tathāgatagarbha

*  Subsequent texts presented varying interpretations of *tathāgatagarbha*, sometimes as an innate potential or as a fundamental reality.
* Chinese Buddhists translated *tathāgatagarbha* as *rulaizang* (buddha-womb) and later as *foxing* (buddha-nature).

## Key Texts on Tathāgatagarbha

*  Several texts explore *tathāgatagarbha*, including the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra*, *Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra*, *Mahāmegha-sūtra*, *Śrīmālādevī-sūtra*, and *Ratnagotravibhāga*.
* These texts use metaphors and philosophical concepts to explain the nature of *tathāgatagarbha* and its relationship to buddhahood.

## The *Dasheng qixin lun* and the Integration of Tathāgatagarbha with Yogācāra

*  The *Dasheng qixin lun*, a sixth-century Chinese text, attempted to reconcile *tathāgatagarbha* with Yogācāra thought.
* It emphasized the importance of practice in actualizing intrinsic enlightenment (*benjue*) through methods like meditation and buddha-worship.





## Yogācāra - Yogācāra And Baoshan

* **Yogācāra thought**
    * A busy sub-field in Buddhist studies with extensive Indian, Tibetan, and East Asian trajectories.
    * Accused of harboring covert substantialist or essentialist tendencies.
    * Scholars have demonstrated how Yogācāra has remained congruent with core Buddhist teachings.
* **Paramārtha's Shelun trend**
    * Posits a ninth consciousness of "intrinsically pure seeds" as the most profound level of the mind.
    * Interpreted and altered Yogācāra treatises to support his view of fundamentally pure mind.
    * Influenced "one mind" tendencies in early Chan.
* **Xuanzang's Weishi school**
    * Translated Yogācāra treatises with the express design of clarifying Chinese Yogācāra.
    * Followers became known as the Weishi (*Vijñaptimātra,* Consciousness-Only) school.
    * "Consciousness-only" should not be taken as an ontological claim that "everything is really consciousness."

* **Yogācāra at Baoshan**
    * Provides a particular place from which to view key Yogācāra debates.
    * Lingyu was allied with Ratnamati's interpretation of Vasubandhu's Daśabhūmikasūtra-śāstra.
    * Reflects a web of texts and sites in sixth- and seventh-century north China that show elements of a shared culture.

* **Hybrid Yogācāra-*tathāgatagarbha* interests**
    * Reflected in the principal translations of both branches of the Dilun trend.
    * The early Baoshan community appears to have been most interested in the phenomenology of correspondence between aspiring buddhas and actualized buddhas.



## - Summary Of Yogācāra Theory

* Influenced by *śūnyatā* ideas from Prajñāpāramitā literature, Yogācāra reworked earlier Buddhist theories.
* It addressed issues like memory, perception, karma, and individual responsibility, questioning the existence of persistent selves or *dharmas*.
* Yogācāra emphasizes disciplined cultivation (*yogā*) of cognitive processes through meditation (*dhyāna*)

## Early Forms and Key Figures

* Early forms appear in third-century Mahāyāna scriptures.
* Asaṅga and Vasubandhu are credited with formalizing it in fourth- to fifth-century northwest India.
* Seminal texts include the *Saṃdhinirmocana-*sūtra* and Asaṅga's *Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra*.

## Controversial Innovations

* The concept of *ālayavijñāna* ("storehouse consciousness") sparked debate.
* Critics saw it as potentially contradicting Buddhist teachings against permanent selves.
* Blending Yogācāra with *tathāgatagarbha* thought intensified this concern.

##  Yogācāra's Working Premise

* The perceived world is a cognitive construction, a "psychosophic closure."
* This closure involves imputing independent externality to things based on habitual patterns of perception.
* These subliminal processes shape sensory experience and perpetuate the illusion of self.

## Yogācāra Theories of Mental Functioning

* Built upon early Buddhist teachings of *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent origination) and the five *skandhas* (aggregates).
* Analyzes these concepts to reveal the lack of inherent "own nature" (*svabhāva*) in phenomena.
* Rejects theories that posit the own-nature of *dharmas*.

##  Basic Elements in Yogācāra Theory

* Elaborates on the five aggregates, particularly consciousness.
* Categorizes consciousness into eight functions: six sense-consciousnesses, *manas*, and *ālayavijñāna*.
* Explains how these interact to create the illusion of self and objects.

## The Five Aggregates

1) *Rūpa*: Form, sensed qualities that offer resistance to sensory capabilities.
2) *Vedanā*: Feelings (pleasure, pain, neutrality) arising from sensory contact.
3) *Saṁjñā*: Perceptions, recognition, association, and interpretation based on past experiences.
4) *Saṃskāra*: Constructing activities, karmically charged conditioning and volitional acts.

5) *Vijñāna*: Consciousness, the function of discriminating and cognizing through the senses.

# The Seventh Consciousness

*  The seventh consciousness (*manas*) is a "self-grasping" mind-sense that constantly appropriates the functioning of other consciousnesses.
* It makes experience meaningful by inferring from past experiences, creating a sense of subject and object.
* This subliminal process is not apparent, leading to a false sense of immediacy in experience.

# The Eighth Consciousness

* The eighth consciousness (*ālayavijñāna*) is the "storehouse consciousness" that stores karmic seeds (*bījā*).
* It reproduces these seeds, which determine future experiences based on past volitional actions.
* The *ālaya* accounts for continuity of experience even during sleep or death.

# Karmic Conditioning and Closure

* The Yogācāra view sees the appearance of continuity as a projection created by the *ālaya*.
* Seeds are resurrected each moment, shaping our experiences based on past actions.
* This creates a cycle of karmic conditioning and "closure," where perceptions reinforce existing patterns.

# Overcoming Karmic Conditioning

* Ignorance (*avidyā*) is seen as a gap in memory that prevents awareness of karmic conditioning.
* Mindfulness (*smṛti*) can help break this cycle by bringing awareness to present actions and their context.
* Through ethical conduct (*śīla*), meditation (*samādhi*), and wisdom (*prajñā*), the habitual patterns of consciousness can be reversed.

# Liberation and Bodhisattva Activity

* When karmic conditioning ceases, the *ālaya* transforms into "great mirror cognition," reflecting reality impartially.
* Liberated bodhisattvas can use skillful means (*upāya*) to interact with ordinary beings' projections and guide them towards liberation.

## Debates

* Discusses terminological battles within Yogācāra Buddhism, particularly regarding the nature of reality and consciousness.
* Explores the concept of *saṃvṛti* (conventional reality) and how language and consciousness contribute to its illusion of closure.
* Highlights the role of *mano-jalpa* (refutational mental activity) in disrupting the narcissism of the *ālaya-vijñāna* (storehouse consciousness).

## Entanglements Ii: Terminological Battles And The Contemporary Debate Over Yogācāra And Idealism

* Examines the debate surrounding whether Yogācāra can be classified as a form of idealism.
* Presents Lusthaus's argument against labeling Xuanzang as an idealist, emphasizing the focus on co-constitutive workings of conceptualization and experience in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
* Argues that the "idealism" versus "non-idealism" dichotomy is misleading and proposes a "soft idealism" approach that acknowledges the indeterminable nature of external reality.
* Emphasizes the importance of contemplative experiential investigations alongside theoretical debates in understanding Yogācāra.
* Suggests that Yogācāra soteriology, with its emphasis on buddha-response and karmic conditions, transcends simplistic categorizations derived from Western philosophical debates.

## - Dan Lusthaus And Rūpa

* Lusthaus argues that Yogācāra is closer to phenomenology than idealism, disagreeing with Stcherbatsky's correlation of Yogācāra with Kant's transcendental idealism.
* He distinguishes three kinds of idealism: metaphysical, epistemological, and critical epistemological. 
* He claims that Yogācāra does not fit any of these categories because it doesn't posit a cosmic mind, a non-reducible self, or the unknowability of other.

## - The Nature of Rūpa in Yogācāra

* Lusthaus emphasizes understanding pre-Yogācāra Buddhist basics about *rūpa* (materiality) to grasp Yogācāra's position.
* He explains that *rūpa* signifies both materiality and sentient materiality, inseparable from sentiency. 
* Early Abhidharma texts treat *rūpa* as both sensorial/cognitive and emblematic of an alien etiology, arising and ceasing by conditions.

## - The Shift to Epistemology

* Lusthaus notes a shift in Abhidharma texts towards cognition and epistemology, exemplified by the displacement of *rūpa* with *sparśa* (contact) and *cetanā* (volition) with *saṃskāra*.
* He argues that Yogācāra's *vijñapti-mātra* invites an epistemological attitude of self-deconstruction, not one focused on validating what is.

## - Rūpa as Projection

* Lusthaus contends that the important point about *rūpa* for Yogācārins is not its ontological status but why it is projected.
* He argues that projections of "rūpic-consciousness" are the enabling condition for the self-engrossing project of consciousness itself.
*  He concludes that *rūpa*, as a categorial projection, constitutes consciousness and is a necessary condition for its existence.

# Lambert Schmithausen'S Critique Of Lusthaus

* Schmithausen argues against Lusthaus's interpretation of Yogācāra, claiming it implies a commitment to the independent existence of matter outside mind.
* He criticizes Lusthaus's translation of a key passage in the *Cheng weishi lun*, arguing that it misrepresents the text's meaning regarding the nature of *rūpa*.

# ~ The Case

* Schmithausen objects to Lusthaus's claim that Yogācārins believe in the independent existence of matter (*rūpa*), citing passages where Lusthaus seems to support this view.
* He provides an alternative translation of a crucial passage, arguing that it shows *rūpa* is not perceived directly but only as an image developed by the cognizing mind.

#  Rūpic-consciousness


* Rūpic-consciousness provides a sense of agency through the interaction with the external world ("I push this bowl of cereal onto the floor, therefore I am!").
* It also highlights the gap in our agency of relations, as we take the external world for granted despite its dependence on our cognitive processes.

## ~ Antidotal Soteriology

* Schmithausen argues that Yogācāra does not necessarily deny the existence of external matter. 
* He suggests that the *Cheng weishi lun*'s focus is on how "externality" is constructed rather than on proving or disproving the existence of matter.
* Schmithausen interprets the term "*mātra*" as excluding only the naive grasping of matter as independent from consciousness.

##  The Role of "*Mātra*" in Yogācāra Meditation

* Huimin Bhikṣu traces the use of "*mātra*" to denote stages of purification or progress on the path in various Buddhist texts.
* He suggests that "*mātra*" indicates a meditative-epistemological approach aimed at reducing deluded states by progressively purifying the modes of constructing experience.

##  Schmithausen's Critique of Lusthaus

* Schmithausen argues against Lusthaus's interpretation of the *Cheng weishi lun*, suggesting that he misrepresents Yogācāra's stance on the independent existence of matter.
* He criticizes Lusthaus for focusing on a straw man argument and for attributing views to Kuiji that are not supported by Xuanzang.

##  The Interplay of Mental Factors and Karmic Processes

* The *Cheng weishi lun* describes mental factors operating within a closed karmic loop where "external" and "internal" are co-respondent and emergent.
* "Externality" is seen as indeterminable apart from subject-object co-determining processes.
* The *ālayavijñāna* functions as a medium or gap essential to ordinary perception and karmic effect, preventing direct connection between observer and observed.

##  The Nature of Reality in Yogācāra


* Yogācāra avoids making definitive claims about the reality of the material world. 
* Instead, it focuses on the provisional functioning of mental constructs and their role in karmic processes.
* The quest for objective reality is seen as a product of afflictive "seeds" that need to be decommissioned through antidotal practices.

## ~ The Spiritual Context

* Schmithausen argues against interpretations of Yogācāra as idealism, suggesting they are influenced by dominant discourses.
* He advocates understanding texts in their own terms and acknowledges Lusthaus's insights into central Buddhist concerns.
* Schmithausen emphasizes the centrality of karma and intention in Buddhism, arguing that the process starts and ends in the mind.

##  

* Schmithausen highlights the Yogācāric view of intersubjectivity, where the material world is experienced through presuppositions formed by other beings.
* He suggests that advanced bodhisattvas or buddhas can return to a level of *vijñaptimātratā*, experiencing the dependent world as illusory.

##  

* Schmithausen argues that *vijñaptimātratā* is the essential structure of any experience, even for buddhas and bodhisattvas.
* He suggests that the transformation of the impure world into a pure one through spiritual practice is plausible because it is only an image in mind.

##  

* Jonathan Gold critiques the common understanding of Yogācāra as "mind-only," arguing that Vasubandhu equates "mind" and "appearance."
* He emphasizes that Vasubandhu's point is not to affirm the reality of the mental at the expense of the physical but to highlight the lack of independent nature in both.
* Gold argues that Vasubandhu does not rely on direct experience but bases his expositions on scripture and rational arguments.

## - Robert Sharf And "Phenomenology"

*  Sharf rejects any analogizing of Xuanzang's Yogācāra with Husserlian phenomenology, arguing that it focuses on subliminal processes and metaphysical entities rather than lived experience.
* He criticizes both Yogācāra and Dignāga/Dharmakīrti traditions for failing to relate conceptual content to non-conceptual experience.

## - Buddhist Soteriology and Phenomenology

* Sharf's critique relies on a false dichotomy between "lived experience" and the "noumenal," which are conceptually dependent on each other.
* Buddhists and phenomenologists share methods of deconstructing projections of subjective experience as "the world."
* The *Cheng weishi lun* presents propositions about experience from an omniscient perspective, using reasoning, metaphor, and scripture to support them.

## - First-Personal Experience in the *Cheng weishi lun*

* The text does not rely on first-personal accounts but draws upon scriptural authority and expert commentary.
* Validating claims of specialists is always subject to interrogation, but general observer-agreement is not a foundational criterion for evaluating teachings in this context.

## - "Phenomenal" vs. Epistemological Phenomenology

* Sharf identifies "omnipresent mental factors" as potentially suitable for phenomenological analysis due to their experiential character.
* However, he reduces experience to "raw feel," aligning it with phenomenalism rather than epistemological phenomenology.
* This reductionism ignores the Buddhist focus on understanding how patterns of construction create karmic effect.

## - Contact and Karmic Causation

* Sharf interprets Xuanzang's discussion of "contact" as a concern with conceptual puzzles, but it actually addresses the role of contact in causal chains of experience.
* The *Cheng weishi lun* deconstructs the illusory "as suchness" of contact, revealing its karmic function as a unique contributor to karma.

## - Deconstructing Illusory Experience

* Sharf correctly points out that the *Cheng weishi lun* does not treat contact as an entity with phenomenal properties.
* However, this does not exclude a phenomenology of deconstructing illusory experiences like "raw feel" and dualizing metaphysical projections.
* The text emphasizes the transformative activities of reaction and inference that constantly shape experience.

## - Subjectivity and Objectivity

* Sharf acknowledges the "Mobius strip" quality of texts engaging with subjective and objective modes of experience.
* He suggests that establishing a stable relationship between pre-discursive awareness and conceptual content was the aim of both Husserl and Dignāga, but this is debatable.

# Buddhist Phenomenology

* Includes Merleau-Ponty's "intentional arc" and Derrida's *différance*.
* More like a phenomenology of the Mobius strip.
* Entangles contemporary empirical approaches that unpack the constructed nature of experience.

# A Challenge to Sharf's Reductionism

* Challenges Sharf's reductionist assumption that Yogācāra can be seen as purely scholastic or naively aiming to ascertain "latent categories, causal processes, and underlying structures of experience."
* Questions whether representation of "how the world appears first-personally" is truly the foundation of Buddhist phenomenology.

# Straw Men and Self-Misdirection

* Argues that Sharf's critique relies on straw men—hypothetical practitioners of phenomenology grounded in "raw feel" or contemplation as excavation to prediscursive awareness.
* Points out that grasping "how the world appears first-personally" is known to be self-misdirection in Buddhist contexts.

# The Mobius Strip and Co-Dependence

* Highlights the Mobius-strip quality of self/awareness-of-self as a tool for realizing co-dependence/emptiness, not a flaw in the method.
* Emphasizes that the self-contradictions involved in self-construction are always available to experience.

# Beyond Naïve Materialism

* Argues that Buddhist phenomenology reveals the mutual specification of subject and object that undercuts the foundational premises of naïve materialism: object stability, independence from the observer, and irreducibility of observer agreement.
* Suggests that it also undermines relational realism ("unity"), "pure consciousness," and nihilism.

# Triangulating Practices with Scripture and Reasoning

* Agrees with Sharf that cessation of phenomena-constructing activities is crucial but adds that first-personal practices of phenomenological focus are also essential.
* Emphasizes the importance of triangulating these practices with authoritative exegesis, reasoning, and study of precedents.

# Chen-kuo Lin's Perspective on Insight

* Introduces Chen-kuo Lin's arguments about the intentional structure of insight in Zhiyi's Tiantai philosophy.
* Explains how Lin argues for a threefold structure of insight based on the Yogācāra theory of the "three natures."

# The Functioning of Knowing

* Highlights Lin's point that focus on one's own experience is intrinsic to Zhiyi's soteriology.
* Emphasizes that what is known-without-knower in Buddhist phenomenology is not "pure consciousness" or "conceptual content," but the structured/structuring activities of knowing.

## - Uses Of The Viṃśatikā

* A Buddhist "phenomenology of awakening" is evident in the work of Dignāga scholars Birgit Kellner and John Taber.
* They argue that Vasubandhu's *Viṃśatikā* uses a strategy of questioning propositions about the nature of objects to undermine assumptions and projections.
* The existence of external objects as independent causes cannot be proven, supporting the soteriological aim of recognizing the workings of the grasper-grasped relation.

## - Mark Siderits's Interpretation

* Mark Siderits characterizes Yogācāra as a way to make sense of emptiness by denying the existence of external objects.
* He emphasizes Buddhist teachings being investigated for oneself through rational inquiry and logical analysis.
* Siderits suggests that Yogācāra is a form of idealism based on the idea that nothing exists other than mental things.

## - Comparing Translations

* The author compares translations of Vasubandhu's *Viṃśatikā* by Mark Siderits and Stefan Anacker.
* Anacker's translation emphasizes the three realms of existence being determined as perception-only, including "citta" (consciousness) and its associations.
* Anacker clarifies that "only" rules out the externality of objects as they appear to the senses, not their external existence.

## - Stefan Anacker's Position

* Stefan Anacker also decries the misreading of the *Viṃśatikā* as idealist.

## The Twenty Verses

* This text explores common misunderstandings of Vasubandhu's *The Twenty Verses*.
* It clarifies that consciousness doesn't unilaterally create all forms, but rather objects are "internal" and external stimuli are inferrable.
* Perceptions are colored by individual consciousness-seeds, highlighting the Yogācāric view that the internal/external opposition is illusory.

## Xuanzang on Consciousness-Only

* Xuanzang understood the non-idealist nature of "consciousness-only."
* He argued that while it corrects false attachments to external objects, interpreting it as "only consciousness is real" is counterproductive and supports appropriative drives.

## The Viṃśatikā Dialogue

* Vasubandhu presents a dialogue about experiences in different realms depending on karmic conditions.
* The question arises: why are hell-beings experienced if they don't have the karma for it?
* Two translations (Siderits and Anacker) offer different interpretations of the Yogācāra representative's response, with Siderits emphasizing faith in karma and Anacker highlighting logical inconsistencies.

## Consciousness Transformation

* The dialogue continues with the questioner accepting karmic production but still clinging to the reality of hell-beings.
* The representative challenges this by suggesting that consciousness itself is transformed by karma, not external elements.
* This reinforces the idea that phenomena arise from interdependent processes and are not independent entities.

## Mind-Only and Non-Duality

* Jonathan Gold argues that Vasubandhu's focus is on undermining the imputed reality of the self, not the object.
* The "magical illusion" represents mistaken apprehension of the self, not external reality.
* Mind-only is a stage towards recognizing non-duality, which focuses on the relationship between mind and mental objects.

## Implications for Buddhist Studies

* Jan Westerhoff's talk highlights conflicts between modern historiography and traditional Buddhism's focus on *buddhavacana*.
* He discusses criteria for determining authentic *buddhavacana*, including correspondence with *dharmatā* (the nature of reality).
* Westerhoff identifies four ways Buddhist philosophy clashes with historical realism, including the absence of a common perspective due to karmic influences.

## Karmic Dimension and Historical Narratives

* The *Viṃśatikā* example of clear water appearing as pus to a hungry ghost illustrates how perception is shaped by karma.
* Buddhist historians must consider different versions of events due to this karmic dimension, which constitutes "conventional truth."




# Implications of a Relativistic View of History

* A relativistic view of history demands greater ethical commitment as it emphasizes the causal impact of individual actions.

# The Aims of Traditional Buddhist Historians

* Emulate how the world appears through purified perception.
* Highlight what contributes to liberation.

#  Westerhoff's Theory and Practice

* Westerhoff advocates for considering soteriology and phenomenology in Buddhist writing and scholarship.
* A potential gap exists between his theory and practice, as evidenced by his view on Lusthaus's position on Yogacara idealism.

# The Phenomenological Problem of Karma

* Yogācārins believe that while dream-like experiences are products of mental construction, their relational effects are real.
*  The example of a wet dream illustrates how dream images can have physical consequences.
* Enlightened beings possess "great mirror cognition," which transcends karmic limitations and cannot be described in conventional terms.

# The Scope of Buddhas

* Vasubandhu's *Viṃśatikā* suggests that the knowledge of enlightened beings is beyond the scope of dialectics and ordinary perception.
* Reaching the "scope of Buddhas" involves escaping the cycle of reflexivity and dualisms.

# Two Economies of Belief

* The modern paradigm emphasizes observer-agreement and statistical significance.
* The Dilun exegetes believed in the possibility of direct nondual perception, attainable through faith and practice.
* Confusing these two belief systems leads to misunderstandings about Yogācāra idealism.

## Path Constructions In Dilun Texts

* This section examines path structures embedded in Yogācāra and *tathāgatagarbha* texts, focusing specifically on Dilun practitioners.
* Chen-kuo Lin analyzes two Dunhuang manuscripts (S. 4303 and S. 613) to highlight a unique Sinitic integration of *pramāṇa* and *tathāgatagarbha* in paths of practice.

* **Dilun Interest in Pramāṇa:**
    * Dilun interest in *pramāṇa*, methods for establishing valid knowledge, is understood within the context of delineating stages in the path of cultivation.
    * This approach represents a "phenomenology of awakening" focused on cognitive change rather than fixed structures of subjective perception.

* **S. 4303 (*Guang siliang yi*)**:
    * Presents a Dilun-inflected reading of four *pramāṇa*: perception, inference, testimony, and teaching.
    * Each type corresponds with sequential stages in the path of practice and is seen as characterizing both path and attainment.

* **Cognitive Development:**
    * Direct perception is a means from the beginning of the path and characterizes the perception of a buddha.
    * These epistemological stages correlated with phenomenological shifts in cognition are discussed in terms influenced by Chinese *tathāgatagarbha* thought.

* **Dilun Ontology:**
    * Lin argues that Dilun scholars formulated a unique "indigenous" ontology to complement their soteriology, contrasting with Xuanzang's later orthodox Yogācāra contextualization of *pramāṇa*.

* **Mind and Dharma Interrelationship:**
    * The taxonomy in S. 4303 is structured in terms of "mind" (subject of cognition) and "dharma" (object of cognition), understood as dynamically corresponding functions.

* **Four-Part Categorization of Object of Cognition:**
    * S. 4303 lays out a four-part categorization: name, characteristic, function, and substance. These are taken as the objects of the *pramāṇa*.

* **Path-Orientation of Pramāṇic Practice:**
    * The objects of cognition are arranged in order according to the progressive path of cultivation.

* **Dilun Schema and Abhidharma Taxonomies:**
    * Lin argues that these Dilun schema share a key feature with Abhidharma taxonomies: they can only be understood as correspondents with levels of meditative attainment.

* **Co-Constituting Cognitive Modes and Manifested States:**
    * The examples illustrate the underlying soteriological uncertainty principle pursued through various fields of practice: cognitive modes and manifested states are co-constituting.

* **"Map of the Dharmadhātu" (*Fajie tu*)**:
    * Lin notes similarities between S. 4303 and this Dunhuang manuscript, where stages of cultivation are correlated with parallel means of cognition.

* **Holistic Approach:**
    * Dilun exegetes complemented their analytic gradual approach grounded in *pramāṇa* with a holistic or subitist approach that integrated *tathāgatagarbha* focus on the emptiness of intrinsic nature.

* **Cause and Fruition:**
    * Lin discusses supporting structures of analysis in terms of cause and fruition, or *yuanzhao* (dualistic illumination) and *tizhao* (self-illumination).

* **Causal Function of Truth (*tathatā*)**:
    * S. 4303 attributes a causal function to suchness or truth, which is unique in the context of Indian Buddhism.

* **Dilun Understanding of Self-Awareness of Truth:**
    * Lin suggests that Dilun understanding can be seen as the self-illuminating "transcendental/ontological" ground of beings.

* **Absolute Idealism?**:
    * While Lin labels this "Absolute Idealism," he expresses ambivalence about whether to interpret Dilun use of *tizhao* simply as nonconceptual cognition or as a unique Dilun axiom asserting the causal existence and agency of *tathatā*.





# Conclusion: "Harmonizing The Debates"
* Dilun-style integration of tathāgatagarbha can be seen in later Chinese Yogācāra.
* Xuanzang's version of tathatā may not have been so far from Dilun as is sometimes thought.
* *Tathatā* is not merely a *prajñapti* but the transconceptual, ineffable true ultimate nature (*dharmatā*) of everything.

# Chapter Six Reliquaries, Images, And Mediators
* Tengo and Kumi picked up select bones from their father's remains and placed them in a small urn.
* Tengo received the urn and didn't know what to do with it but knew he couldn't abandon it. 




## What Do We Do With It?

* Murakami's protagonist sifts through remnants of his possible father, following tradition in mortuary rituals.
* Mortuary rituals reclaim control over the body's decomposition and its effects.
* Donors and sculptors at Baoshan combined devotional imagery to create a unique style of mortuary monument.
* The Baoshan site features 175 niches, many containing seated representations of the deceased.

## The Seeds of Baoshan's Mortuary Grove

* Two Northern Qi pagodas founded the "mortuary grove" at Baoshan.
* Over time, devotees and artisans developed a style of mortuary construction with stūpa-shaped niches containing images.
* These niches are among the earliest Chinese Buddhist reliquaries to include such images.

## Mortuary Images and Their Contexts

* Most extant Baoshan/Lanfengshan mortuary images reside in niches carved into limestone outcroppings.
* Clerics' niches are stūpa-shaped, while laypersons' niches resemble Chinese temples or homes.
* These niches differ from donor-images found at cave-temples, which typically depict individuals standing or kneeling.

## A Changing Landscape: Damage and Preservation

* Baoshan and Lanfengshan images have sustained damage over time due to weather and human activity.
* The sites' custodians face challenges in preserving these fragile monuments.


## Pathways Through the Forest

* This chapter explores three pathways through the mortuary grove, examining reliquary stūpas, buddha images, and images of practitioners.
* It investigates the interplay between faith, visualization practices, and social construction in relation to buddha-image veneration.
* The chapter also delves into Sanjie practices at Baoshan, including corpse exposure and enshrined relics.

## Images as Mediators

* Mortuary images function as mediators, connecting the deceased, donors, and practitioners.
* They represent a complex interplay of desire, representation, and transactional agency.




## Reliquary Stūpas

* Reliquary stūpas were among the earliest Buddhist structures, holding relics of the Buddha after his cremation.
* The practice of relic-veneration spread widely with Buddhism and continues today.
* King Aśoka is credited with collecting Buddha relics and building numerous stūpas to distribute them.
* In India, stūpas containing body-relics or Dharma-relics (sūtras and dhāraṇī) became pilgrimage destinations.

## Imposition of Etic Distinctions

* Early Western scholarship often viewed relic-veneration as backward or ethnographic.
* British archaeologists even cleared away votive stūpas around Bodh-Gayā and Sāñcī.
* Recent scholarship has emphasized emic contextualization, understanding Buddhist practices from within the tradition.

## Reliquary Stūpas as Living Persons

* Gregory Schopen argues that early Buddhists treated reliquary stūpas as living persons.
* They had property rights, functioned in Buddhist networks, and provided economic support for monks and nuns.
* The destruction of a stūpa was considered equivalent to murder, highlighting the belief in its continued presence.

## Docetic Buddhology and Buddha Nature

* Radich's "docetic Buddhology" thesis suggests that some Buddhists denied the physical reality of the Buddha's body.
* This view emphasized the Buddha's incorporeal nature and challenged the efficacy of worshipping relics.
* The concept of "Buddha nature" (*buddhadhātu*) may have emerged as an alternative to the relic cult, emphasizing the universal potential for enlightenment.

# A Famous Example

* Wang argues that Famen reliquaries represent a late-Tang amalgamation of ritual symbolism derived from both esoteric Buddhism and Daoism.
* This ritual blend depended on the idea of relics as the "true body" (*zhenshen*) in order to negotiate efficacious homologies between Buddha-relics, transmutation of the emperor's body, and the welfare of the realm.

# Looking At Buddha Images

* Studies of Buddhist images have attempted to counter views that denigrated image-centered practices as idolatrous.
* For Lingyu and his contemporaries, activities like sponsoring images, ritual evocation, repentance, chanting, and visualization of buddha-bodies were considered integral to moral, contemplative, and intellectual disciplines.
* These were mutually reinforcing arts in a "meshwork" designed to actualize the Dharma.

# "Thus Have I Seen"

* Andy Rotman investigates the complex interrelations of images, offerings, and narratives in *Thus Have I Seen: Visualizing Faith in Early Indian Buddhism*.
* He elucidates the moral, social, emotional, and even erotic aspects of *avadāna* ("noble deeds") stories of seeing and believing.
* Rotman discusses two key terms, *śraddhā* (faith) and *prasāda* (spontaneous feeling of attraction and generosity inspired by seeing certain persons and objects).
* The ability to achieve faith in the unseeable system of karma was critically important for Buddhist practitioners.
* Rotman designates the special foci that inspire generosity as "agents of prasāda," or *prāsādika* objects.



## The Power Of Shadows

* Potent feedback loops of seeing, hearing, believing, and telling created a related body of Chinese Buddhist tales of interventions by images.
* Such images were said to be moved by the "causes and conditions" arising from sincere belief.
* Active interventions by images were often associated with King Aśoka's meritorious mission.

## Like all manifestations of emptiness

* These were understood to "be" in the karmic conditions, not the eyes, of the beholder.
* In the early fifth century, the famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Faxian reported on his experience of the *foying* phenomenon.
* When Xuanzang travelled to India in the seventh century he reported that the phenomenon had declined.

##  Not incidentally, the *Guanfo sanmei hai jing* also includes a description of the Nagarahāra "Buddha's shadow" phenomenon: 

* This technique of direct access to the Dharma offered by an image is found in one of the earliest canonical sources for buddha-contemplation available in China.
* This text prescribes visualizing an idealized image of the body of the Buddha and at the same time realizing its correspondence with the perfection of awakening to emptiness.

## "Looking as a process" would accord with our previous investigation of w/riting, repentance and vows as ongoing processes enabling access to the beneficial agency of relations. 
* Results or products like a copied scripture, a foresworn vice, a completed ritual, or a "seen" buddha would in this logic of practice be ancillary good signs or auspicious relics, not the main event.

## In both the *Guanfo sanmei hai jing* and related *Guan* wuliangshou fo jing, the stages of deliberate visualization enact or trigger purificatory visions.
* These are meant to enable realization that the mediation of image-generation and the unmediated are nondual.
* This was thought to actualize rather than obviate the efficacy of image-generation.

## Let us expand on the idea of the shadow as the "real body of the Buddha." 

* Throughout this study I reference variations in the semantic field of the "true image": *zhenxiang* 真像 (true image), *zhenxiang* 真相 (true characteristics), *zhenxing* 真形 (true form), *zhenshen* 真身 (true body), *zhenzan* 真讚 (portrait eulogy), *zhenrong* 真容 (true appearance or true face).
* In these references to "true" form, it is important to keep in mind that in these contexts the truth of a buddha-body is *upāya*.

## Wei-cheng Lin, in his discussion of images of Mañjuśrī at Wutai shan 五臺 山, translates *zhenrong* as "true presence." 
* While Lin's case for translating *zhenrong* as "true presence" indeed restores an aspect of the relationship between beholder and image that is often ignored, I am wary of bifurcating "divine" presence (as if it was believed to be lodged in an object) and appearance (as if this was considered a lesser-order effect). 


# True Appearance/Looking

* True appearance is not localizable in the seer or the image itself.
* It arises from the interplay of physical, narrative, social, and soteriological effects evoked by bodies.

# Zhen as Affective Process

* "*Zhen*" (true) is understood as a process rather than a static presence.
* This concept can be found inscribed on Buddhist images and objects.

# Aniconic Shadow in Buddha Representations

* The lack of ultimate reality associated with buddha-bodies leads to an "aniconic" shadow in representations.
* Variations exist in the Udāyana-image story, ranging from iconophile to aniconic versions.
* Medieval Chinese exegetes expressed ambivalence towards the soteriological role of images.

# Image-Worship and Transformative Experiences

* Images were seen as opportunities for fleeting yet transformative experiences.
* These experiences required neither extensive visualization practice nor ultimate realization of emptiness.
* The ease of access to such experiences could also undermine their effectiveness.

# The Economy of Faith and Consecrated Images

* Even brief glimpses of liberation contributed to the complex economy of faith.
* Consecrated images were essential agents in translating offerings into merit.
* They played a central role in social-devotional rituals affirming membership within the saṃgha.

# The Process of Looking

* Considerable material and technical resources went into "the process of looking."
* This involved the ritual, rhetorical, social, and manual skills of clergy, donors, and artisans.
* Images acted as conduits for "warm energies," connecting the mundane with the numinous.




## The Buddha Images At Dazhusheng Cave

* Three stone statues enshrined in Dazhusheng cave: Vairocana, Maitreya, and Amitābha.
* Interpretations of these images vary, including "buddhas of the three times" and trikāya rubric.
* Vairocana as the truth-body (fashen), Amitābha as the bliss-body (baoshen), and Maitreya as the response-body (yingshen).

## The *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*

* Provides context for buddha-naming practice at Dazhusheng.
* Inscription above the cave entrance attributes inspiration for buddha-naming to the *Avataṃsaka*.
* Significance of the text explored further in relation to Vairocana and Mahāmāyā.

## The Relationship Between the Three Main Images

* Li Yumin presents two interpretations: "buddhas of the three times" and trikāya rubric.
* "Buddhas of the three times": Vairocana (present), seven buddhas (past), Maitreya (future).
* Amitābha as an intersection of past and present, merit and response.

## Vairocana in Chinese Buddhist Discourse

* Vairocana's prominence reflects regional doctrinal affiliations.
* More popular among monastics compared to other buddha cults like Avalokitēśvara and Śākyamuni.
* Natural choice for the Dilun group due to its central role in the *Avataṃsaka*.

## The Inscription at Dazhusheng

* Inscription on the south wall above the entrance: *Huayanjing ji* (Verses from the *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*).
* Reinforces buddha-name recitation practice supported by Dazhusheng.
* "Buddhas' names" symbolize all images and buddha-names in the cave. 




## - Mahāmāyā And Vairocana: Engendering The Dharma-Realm In Dazhusheng Cave

* The text explores the relationship between Mahāmāyā and Vairocana in the context of the *Avataṃsaka* sūtra, specifically focusing on their roles in representing the *dharmadhātu*.
* The *dharmadhātu* is described as an all-encompassing concept that includes both transcendent realms and mundane existence. It signifies the interconnectedness of reality and the ultimate nature of enlightenment.

## - Vairocana's Emanation

* The text highlights two sections in the *Avataṃsaka* where Māyā brings forth Vairocana's emanation as Śākyamuni, emphasizing birth-centered perspectives on the *dharmadhātu*.
* These sections present contrasting yet complementary views of the *dharmadhātu*: Māyā's protean forms reflect its illusory karmic aspect, while Vairocana embodies the all-pervasive Dharma.

## - The Significance of Sudhana's Pilgrimage

* The narrative framework of the *Gaṇḍavyūha* revolves around Sudhana's pilgrimage, guided by Mañjuśrī, to understand the nature of the *dharmadhātu*.
* Sudhana encounters fifty-three spiritual guides, including female teachers who play a significant role in his journey.

## - The Role of Female Figures

* The text emphasizes the unusually balanced representation of gender among Sudhana's guides, with approximately half being female.
* This positive portrayal of women contrasts with other Buddhist literature that often depicts female bodies as polluted or associated with decay.

## - Māyā's Cosmic Birth-Vision

* Sudhana encounters Sutejomaṇḍalaratiśrī and Māyā herself, who recount their visions of Māyā giving birth to Vairocana/Śākyamuni in Lumbini Grove.
* These cosmic birth-visions highlight the transformative nature of buddha-birthing and challenge traditional negative views of female bodies.

## - Vairocana's Representation at Dazhusheng Cave

* The text analyzes the iconography of Vairocana at Dazhusheng cave, specifically the *renzhong* type that depicts the five *gatis* on his robe.
* This representation symbolizes Vairocana's embodiment of the *dharmadhātu*, encompassing all realms and destinies.




# Mahāmāyā, Lotus, and Śrīmālādevī Passages

* The passages chosen suggest relations of filial piety as a key element of buddha-responsiveness.
* The *Mahāmāyā* features Śākyamuni's responsiveness as the ultimate filial son, traveling to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven to give his mother the gift of the Dharma.

# Śākyamuni as an Ideal Father Figure

* The *Lotus* presents Śākyamuni as an ideal paternal figure.
* A passage from the "Lifespan of the Tathāgata" chapter carved on Dazhusheng depicts Śākyamuni speaking as a father, saving those who suffer and are afflicted.

# Buddha-Response in Northern Qi Buddhist World

* Generating faith in buddha-response was a prominent theme throughout the Northern Qi Buddhist world.
* Wei Shou, an official of the Eastern Wei and Northern Qi, wrote about the rise and fall of the Northern Wei dynasty.
* He explained the *dharmakāya*, weaving together its emptiness and responsiveness in all realms and forms.

# Wei Shou's Account of Buddha-Efficacy

* Wei Shou combined Two Truths doctrine with Chinese theories of stimulus-response to present a buddha-body theory.
* The "buddhas' body of the Law" (*dharmakāya*) is unimpeded spontaneous response as the true nature of reality.

# Nirvāṇa-sūtra and Buddha-Response

* Wei Shou's account draws from the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra*.
* He explains how buddha-embodiment works, concluding that nirvāṇa is translated as extinction-and-passing-over (*miedu*), permanence, joy, self, and purity.

# Baoshan Verses and Nirvāṇa

* The east wall outside the cave at Baoshan features an elaboration on the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra* story known as the *Brāhmana Jātaka*.
* These verses elaborate on nirvāṇa as permanence, joy, self, and purity.

# Buddha-Body Theories and Pure Land

* In the seventh century, clerics developed more rigorous theoretical arguments regarding the buddha-body nature of Amitābha.
* Huiyuan/Huixiu's Dasheng yizhang passage on "bodies of a certain nature" corresponding to "lands of a certain nature" reflects this debate.


# Emptiness/Coinherence and Buddha-Agency

* Emptiness/coinherence enabled the merciful "agency of relations" of the buddhas to work throughout a utopia of stable groundlessness.
* This is represented in the *Avataṃsaka* through Vairocana and Mahāmāyā.
* In the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra*, permanence, joy, self, and purity are the true nature of the tathāgatas.

# Baoshan Necropolis and Family Tombs

* Wei Shou compared containers for buddha-relics to family tombs.
* At Baoshan, ta did become family tombs, enshrining the merit of Dharma and kinship relations.
* Unlike inhabitants of family tombs, residents of Baoshan's necropolis kept their doors open, welcoming all members of the Dharma family.

## Images Of Practitioners Aspiring Buddhas

* Reproductions of Buddhist Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, *saṃgha*) served as foci for vows and prayers.
* Ordained *saṃgha* became objects of veneration, seen as models for self-liberation and mediators of salvific power.
* Similarities and distinctions exist between devotional images and representations of the ordained, both woven together in the notion of taking refuge.

## Textual Representations Of Eminent Monks

* In China, textual representations of eminent monks were important for spreading Buddhist devotion.
* Chinese literary tradition of compiling biographies provided an adaptable medium for Buddhist exemplars.
* Collections of parables or "retribution cases" (*avadāna*, *piyu*) translated from the third century onward included stories of Buddha and his disciples' lives.
* Scripture-prefaces highlighted faith and vows of early translator-monks.
* Sixth century saw a surge in Buddhist biographical collections, including accounts of Indian monks in China, Chinese monks, and nuns' biographies.

## Enshrining Representations Of Deceased Masters

* Adaptations of the Indian practice of enshrining relics of eminent monks and nuns in stūpas emerged in China from the sixth century onward.
* Biographies and portraiteulogies mention enshrining representations of deceased masters.
* These representations sometimes included lacquered mummies or statues mixed with cremation ashes.
* Mortuary niches at Baoshan are early material remnants of combining cremation relics, images, and inscribed memorials for offerings.

## Transmission Of Dharma And Images Of Masters

* At Baoshan, we find an early precedent for venerating Buddhist masters as conduits of Śākyamuni's Dharma alongside buddha images.
* Shallow-relief carvings in Dazhusheng cave depict the succession of twenty-four masters who transmitted the Dharma.
* The *Fu fazang [yinyuan] zhuan*, likely a sixth-century compilation, served as the source text for these images.

## Ideology Of Dharma Transmission And "Final Age" Sensibilities

* The *Fu fazang zhuan* presents a narrow definition of true Dharma, identifying a single line of transmission from master to disciple.
* It upholds a "final age" message predicting the decline of the Dharma after the twenty-third generation master.
* This ideology resonated with later Tiantai and Chan texts but required creative supplementation to justify unbroken lineages.

## Self-Transformation Practices And Image Making

* Art historian Katherine Tsiang links individualized buddha images "in the round" to prayers for becoming buddhas (*chengfo*) prevalent in Eastern Wei-Northern Qi inscriptions.
* These prayers reflect self-transformation practices and ordination rituals where practitioners consecrated new identities as bodhisattvas.
* The spread of *tathāgatagarbha* ideas contributed to this aspiration, emphasizing the inherent buddha nature within all beings.

## Representations Of Aspiring Devotees And Post-Mortem Transformation

* Qingzhou sculptures suggest that images might represent aspiring devotees, reflecting both approachable human quality and individualized characteristics.
* Murals in Lou Rui's tomb blend Han motifs with Buddhist elements, possibly depicting him in an ascended form.
* Scriptures like the *Sukhāvativyūha*, *Śrīmālādevī*, and *Lotus* influenced beliefs about post-mortem transformation and ascending to Sukhāvatī.



## Corpse Exposure And Enshrined Relics

* This section discusses the practice of transmuting physical remains into relics.
* Special handling and housing of Buddha's relics were considered distinctive features of Buddhism, drawing both admiration and criticism.
* The author begins with a large-scale imperially sponsored Buddha-relic campaign in the Sui dynasty and then turns to the Baoshan niches as reliquaries for members of the immediate community.

##  Relics and Self-Offering

* Many of the niches at Baoshan are designated as reliquaries for ashes, but a subset may have commemorated extreme practices, including self-offering through postmortem exposure of the body (forest interment).
* This ritual was carried out by some members of the community. After a period of exposure, the scattered bones were collected and cremated.

##  Emperor Sui Wendi's Relic Campaign

* The proliferation of relic-centered practices may have been inspired by Emperor Sui Wendi's relic-distribution campaign.
* Tanqian, Lingyu's fellow disciple and one of Huixiu's teachers, had a key role in promoting court-sponsored relic worship during the Renshou era (601–604).

##  Relics and Political Pageantry

* This campaign was an empire-wide pageant that could have inspired emulation among those who could not claim access to relics of the Buddha.
* In the seventh and eighth centuries, there was increasing interest in the processes of transmutation of bodies of exemplary practitioners into efficacious relics housed in special shrines.

##  The Emperor's Repentance

* Chen Jinhua argues that Tanqian may have been the one who planted and nurtured the seeds for a series of elaborate relic-distribution rituals.
* The emperor claimed solidarity with all his subjects in a prayer of repentance and aspiration that the Three Treasures aid in removing obstacles to buddha-becoming. 


##  Relic Power at Baoshan

* Imperial relic-enshrinement may have provided a model, but the Baoshan community seems to have developed its own means of assimilating the relic-power of its members.
* Special relics produced through corpse exposure or "forest interment" (*linzang*) may have played a role in this development.

##  Forest Interment

* Accounts of corpse exposure were often associated with ascetic practitioners, perhaps because one of the traditional *dhūtaguṇas* ("qualities of purification" or ascetic practices) was residence in a cemetery.
* The "Yishen 遺身 (Abandoning the Body)" section of the *Xu gaoseng zhuan* vividly conveys the quality of extreme generosity that was attributed to this final offering.

##  Evidence at Baoshan

* At Baoshan there is one explicit reference to forest-interment among the memorials, for the nun Sengshun 僧順 (LFS 47).
* There are five other descriptions that point to it: the monks Jingzheng 靜證 (BS 4), Huijing (LFS 25), and Huixiu (LFS 26), and the nuns Jinggan 靜感 (LFS 42) and Puxiang 普相 (LFS 45).

# The Question of *Linzang* at Baoshan

* Scholars debate whether *linzang*, corpse exposure practiced by Sanjie Buddhists, was widespread at Baoshan.
* Liu Shufen argues that Sanjie-inspired *linzang* was common at Baoshan, citing numerous inscriptions mentioning exposed corpses and forest burials.
* However, many of these inscriptions refer to general entombment practices, not necessarily *linzang*.

# Interpreting Mortuary Inscriptions

* Liu identifies various terms in the inscriptions as markers for *linzang*, but some are ambiguous or refer to cremation without prior exposure.
* The gap between death date and stūpa dedication does not automatically indicate corpse exposure; it could reflect logistical reasons or preferred dedication dates.

# Sanjie Perception in the Mid-Seventh Century

* It is unclear how Sanjie followers were perceived by clerics at Baoshan during this period.
* Some sources portray them negatively as unlearned zealots, but these characteristics wouldn't necessarily distinguish them from other practitioners at Baoshan.

# The Case of Lingchen

* Dhyāna Master Lingchen's inscription provides the most detailed account of a Sanjie practitioner's death process and *linzang*.
* It mentions his adherence to Xinxing's teachings, his wish for corpse exposure, and the subsequent cremation and stūpa construction.

# Calendrical Significance

* The inscription uses the asterism Yuanxiao (Xuanxiao), associated with both endings and new beginnings, potentially alluding to the cyclical nature of life and death.
* This complex calendrical reference adds another layer of meaning to Lingchen's memorial.

# The successors thus made a eulogy saying:

* Distantly hearing the Primal Wind, he pondered on high and considered from afar.
* The Three Trainings he completely abandoned, the One Vehicle alone went smoothly.
* Beginning with the first shock of Dharma thunder, ending with the submersion of this Treasury of the Way.
* Showing all [signs] of extinction of substance, he effected this marvelous sign; With organs decaying in the body, warmth remained at the top of his head.

# Stūpa-Ode

* On a lofty cliff girdled by clear water, we engraved the stūpa and depicted the supernal appearance (*shenyi*).
* Form and name remain for ages; when the *kalpa* is exhausted, only then they responsively wane.
* Made on the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the third year of the Zhenguan 貞觀 era of the Great Tang (629).

# Interpreting the signs of death in order to predict future conditions was naturally a topic of considerable interest

* We are able to trace back one trail of pertinent references through Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji's commentary on the *Cheng weishi lun*:
* The *Treatise* [says]: "Further, when someone is about to die, coldness to the touch gradually rises." 
* Comment: In death one gradually abandons the consciousnesses. Both Vasubandhu and Asvabhāva's 無性 (450-530) *Shelun* 攝 論 say: "With good karma one grows cold from below. With evil karma one grows cold from above. This is how one distinguishes rebirth with a superior tendency (*shengqu*) from an evil tendency."
* The *Yogācāra* first section says, "Accordingly the descending or ascending cold reaches the heart; because this place initiates rebirth, it is the last to be abandoned."

# What about the reference to depicting Lingshen's "*shenyi*," that intriguing term for a responsive appearance previously discussed in Chapter Four?

* Like the practice of making mummified "flesh-body" icons, the practice of making statues of the deceased may have been initially conceived as marking the transmutation of practitioners who were thought to have passed a significant threshold on the path to buddhahood.
* Corpse exposure may have been taken as an indication of inclusion in this elite—or it may have been a bid for membership.

# Regarding a contiguous conjunction of shrine and image of the deceased, Sunkyung Kim surmises that the exquisite Middle Cave of Shanyingshan 善應 山


* dedicated by disciples of the "Northern branch" Dilun master Sengchou 僧 稠 (480-560), may have served not only as Sengchou's meditation cave but also as a resting place where his corpse was exposed for a year prior to cremation of his remains.
* Following Liu Shufen's arguments, Kim avers that this type of cave-interment for monks became common in the north in the late sixth century.

# Moreover, I am not convinced that Buddhists of the sixth century would have placed the body of a monk, however eminent, within a chamber elaborately carved with buddha images in order to let it decompose for a year.


* Alternatively, the cave could have served as a reliquary shrine for cremation ashes, as the Baoshan niches were designed to be.
* The cave's exquisitely carved images of rebirth in the Pure Land may have combined devotional and performative functions.

# What these aspirations had in common was reliance on the power of faith, repentance, and generosity, which could be enacted and also contacted in persons, images, and relics

* We may recall the *Jueding pini jing* claim that aspiring bodhisattvas attain the level of acceptance of non-production of dharmas by making the three extreme sacrifices of kingly throne, wife, and eyes.
* In Indian Buddhist literature giving away one's eyes, understood as an offering to be used as medicine, was a trope signifying the ultimate gift of one's own body for the sake of others.

# One common function in enshrinement of representations of the deceased at Baoshan and Shanyingshan may have been commemoration of the generous acts of the deceased


* ranging from copying scripture to offering the body to feed other beings.
* In the apotheosis of death, donors may become central figures, responsive appearances.

## Making Dharma Ancestors

* The earliest datable memorial niche on Baoshan is dedicated to Dharma Master Facheng (BS 61).
* The next niche with a legible date was dedicated about a year later (BS 3); it is in a similar style but carved on a different part of the mountain.
* The last *in-situ* datable niche is from the mid-eighth century, but collections of rubbings include inscriptions from as late as the fifteenth century.

##  Memorial Inscriptions and Likenesses

* Few of the remaining Baoshan mortuary figures have faces, having fallen prey to weather, vandalism, or the illegal trade in antiquities.
* Five inscriptions corroborate that likeness was desired in these mortuary figures.

## LFS 47: Dhyāna Master Sengshun (555-639)

* The inscription refers to carving the stone and modeling her form (*kanshi tuxing*) to pass down to successive generations.
* Sengshun's is the only inscription in the Baoshan corpus that directly refers to *linzang*.

## LFS 25: Dharma Master Huijing (573-641)

* The disciple Fayan twice cites his feelings of filiality toward his master as the motivation for making an image.
* He says that he "cremated the disconnected bones, respectfully moved the numinous ashes," this most likely refers to the *linzang* procedure mentioned in Sengshun's memorial.

## LFS 45: Dharma Master Puxiang (566-643)

* The inscription specifies that a stūpa was set up and a "*shenyi*" representation was included in the niche along with the inscription.
* There may have been a connection between the use of the term *shenyi* and Sanjie-related *linzang*.


## BS 106: Image stūpa for Dharma Master Zhan (644-686)

* This inscription includes a detailed description of the process: cremating the bones, making and dedicating a reliquary niche, and the inclusion of a portrait-image (*yingxiang*).
* The phrase "recalling and esteeming the karmic connection of his teachings" evokes this relationship.

## BS 110: Master ? (d. 723)

* Disciples cite "repaying kindness" in connection with having his image made.


##  Interpreting the Images

* Making forms of the "special dead" laid claim to special relationships and debts, implicating the images in Dharma and blood-kinships recorded across both mountains.
* Both texts and images tie the deceased into a "community of memory," which carried forward networks, hierarchies, and lineages. 
* The disciples' stated desire to maintain their connection with the deceased, in perpetuity, suggests that these representations supported both social reproduction and soteriological effect.

## Representations Of Donors

* Through Baoshan inscriptions, we glimpse the sentiments and motivations of donors, often expressing sorrow, gratitude, and filial feelings.
* Listing donor names on votive constructions was significant, intersecting with practices of including stylized representations of donors.
* Sponsorship of votive projects allowed Chinese Buddhists to participate in the field of merit and cultivate Buddhist social relations.

## Donor Representations in Buddhist Art

* Inserting inscriptional and visual representations of donors into dedicated votive installations became widespread.
* These donor inscriptions on Buddhist images were analogous to pre-Buddhist bronze vessels inscribed with records of sacrifices and achievements.
* Both types of work derived their value from their function within intricate systems of patterned gifting.

## Stelae as Donor Representations

* Dorothy Wong's work on early Chinese Buddhist stelae provides insights into Buddhist donors and what they wished to record.
* Patrons of stele-projects were often local devotional societies, taking on forms and functions of pre-Buddhist village associations.
* In northern dynasties, adoption of Buddhism provided social and political glue between Han descendants and foreign conquerors.

## The *Shaolinsi bei* Stele

* This Northern Qi-era stele provides a concrete sense of how devotees viewed their roles as individuals, members of subgroups, and a collective.
* Scriptural references included in the inscription suggest complementarity between human and supramundane offerings.
* Donor names are given designations for special roles like fundraiser, spiritual leader, and sponsor of consecration ceremonies.

## Individualization in Donor Images

* While donor images on stelae and murals are not portraits in the strictest sense, they convey individuation through visual markings of gender, age, dress, and ethnicity.
* Inscriptions offer further specificity with regard to names, dates, aspirations, and donations.
* These images represent individuals located within intersecting collectivities of clans, ethnic groups, social positions, and religious affiliations.

## Donor Portraits in Dunhuang Paintings

* Dunhuang scroll-paintings or banners typically feature salvific buddhas and bodhisattvas with representations of the principal donor and family members in a separate register.
* Some high-quality commissions contain actual portraits of the donor's face attached to a generic ink-outline figure.
* Stein Painting 14, dated 910, is notable for its individualized portrayals of the deceased siblings of the unnamed donor, identified as portraits (*maozhen*).



# Praise to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva

* The inscription dedicates the painting to Avalokiteśvara for the welfare of the empire and the deceased parents and elder sister/nun of the donor.
* The nun, identified as the donor's teacher, is mentioned before their parents. 
*  The painting portrays the nun, while the parents are not depicted.

# All Things Born Are Unstable

* This cartouche on the painting evokes Buddhist themes of salvation from impermanence.
* It emphasizes that good karma and deeds are impermanent unless transmuted by compassion.
* The inscription suggests that the portraits capture this transmutation into merit transfer, making them "true images."

# Turning the Painting Over

* The back of the painting features two inscriptions: one repeating the dedication to the deceased brother and another praising Avalokiteśvara.
* This second inscription mentions both the deceased nun and brother, highlighting their importance.
* It describes Avalokiteśvara's compassion and ability to rescue beings from suffering.

# The Nun as Mediator

* The painting depicts the nun Yanhui standing beside Avalokiteśvara, suggesting her role as a mediator.
* Her image is large and prominent, similar in size to the bodhisattva.
* This placement implies that she has achieved a level of spiritual attainment and can intercede for the deceased.


# Representations of the Deceased

* The inscriptions and images at Baoshan demonstrate how representations of the deceased functioned as mediators between the living and the beyond.
* These representations were constructed through conventional emotions, rhetoric, and artistic skill.
* They pointed to the impermanent nature of reality while also offering a sense of connection with the deceased.

# Chapter Seven A Niche Of Their Own

* Anonymity was not as important to women in the Tang Dynasty as it was to men.
* Despite Confucian codes restricting women, there is evidence of their agency through art and literature.
* Elite women enjoyed certain freedoms but were still bound by traditional roles.
* Buddhist nuns chose to renounce household life while supporting mainstream values.
* The Lanfengshan inscriptions provide a unique glimpse into the lives of these women.

# The Mortuary Grove At Lanfengshan

* Lanfengshan is a significant archaeological site with numerous inscriptions dedicated to Buddhist nuns.
* These inscriptions offer valuable insights into the lives and practices of Tang Dynasty women.
* The site stands out for its focus on female practitioners and their contributions.
* A large proportion of the inscriptions date back to the 7th century, highlighting the prominence of women in Buddhism during this period.
* Lanfengshan continued to attract female devotees even after the decline of the convents.

# Women And The Agency Of Relations

* This section explores the agency of Buddhist nuns in relation to their communities and families.
* It examines the creation of the nuns' community and early ordination practices.
* The discussion focuses on identifying female agency within pre-modern sources.
* It analyzes the various practice specializations available to nuns, with a particular emphasis on asceticism.
* The section also investigates the connections between nuns' natal families and their Buddhist roles, including filial devotion. 




## A Brief Account Of Buddhist Nuns

* Mahāprajāpatī Gotamī, the Buddha's aunt and foster mother, was the first Buddhist nun.
* Stories about her highlight the ambivalent feelings towards mothers and sons separating in Buddhism.
* She represents a debt owed to women for their caregiving roles.

## The Founding of the Nuns' Order

* Mahāprajāpatī requested the Buddha to ordain women as nuns (*bhikṣuṇī*).
* Initially, the Buddha refused but eventually agreed after Ānanda's intervention.
* Eight special rules were established to subordinate nuns to monks.

## Attitudes Towards Women in Buddhism

* Buddhist literature shows a growing trend of misogyny over time.
* Scholars attribute this to various factors like psychological issues, institutional growth, and economic pressures.
* Four "voices" regarding women in Buddhism have been identified: soteriological inclusiveness, institutional androcentrism, ascetic misogyny, and soteriological androgyny.

## The Status of Nuns in China

* Ordination requirements for nuns are more stringent than for monks in Theravada Buddhism.
* Zhu Jingjian became the first Chinese Buddhist nun in the 4th century despite controversy over the legitimacy of her ordination.
* A second group of Sinhalese nuns arrived in the 5th century, establishing a legitimate Chinese *bhikṣuṇī saṃgha*.

## Laywomen and Nuns

* In India, laywomen supported the *saṃgha* through devotional practice.
* Renouncing household life was seen as transgressive for women.
* In China, Confucian norms initially resisted Buddhist monasticism for women.
* Despite obstacles, nuns' communities thrived with support from elite women.

## Visibility of Nuns in Medieval Buddhism

* Evidence of nuns' activities is found in court records, inscriptions at Buddhist sites, and Dunhuang documents.
* The Baoshan site provides a valuable glimpse into the lives of medieval Buddhist nuns. 




## Active Voices

* Debate on female agency in East Asia has generated a subfield at the intersection of cultural and historical studies, sociology, and literary criticism. 
* Focusing on "agency of relations" can be more fruitful than comparing the scope for self-expressive individualism when studying gender in traditional cultures.
* Laying claim to a supporting role was a significant expression of agency for women at Baoshan.

## Female Chinese Buddhist Practitioners' Voices

* There is a growing body of work on female Chinese Buddhist practitioners' voices in later periods. 
* Studies reveal the extent of women's nuanced appropriations of conventions shaped by males.

## The Lanfengshan Inscriptions

* The Lanfengshan inscriptions reflect androcentric social and religious norms of the Tang.
* A memorial for a nun occupies a hybrid and subtly anomalous space, offering insights into reflexive constructions of gender.

## Images of Female Practitioners

* One must be aware of the ideological uses of images of female practitioners or exemplars. 
* Such images often serve as symbolic inversions to support claims for ultimate nondual awareness/reality.

## Assertive Female Agency

* Traces of assertive female agency in the historical record should not be erased.
* The case of two Tiantai nuns challenging a Chan master demonstrates how apparent female agency can still be that of the numinous or charismatic "hero."
* Images of the female disciples of Chan Master Wuzhu can be seen as an active appropriation of an emerging literary genre.

## Agency of Relations

* This study aims to establish provisional grounds for inquiry into premodern individual voices and literary conventions. 
* The agency of relations, manifested at Lanfengshan, involved conformity to well-established Buddhist programs and practices.

## Sanjie Movement

* The Sanjie movement effectively mobilized aggregate power by promoting donations as collective and eternal.
* It is possible that the Sanjie concept played a role in the mobilization of resources needed to create a mirror of Baoshan's necropolis on Lanfengshan.

## Significance of Lanfengshan

* The nuns' inscriptions, though reflecting male clan credit, have the potency of a compiled text with its own identity.
* They allow us to imagine a "Continued Lives of Eminent Nuns" comparable to Daoxuan's work.

## Practicing Women

* Sengshun's memorial highlights her commitment to asceticism, meditation, and study.
* She practiced austerity, visualized buddhas, and sought Dharma for over forty years.
* The inscription emphasizes her dedication to eliminating karmic ties and achieving enlightenment.
* It also mentions the challenging circumstances faced by women in Buddhist tradition, including the "five obstacles" and "three subordinations."

## Asceticism (*dhūta*)

* Sengshun's practices were particularly severe, including reducing her physical appearance (xiaorong).
* While extreme fasting was not a separate category for monks, it was popular in hagiographies.
* The *Biqiuni zhuan* lists hard ascetic practice as one of four exemplary practices for women.

## Meditation (*dhyāna*)

* Sengshun's memorial mentions her visualization of buddhas and her dedication to meditation.
* Meditation is also listed as an exemplary practice in the *Biqiuni zhuan*.


## Dharma

* Sengshun's commitment to spreading the Dharma is implied through her teachings and influence on her disciples.
* The *Biqiuni zhuan* includes spreading the Dharma as one of its four exemplary practices for women. 





## - Dhūta

* The results of austerities were visible through physical alterations, demonstrating supreme self-discipline.
*  The *Biqiuni zhuan* references to erudition often go hand-in-hand with references to strict vegetarianism and an ascetic lifestyle.
* Buddhist literature is full of accounts of extreme practices, as well as warnings against them.

## - Popular Stories vs. Orthodox Teaching

* Popular stories of nuns' feats of endurance or self-sacrifice countered the voice of moderation in Buddhist teachings.
* Sengshun's ability to "reduce her appearance" is an image of liberation from self, yet remained vulnerable to censure for departure from the Middle Way and attachment to a false, objectified notion of emptiness.

## - Chan Buddhism and Asceticism

* Chan Buddhists mocked denial of physicality as a delusion of reifying self-realization.
* Chan monks claimed a further "special transmission" and favored displays of subitist insight in iconoclastic or even transgressive behavior. 


## - Sengshun's Legacy

* A body subsisting on next-to-nothing visibly carried its own authority, conveying prestige within the community.
* Sengshun may have been considered an advanced bodhisattva, a conduit to the universal field of merit.
* Her self-expenditure is commemorated with some of the marks of a buddha image.
* The memorial emphasizes that she "visualized the buddhas, not separating autumn and winter" and "visualized the buddhas in the *bodhimaṇḍa*".
* These characterizations of her practice combined with depiction of a rosary seem to indicate unceasing buddha-evocation/contemplation (*buddhanāma* and buddhānusmṛti). 


## - Dhyāna

* Jinggan was a Dhyāna Master known for her profound meditation and scriptural recitation.
* Her memorial highlights her ascetic practices, including extreme fasting and enduring harsh conditions.
* She is described as having attained a state of "form like a withered tree, mind as if dead ashes," indicating a high level of spiritual attainment.
* Jinggan's life exemplifies the ideal of a Buddhist practitioner who dedicates herself to deep cultivation and embodies the principles of *dhyāna*.

## 




## - Dharma

* Puxiang was a highly respected nun who was known for her erudition and insight into Buddhist teachings.
* She was skilled in Vinaya texts, lectured on scriptures like the *Daśabhūmika* and the *Vimalakīrti*, and desired to spread the Dharma. 
* Her memorial inscription celebrates her enlightenment and emphasizes her ability to transcend worldly attachments.

## - Gendered Enlightenment

* The inscription's description of Puxiang's enlightenment as "without hearing" may be a trope used to describe Buddhist awakening, but its application to a woman raises questions about gendered assumptions in religious discourse.
* While some scholars suggest that women's religious experiences tend to be more "nondramatic" and "intimate," historical accounts demonstrate that women's spiritual journeys could be just as intense and dramatic as those of men.

## - Early Buddhist Accounts

* The *Therigatha*, a collection of poems by early Buddhist nuns, offers glimpses into the challenges and triumphs of female practitioners.
* The poem about nun Siha's near-suicide experience highlights the universal struggle with desire and the potential for enlightenment even in moments of extreme despair.
* These accounts challenge simplistic notions of gendered religious experience and reveal the complexity and diversity of Buddhist practice. 




# In the *Biqiuni zhuan*

* The most dramatic episodes involve women whose vocations are strengthened by surviving violent attacks.
* Examples include Zhixian resisting a rapist and Daozong enduring fiery auto-cremation.
* These stories highlight female resistance to violation and provide dramatic scope.

# Whether the reference to Puxiang's enlightenment is read as a trope or a dramatic validation of her Buddhist practice

* The very uselessness of a nun's enlightenment sets it apart.
* A nun's enlightenment was "non-progressive" and had no ongoing function in the self-legitimating processes of Buddhist male monastic reproduction.

# Monastic structures and customs helped shape and assimilate individual experiences

* At Baoshan, a nun's realization could only temporarily augment the male saṃgha.
* No matter how far a nun's prestige reached, it would not win her a place in the annals of transmission of the Dharma.

# Notably, the Lanfengshan inscriptions do not seem to have been reproduced in textual form

* Selections from the Baoshan monk's memorials are included in the *Quan Tang wen* and *Anyangxian jinshi lu*.
* Such inscriptions written by male disciples became the raw material for Dharma lineages and transmission histories.

# Localized fields of practice like small shrines and convents may be valorized as counterbalancing large-scale "patriarchal" institutions

* Yet on whose grounds could we assess whether this seventh-century memorialization of Puxiang's enlightenment was subservient to the status quo, self-serving, or subversive?

# Sengshun's *dhūta* austerities, Jinggan's obdurate state in *dhyāna*, and the pursuit of Dharma claimed for all three nuns were attributes with time-honored value

* The reference to Puxiang's enlightenment alludes to the sense-transcending lack of the experiencing subject herself.
* Her disciples lamented the evanescence of her works compared to the self-replenishing verdure of nature.




## Family Ties Dharma Economics

* Activating an "agency of relations" by combining family interests and Dharma interests was crucial to the creation and maintenance of Buddhist practicescapes.
* This view is supported by inscriptions and colophons which provide evidence for the persistence of monastics' family entanglements. 

## The Deployment of Alliance and Sexuality

* Chinese Buddhist mortuary inscriptions tend to "deploy alliance," first locating the deceased within a patrilinear family and then providing a more extensive account of a Dharma family or network.
* In the Baoshan/Lanfengshan inscriptions, references to regional and family alliances at the beginning and grieving Dharma companions at the end serve as frames for the "portrait" of the deceased's embodiment of Buddhist virtues.

## The Economic Effects of Celibacy

*  Monastic norms idealized elimination of desires and intimate attachments, while Mahāyāna doctrine stressed devotional and ritual transmutation of personal relationships into universal compassion.
* In both India and China, celibacy became a key means to mark an identity that was first and foremost Buddhist, transcending regional, cultural, ethnic and family identities.

## Symbolic Capital and the Buddhist Economy

*  Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's *The Logic of Practice*, we could view the socioeconomic link between money-making and Buddhism in terms of 
"symbolic capital."
* The clergy were instrumental in developing "protocapitalist" functions in medieval Chinese economic networks.

## Monasteries as Economic Agents

* Temples functioned as early banking institutions: they offered loans at interest, maintained a storehouse of liquid assets, and held goods and cash on deposit for traveling merchants.
* Monks and nuns could function as mediators in various ways. While they were symbolically independent and to varying degrees economically independent of traditional family ties, they also continued to be part of their natal families and networks.

## The Persecution of Buddhism

* Censure of worldly monastics and wealthy monasteries was a continuous theme from the very beginnings of Buddhism in China.
* Buddhist institutions were dealt devastating blows under the Huichang 會昌 era persecution (844-846) of Emperor Wu 武.


## Merit as Symbolic Capital

* "Merit" could be considered an ideal representation of the mediating and rationalizing functions necessary for the Tang expansion of industry, international trade, and commerce.
* For those venturing to do business and extend credit beyond their local networks, the assurance of shared investment in a system of impersonal retribution and redemption helped to manage risk.

# Merit-Transfer and Social Capital

* Merit-transfer allows good deeds to become permanent assets that transcend the Triple World.
* It dwarfs traditional symbolic capital by offering guarantees of an afterlife utopia with unlimited wealth, honor, and status.
* Merit-transfer enables social and familial network maintenance while engaging in spiritual capitalization.

# Visual Representations of a Better Life

* Buddhist texts and images depict Maitreya's city and Amitābha's court, promising wealth and distinction to all.
* The fear of falling into lower rebirths due to karma is also emphasized.
* The *Zhancha shan'e yebao jing* provides a method for predicting karmic retribution based on past actions.

# Buddhist-Daoist Imaginaire and Afterlife Processes

* A vivid Buddhist-Daoist imaginaire depicts an unforgiving underworld bureaucracy and levels of hell.
* This imaginaire reflects one's karmic condition, not separate worlds.
* Buddhist works assure devotees that lack of accountability in life will be redressed in the afterlife.

# Savior Figures and Mediation

* "Great bodhisattvas" mediate the universal laws of karma, offering personal forms of mediation.
* Maitreya welcomes devotees to his heaven, Avalokiteśvara aids those in distress, and Kṣitigarbha intercedes for those in hell.
* Monks and nuns also act as salvific agents, connecting various levels of spiritual, economic, social, and family enterprise.

# Nuns And Household Economies

* Nuns' subordination of kinship responsibilities allowed them a unique role in medieval Chinese households.
* They often remained involved with their natal families, unlike married daughters whose loyalties shifted to their husbands' families.
* Nuns generated merit and were a credit to the family without demanding resources or laying claim to clan assets.

# Nuns as Creditors and Benefactors

* Nuns could be creditors for their families due to their *saṃgha* status.
* They produced goods like silk embroidery, earning further merit.
* As outsiders to the family, they were not competing claimants to resources but could deploy their merit to benefit their kin.

## Daughters In Chinese Buddhism

* Several laywomen memorialized on Lanfengshan are identified as mothers of the nuns who dedicated the niches.
* These laywomen are portrayed similarly to idealized women seen in Tang tomb figurines and murals.
* One niche depicts a figure possibly representing a nun and her mother, highlighting kinship rather than non-attachment.

## - Zhijue'S Memorial For Her Father

* The memorial was dedicated by the nun Zhijue for her father Sun Baiyue in 646.
* Zhijue defied her family's wish to have her father buried in the family tomb, instead cremating him and enshrining his ashes in a stūpa.
* This act reflects their shared Buddhist faith and desire for a pure life.
* Zhijue likely wrote the memorial herself, demonstrating literacy skills despite the scarcity of surviving Tang compositions by women.

## - Chan Master Wuzhu'S Dharma Daughters

* Questions of literary authority are central to understanding Buddhist daughters in this text.
* The *Lidai fabao ji* is written by unnamed disciples of Chan/Zen Master Wuzhu and may have been authored by his female disciples.
* This text provides glimpses of Buddhist women, including the first record of Chan nuns.

## Women in the *Lidai fabao ji*

* Women appear unexpectedly in key events in Chan history.
* A nun is introduced as one of Bodhidharma's closest disciples.
* Empress Wu Zetian receives Bodhidharma's robe of transmission, then passes it to another teacher.
* Wuzhu's master's sister slashed her face to maintain chastity, inspiring him to become a monk.

## Wuzhu and His Female Disciples

* Changjingjin is identified as the daughter of Administrator Murong and becomes a disciple after hearing Wuzhu speak.
* Liaojianxing, Changjingjin's cousin, also becomes a disciple after hearing Wuzhu speak.
* Both women are described as intelligent and devoted to their practice.
* They renounce marriage and become leaders among nuns.

## Possible Authorship and Connections

* If one or both of these women authored the *Lidai fabao ji*, it sheds light on its portrayal of women.
* Liaojianxing's noble lineage and intellectual capacities are emphasized, suggesting a possible connection to Su Ting, a famous literatus.
* Liaojianxing may have been related to Wei Dan, an official memorialized by Han Yu.

## Ren and the *Lidai fabao ji*

* Ren, wife of Cui Gan, is mentioned in the *Lidai fabao ji*.
* She is portrayed as a devoted Buddhist and plays a role in Wuzhu's descent from his mountain retreat.
* Her inclusion highlights the unique portrayal of a devoted Dharma family in the text.

## Unique Features of the *Lidai fabao ji*

* The text showcases loving snapshots of Wuzhu, revealing his wit and occasional ill-humor.
* It portrays Wuzhu's community as a small, close-knit, and unorthodox family.
* Encounters with followers and challengers are more quirky and personal than later Chan stories.

## - Layman Pang'S Daughter

* The text focuses on Layman Pang Yun and his daughter Lingzhao as examples of Chan Buddhism in practice.
* Layman Pang exemplifies the Chan ideal of achieving enlightenment outside of a monastic setting, living a life of voluntary poverty with his family.
* Episodes featuring Lingzhao demonstrate how filial affection is transformed into Chan realization through unconventional actions and dialogues.

* Lingzhao's final act of dying before her father showcases her mastery of Chan principles and her ultimate commitment to their shared path.


## - Conclusion

* This section analyzes three stories of Buddhist daughters and fathers, highlighting how they renegotiate social conventions and Buddhist practices.
* Zhijue's devotion to her father and his lay Buddhist practice led her to challenge Confucian burial customs and advocate for the equality of lay and monastic practice.
* Changjingjin and Liaojianxing's instant recognition of Wuzhu as their teacher exemplifies the sudden awakening characteristic of Chan Buddhism, transcending traditional kinship ties through shared commitment to no-thought practice.

* Lingzhao's playful mastery of Chan teachings demonstrates that anyone can achieve enlightenment, regardless of gender or social status.


## - The Literary Lives Of Nuns

* This section focuses on two poems inscribed on the memorial niche for the nun Benxing, potentially written by her or another nun from the Baoshan community.
* These poems offer a rare glimpse into the literary expressions of Tang Buddhist nuns, exploring themes of impermanence, self-reflection, and the need for Buddhist practice.

* The analysis compares these poems to works by other female writers, including Empress Wu and Daoist adepts, highlighting the unique tensions and intersections between Buddhist aspirations and Chinese poetic traditions.
* The scarcity of surviving poems by Tang Buddhist nuns compared to Daoist female practitioners raises questions about the preservation and representation of different religious experiences in literature.

## The Benxing Poems

* The poems use poetic conventions but are unique within the context of Baoshan memorials.
* They offer insight into the devotional practices of Baoshan nuns, including commemorating the deceased, recording merit, chanting scripture, and sermonizing.
* The poems provide a glimpse into the concerns and aspirations of a female Buddhist practitioner in Tang dynasty China.

## Sengshun's Memorial

* It is the earliest datable record among Lanfengshan's collection of nun memorials (640).

## Benxing's Memorial

* It is the last datable record in the collection (676).
* It includes a eulogy expressing grief and reminding readers of their mortality.
* Two poems are inscribed on the memorial, likely composed by or for Benxing.

## Analysis of the Poems

* The poems have a didactic tone, aiming to inspire Buddhist practice.
* They blend Buddhist concepts with Chinese notions of the afterlife, using imagery like the separation of the soul into hun and po elements.
* The poems express a somber view of death, emphasizing the impermanence of worldly pleasures and the cycle of rebirth.

## Comparison with Other Death Poems

* Huixu's poem (5th century) also addresses the evanescence of worldly pleasures but with a more jaunty tone.
* Lingyu's death poems (early Tang) share the Benxing poems' helplessness in the face of death, but use macabre imagery and irony.

## Buddhist Subjectivities

* The author explores the nature of subjectivity in the Benxing poems, drawing comparisons with traditional Chinese beliefs about the afterlife. 
* The poems depict a sense of loneliness and ambiguity in the afterlife, contrasting with the hopeful imagery of salvation found in other Buddhist texts.
* The text analyzes the tension between buddha-nature and human nature, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding both the goal and means of achieving enlightenment in the Benxing poems.

## Practicing Poetesses

* This section examines poems by Buddhist and Daoist practitioners within the context of Tang poetic aesthetics. 
* It draws on Pauline Yu's work to explore the relationship between devotional and personal poetry, particularly within a "literature of the beyond."
* The author investigates the reasons behind the scarcity of poems attributed to Buddhist nuns compared to those by Daoist women.
* This section also compares and contrasts the Benxing poems with works by Daoist female practitioners. 




## - Buddhists

* The sole poem attributed to a nun in the *Quan Tang shi* provides insight into Buddhist-inflected poetry.
* Haiyin's *Zhou Ye* (A Night on a Boat) uses emotionally charged tropes common in Tang poetry, but lacks explicitly Buddhist elements. 
* Pauline Yu argues that by the ninth century, a Buddhist sense of emptiness and impermanence had influenced poetic sensibilities generally.

## -  Poetry and Buddhism

* Yu contrasts Chinese expressive-affective conceptions of poetry with Western mimetic-allegorical roots.
* She links the Chinese mode to notions of virtue and harmony, where poetry acts as a "tuning-string for the cosmos."
* This resonates with Buddhist ideas about resonance (*yinggan*) and the efficacy of devotional practice.

## -  Verse in Mahāyāna Scriptures

* Verse in scriptures like the *Lotus Sūtra* illustrates narratives and glorifies the Buddha, but treats emotions other than devotion and compassion as hindrances.
* Chinese poetry, however, uses verse for resonance and transformation of conditions, seeing sorrow as a reflection of virtue.


## -  Buddhist Influences on Poetry

* Yu argues that Wang Wei's Buddhist inclinations deepened Tang court poetry with emotional and philosophical depth.
* Eighth-century Chan Buddhist meditations on emptiness/transcendence provided new modes of evoking stimulus-response.
* However, the importance of sixth- and seventh-century Buddhist morality and repentance should not be overlooked.

## -  Haiyin's Poem

* Haiyin's poem echoes eighth-century Chan writers who claimed recognition of emptiness/interdependence comes through transformative experience.
* Her emphasis on abstract qualities like "color" and "sound" reflects nonduality and interdependence.
* While the poem is not explicitly Buddhist, her identity as a nun colors its aesthetic of the "beyond," where the poet's voice fades into the natural world.

## -  Buddhist Nuns and Poetry

* The *Quan Tang shi* includes only one poem by a Buddhist nun, raising questions about gendered identity and self-transformative practice.
* While Buddhist monks were valued participants in poetic culture, nuns were less visible.
* This lone poem offers a glimpse into the complex relationship between Buddhism, gender, and literary expression in Tang China.

## - Daoists

* Poems by female Daoist practitioners are more numerous than those by Buddhist nuns.
* This may be because Buddhism emphasized karmic afflictions, leaving less room for women to circumvent social restrictions.
* Daoism allowed for the veneration of goddesses and a sublimated eroticism that resonated with some Tang poetry.
* Female Daoists could attain transcendence and hold important roles like keepers of celestial archives and teachers of male adepts.

## - Conclusions

* The eulogies for Sengshun, Jinggan, Puxiang, and Benxing highlight the importance of self-mastery in their community.
* While literary skill was valued, spectacular asceticism that reshaped their bodies and deaths was considered the most prized accomplishment.
* The Benxing poems demonstrate the Buddhist tradition of using poetry as a means of cultivation and reflecting on one's character.
* The portrait-statues of these nuns depict them engaged in writing and copying scripture, emphasizing their commitment to accumulating merit.
* Despite the lack of explicit gender markers in the Benxing poems, their context reveals the nuns' agency in shaping their own representation and purpose.
* The nuns' practices reveal a tension between the desire for self-transcendence and the unstable subjectivity that this pursuit creates.

## Huixiu'S Memorial

* This memorial is dedicated to Dharma Master Huixiu, a prominent monk of his time.
* It consists of three parts: a dedication inscription, a stūpa-ode by Lingfan, and an eulogy by Song Bao on behalf of Li Zhen, Prince of Yue.

## Ta Song 塔頌 (Stūpa Ode) 

* The ode describes Huixiu as a brilliant teacher who illuminated the world with his knowledge.
* It highlights his dedication to studying Buddhist scriptures and his ability to explain complex teachings clearly.
* The ode expresses sorrow at Huixiu's passing and praises his contributions to Buddhism.

## Cirun si gu da lunshi *Huixiu fashi keshi [...] ji dewen* 慈潤寺故大論師慧休法師 刻石 (□?) 記德文 (Engraved [...] "recording merit" epitaph for the late great Treatise Master of Cirun monastery, Dharma Master Huixiu)

* This section provides biographical information about Huixiu's life and lineage.
* It details his early interest in Buddhism, his rigorous training under various masters, and his extensive scholarship.
* The text praises Huixiu's profound understanding of Buddhist teachings and his ability to explain them clearly.

## Zhao jingxing 昭景行 (Illuminating Noble Conduct)

* This eulogy was commissioned by Li Zhen, Prince of Yue, who considered Huixiu a pillar of Buddhism.
* It emphasizes Huixiu's virtuous character, his dedication to the Buddha-Dharma, and his impact on countless beings.
* The text expresses deep respect for Huixiu's accomplishments and mourns his loss. 




## Recall that one transmigrates in the Triple-World

* One drowns in the four kinds of birth or sinks in the river of love without dread. 
* One plays in the burning house without alarm if consciousness is not awakened to true and false.
* Awareness is always confused about movement and stillness, how [...] of great awakening, [...] the great Dharma of the great chiliocosm?

## He manifested the delight of the three vehicles

* Actualized the field of merit in the six realms [of rebirth]. 
* Even if the sun of wisdom was quickly hidden, the torch of wisdom is still passed down. 
* The responsive traces of that superior person, the legacy of his unimpeded profound words open the gate of the nondual Dharma and explicate the subtle principle of subsuming the three [vehicles into one Buddha-vehicle].

## He was endowed with an impressive manner

* Had the capacity to save beings, his faith was exceptional and held in the highest regard.
* His passing is but the impermanence of conditioned phenomena, ultimately [...] tranquil nirvāṇa. 

## Pained that the words of the Sage would fade

* We have carved the dark stone and recorded his merits; although tombs shift and seas change, grant that his excellent reputation be not cut off.

## Composed by the Imperial Tutor Song Bao

* Instructor in the household of the Prince of Yue.
* The *Stūpa Ode* by the disciple Lingfan is a personal tribute, one that could also speak for others who were close to the Master in life and death. 

## This apparently first-hand description

* Of Huixiu's final offering is followed by the elegant memorial and eulogy by the Imperial Tutor Song Bao, who includes anecdotes about Huixiu's vigilance in caring for the monks and even the insects who lived within his sphere of influence at Baoshan. 
* Nearly contemporaneously, Daoxuan's extensive entry for Huixiu in the Xu gaoseng zhuan may have drawn from this memorial but is considerably more detailed.

## Differences between Song Bao's and Daoxuan's accounts

* Are too numerous to discuss in full, but we might note the following salient contrasts.
* Song Bao's memorial provides an illustrious noble lineage, while Daoxuan's biography sketches the romantic image of a young boy in a remote seacoast village, pining for a purer life and lamenting his family occupations of fishing and sericulture.

## The memorial uses elegant classical allusions

* To suggest an early vocation and scriptural education, while the biography describes the galvanizing effect of a public sermon on the sufferings of *saṃsāra* delivered by an itinerant monk.
* The biography cites training and ordination under Vinaya Master Xu 勗 and subsequent training under Lingyu, while the memorial claims his first training was under Lingyu and he subsequently studied the Vinaya under Vinaya Master Sengshu 僧樹.

## Daoxuan claims that Huixiu engaged in a period of intensive contemplative-exegetical practice

* To realize "ultimate principle" (*zhili* 至理). He specifies *tathāgatagarbha* soteriology in terms that suggest the Dasheng qixin lun, a text not referenced at Baoshan: "Not leaving off night or day, in seclusion he sought essential nature (*tixing* 體性)."

## According to Daoxuan, Huixiu's study and questioning culminated

* In a definitive awakening experience. Song Bao celebrates Huixiu's numerous followers in poetic phrases, comparing them to "ten thousand streams returning to the Gulf of Bo."

## He provides a detailed list of Huixiu's works

* Including a commentary on the Chengshi lun. Daoxuan does not provide a list of works, and while he also mentions the Gulf of Bo, he claims Huixiu went there to study the *Chengshi* lun with Dharma Master Mingyan 明彥, who was known for his expertise on this text.

## He also mentions a period of study with Mingyan's disciple Zhinian 志念

* Daoxuan echoes Song Bao's phrases about Huixiu's many students, but he also casts aspersions on mere literary study.
* He claims Huixiu was still dissatisfied and wanted to understand Yogācāra (Weishi 惟識) doctrines, which was a motivation to study with Lingyu and work on the Mahāyānasaṃgraha-śāstra with Tanqian and Treatise Master Ni 尼.

## However, Daoxuan claims that it was not until Huixiu left theoretical discussion

* Turned to serious study of the *Dharmagupta Vinaya* (Daoxuan's own affiliation), and undertook repentance practice that he understood the principle of all the scriptures.
* Daoxuan then turns to accounts of Huixiu's feats and miracles, including a dramatic story of pacification of bandits as well as the fire-prevention episode cited by Song Bao.

## Daoxuan praises Huixiu's austere and pure lifestyle

* Echoing the epitaph's phrases about solicitude for insects and adding other details like going barefoot and begging for his food. 
* Daoxuan says he was "entrusted to the quiet forest" at Baoshan, also alluding to corpse exposure. He designates Lingfan as Huixiu's main disciple, claiming that Lingfan followed in his master's footsteps but did not match his insight.

## The biography closes with mention of imperial honors

* Presumably referring to the Prince of Yue's patronage. Daoxuan thus hightlights Huixiu's path in the continuum of a busy Dharma-network, and portrays him as an exemplar whose mature Vinaya practice and austerities outshone the exegetical pursuits of his early years.


## In the Baoshan epitaph

* On the other hand, we may discern the twilight of one soteriological era and the dawning of another. The first line of Lingfan's Stūpa Ode alludes to Baoshan's formative ethos or pathos, the passing of the Buddha-Dharma. 
* At Dazhusheng cave, eternal cosmic buddha-responsiveness is the promised refuge, but in the ode for Huixiu it is the human master's light that alleviates the darkness of the Buddha's absence: "Since the radiance of the Buddha-sun has been submerged, the illuminatus responds appropriately to the world." (佛日潛暉明人應世.)

## A line in Song Bao's concluding eulogy again takes up the theme

* Of the setting of the Buddha-sun, and again shifts focus away from final-age darkness toward the light of those who transmit the Dharma: "Even if the sun of wisdom was quickly hidden, the torch of wisdom is still passed down." (雖慧日之蹔隱乃慧炬而猶傳.)

## These lines reassure the mourners that the Buddha-sun of Huixiu's wisdom will shine on in subsequent disciples.


## Dazhusheng cave enshrines both endings and eternity

* The absolute and inconceivably bright sun of Vairocana is its central image. This contrasts with and accentuates the dimming of Śākyamuni's Dharma that gradually wanes like the moon or the human body, as described by Bodhisattva Moon-Embryo in the Candragarbha-*sūtra* on the opposite wall.
* Above the cave entrance, it is promised that refuge in the Three Treasures permeates all times and realms.

## Yet the inner wall depicts the end of the line of monks who transmitted Śākyamuni's Dharma

* While the cave enshrines the Dharma-sun and its reflection in the waning moon of our Dharma-era, the inscriptions for Huixiu and his fellow inhabitants of the necropolis offer refuge in guiding illumination close at hand.
* As individual niches multiplied and survived the vicissitudes of time, the lights of the necropolis spread. In time, it became known as the place of "Ten Thousand Buddhas."

## As one of the early lamps in this buddha-field

* Huixiu is shown dedicating himself to the life of the mind, the lives of the monks in his care, and the living beings in the monastery garden. These elements combine to make the image enshrined in word and stone into a human refuge, one who is eminent but not inconceivable.
* At the same time, it was his reputation for exegetical brilliance that won him a lasting niche in Chinese Buddhist genealogies.

## In reconstructions of a Shelun lineage

* Huixiu has been seen as a link between the Dilun branch of Huiguang-Daoping-Lingyu and the Shelun branch of Tanqian, based on the fact that the non-extant commentaries attributed to him were on works central to both exegetical trends.
* The work of Huixiu's probable collaborator Huiyuan also synthesized these trends.

## At Lanfengshan, however, Huixiu's closest fellow practitioners through the centuries have been nuns and laywomen


* To get to Huixiu's imperial memorial one walks through the funerary grove for nuns, passing chiseled names and faces as well as blank stone and empty niches. One also walks, with difficulty, through the descendants of the formidable thorns he once cleared with his clippers.

## In these chapters, we have followed Huixiu and his fellow practitioners

* As they made mountains into practicescapes, marked endtime with repeated repentances, worked through the agency of relations, theorized and debated, handled the potent power of images, and listened to the sounds of practicing women.
* The paths of this meshwork crisscross, disappear, and lead to unexpected niches. The practicescape is a reliquary that belongs to its own time, but what it contains is still volatile and responds "appropriately" to those who have sought contact with it through the ages.

## As in Daoxuan's time, people still go there "to seek the meaning of its texts." Its traces still move people. It is still relevant.




## The Image And The Work Of Mourning

* Derrida's work explores the practices of mourning across cultures and times, highlighting both continuities and differences. 
* He focuses on Louis Marin's concept of the "self-deconstructive nature" of mourning and proposes a "law of mourning": success comes through failure.
* The impossible choice in mourning is between appropriating the loved one's voice (narcissism) or refraining (betrayal).
* Mourning is an aporia, working at its own unproductivity, confronting the paradox of death as absolute force and utter helplessness.

## Part Ii: Baoshan Photos And Inscriptions

* This section details the transcription process used for inscriptions found on Baoshan, including a list of illustrations.
* It presents transcribed and translated inscriptions from three locations: Dazhusheng cave, memorial niches on Baoshan, and Daliusheng cave with niches on Lanfengshan. 




## Transcription Process And Conventions

* The text was produced by converting inscriptions from *BSLQS* into digital format and correcting them manually.
* Simplified character versions in *BSLQS* were often faulty or incomplete, necessitating corrections.
* In situ transcriptions were made in July 2005 with the help of Shen Ruiwen and Wang Jing.

* Photographs were taken in 2005 by Frederick Smith and the author.
* Information on niche orientations and height was taken from *BSLQS*.
* Four other sources for Baoshan texts were consulted: *AYXJSL*, *QTW*, Ōuchi 1997, and Li 1998.

* The author primarily followed in situ corrections but supplemented characters from other sources when necessary.
* Lacunae sometimes made it difficult to determine the number of missing characters.
* For long scriptural passages, the corresponding *Taishō* text is cited instead of including the full Chinese text.

* The author argues that suggesting possible words or phrases for inscriptions with many lacunae is relevant.
* Translations aim for consistency but may vary depending on context.

* Conventions used in the transcription:
    * ( ) in Chinese text: characters supplemented from other sources
    * ( ) in translations: supplementary explanatory meanings implied in the text
    * [ ] in Chinese text: surmised characters
    * [ ] in translations: supplementary words or phrases not in the text
    * □ : lacuna due to damage, blank stone

* (?) : illegible character
* (Character + ?) : partially legible character
