    *  Provides a table of abbreviations used for referencing Buddhist texts. 

# Abstrct

* This work articulates and defends a single thesis: that the Early Buddhist Texts originated in the lifetime of the Buddha or a little later, because they were, in the main, spoken by the Buddha and his contemporary disciples.
    * States the central argument of the work.
* Our argument covers two main areas: 1. The grounds for distinguishing the Early Buddhist Texts (s) from later Buddhist literature; 2. The evidence that the s stem from close to the Buddha's lifetime, and that they were generally spoken by the historical Buddha.
    * Outlines the two main points of the argument.
* Most academic scholars of Early Buddhism cautiously affirm that it is possible that the s contain some authentic sayings of the Buddha. We contend that this drastically understates the evidence. A sympathetic assessment of relevant evidence shows that it is *very likely* that the bulk of the sayings in the s that are attributed to the Buddha were actually spoken by him. It is *very unlikely* that most of these sayings are inauthentic.
    * Highlights the difference between the authors' view and the prevailing academic opinion on the authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts.

# Ntroduction

* Questions about the authenticity of Early Buddhist Texts (s) have often been debated without conclusive answers.
* This survey aims to systematically investigate the evidence for the authenticity of the s.
* The argument rests on two main points: the existence of a distinct body of Early Buddhist Texts and their origin from a single historical figure, the Buddha.

# 0.1 Definitions

* Authenticity refers to texts whose provenance aligns with their claimed origins. In this context, it means that texts attributed to the Buddha and his disciples were indeed spoken by them.
* Early Buddhist Texts encompass Suttas in Pali Nikāyas and parallel Āgama literature, *pātimokkhas*, some Vinaya material, and portions of the Khuddaka Nikāya.

# 0.2 Thesis

* Most s are authentic.
* The s underwent editing and arrangement over centuries after the Buddha's death, with changes primarily focusing on details rather than doctrine.
* Inauthentic portions within these texts can generally be identified.
* This thesis is supported by a substantial body of empirical evidence.
* Denial of authenticity stems from excessive skepticism rather than evidence. 




## 0.3 Timeine

* **480:** Birth of the Buddha.
* **400:** Parinibbāna.
* **399:** First Council.
* **397+:** Ctesias writes his Indika.
* **c. 350:** Sutta with King Muṇḍa (AN 5:50/EĀ 32.7); may mark final date acknowledged in s.
* **?–322:** Nanda dynasty. First "historical" dynasty in India. Mentioned in Greek writings.
* **326:** Alexander the Great in India.
* **322–298:** Candagutta reigns as first pan-Indian emperor.
* **305:** Seleucus defeated by Candagutta.
* **300:** Second Council.

## 1.1 Poitic Eorphy

* The political situation depicted in the s is completely transformed less than a century later.
* The political geography of Northern India changed rapidly after the period described in the s.
* The s must consequently belong to a period of history at least several decades prior to the reign of the Nandas. 

## 1.1.1 Mesthenes

* Megasthenes describes an India that is significantly developed from the depiction in the s.
* He describes the powerful kingdom of Magadha, with its magnificent capital Pāṭaliputta.
* Megasthenes does not refer directly to Buddhism, but does notice the *samaṇas* and brahmans.

## 1.1.2 The Expnsion Of The Known Word

* The s refer almost exclusively to the "Middle Country" around the Ganges plain.
* By the time of Candagutta there was a much wider knowledge of the civilised world.
* South India and Sri Lanka are not mentioned at all and appear to be unknown in the s.
* By the time of Candagutta, the known world had expanded to include Sri Lanka and South India, and possibly Burma.

## 1.1.3 Greek Connections

* The Greeks are largely unknown in the Suttas.
* There is only one known reference to the Greeks in the Suttas, which mentions their different social structure compared to Indians.
* This mention might be a later interpolation.
* Despite limited contact during the Buddha's time, sources suggest interaction between Greeks and Indians existed even earlier.
* Candagutta's reign marks a period of close contact with the Greeks.

## 1.1.4 The 16 Nations Become Part Of The Magadha Empire

* The Suttas depict Northern India divided into 16 nations (mahājanapadas) during the Buddha's time.
* This political landscape changed rapidly, with Magadha unifying most of North and Central India under the Nanda dynasty within a few decades after the Buddha's death.
* The Nandas' empire extended as far as the Beas River in the northwest and encompassed Kaliṅga in the east.
* This expansion is supported by both Buddhist and Hindu sources, indicating the disappearance of the 16 nations before Alexander's invasion.

## 1.1.5 The Transformation Of Pāṭaliputta

* Pāṭaliputta, the capital of Candagutta and Asoka, is only mentioned as a small village in the Suttas.
* Archaeological evidence suggests large-scale urban development in the Ganges plain began around the 4th century BCE.
* The Suttas mention Pāṭaliputta being built towards the end of the Buddha's life, predicting its future greatness.
* By Candagutta's time, Pāṭaliputta was a major city and the capital of Magadha according to Greek and Indian sources.
* Archaeological excavations at Patna/Pāṭaliputta support this historical account.

## 1.1.6 Absence Of Cndutt Nd Asok

* Candagutta and Asoka are not mentioned in the s, despite being significant rulers.
* This absence is noteworthy considering how frequently kings are mentioned in the s.
* The earliest mention of Candagutta in Pali literature is found in the Milindapañha.
* Asoka's life is described extensively in other Buddhist sources but not in the s.

## 1.1.7 No Contrdictory Evidence

* It is unlikely that ancient monks could have composed such a vast scripture without introducing errors or inconsistencies.
* There is no reliable evidence contradicting the picture presented in the s.
* The s accurately depict the political situation of the time, unlike other Buddhist literature which often contains factual inaccuracies.

## 1.2 Soci Conditions

* The s depict the emergence of moderate-sized urban centers, representing a stage between purely agrarian societies and the large cities of the Mauryan empire.
* Unlike earlier texts like the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, the s portray an urban lifestyle with flourishing trade.
* The s describe regional development and struggles between kings, a phenomenon not found in earlier literature.

## 1.3 Economic Conditions Nd Trde

* Trade in the s is primarily limited to the Ganges plain, unlike the extensive international trade during the Mauryan period.
* Luxury goods were often produced locally, suggesting limited long-distance trade due to political divisions.
* There is only one mention of seagoing merchants in the s, indicating minimal maritime trade at the time.

## 1.4 The Univers Monrch

* The concept of the "Universal Monarch" (Cakkavatti) in the s predates Asoka's reign.
* This ideal likely derives from the ancient Brahmanical Horse Sacrifice (*aśvamedha*), which established sovereignty over a vast territory.
* The Buddha adapted this Vedic myth, removing its violent aspects and emphasizing righteous rule.
* Parallels between the Cakkavatti and the Horse Sacrifice include symbolic imagery related to horses, sons, wheels, and cosmic power.

## 1.5 Writin

* Writing was unknown in the Suttas but appears later in Vinaya texts.
* Archaeological evidence suggests writing emerged after the Buddha, possibly during the Asokan period.
* Accounts from Megasthenes and Nearchos offer conflicting information about writing's presence in India around the time of Candagutta (100 years after the Buddha).
* Most scholars agree that there is no certain evidence for writing before Asoka but disagree on whether it existed at all.

## 2.1 Contct With Other Reiions

* The Suttas frequently depict the Buddha engaging in dialogues with non-Buddhists and skeptics, unlike other Buddhist texts which primarily focus on Buddhists speaking to each other.
* This difference suggests that the Suttas largely stem from the Buddha's life, a time when he was actively persuading others to his path.

## 2.2 Jinism

* Buddhism and Jainism share substantial similarities, placing both teachers in the same historical period (pre-Mauryan).
* Both traditions depict their respective founders as contemporaries of each other.
* Similarities include: criticism of animal sacrifice, ideas about karma, importance of generosity, social stratification, shared stories, similes, vocabulary, and verses.

## 2.3 Brhmnism

* The Suttas depict Brahmanical religion around the 5th century BCE, distinct from earlier and later forms.
* They only mention three Vedas, are unaware of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, and portray uncertainty among Brahmans characteristic of early Upaniṣads.
* The Suttas lack references to Pāṇini and many deities/practices found in later Hinduism.

## 2.4 The Unity Of Buddhism

* The Suttas show no evidence of distinct Buddhist sects, suggesting they were finalized before the emergence of sectarianism around the time of Asoka.
* Post-Asokan literature like the Kathāvatthu is where true sectarianism is first mentioned.



# Textu Trnsmission

* The Suttas have undergone remarkably accurate textual transmission over almost 2,500 years.

## 3.1 Comprtive Studies

* The s are varying recensions of the same body of texts because they stem from a period before Buddhism split into different schools.
* They have been preserved in essentially the same form since then.
* We possess s from a substantial variety of ancient Indian Buddhist schools, including the Mahāvihāra (modern-day Theravāda) of Sri Lanka, the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, Sarvāstivāda, and others of uncertain affiliation.
* A century of detailed study has consistently shown that they are essentially identical in doctrine irrespective of transmission lineage.

## 3.1.1 Overview

* The basic facts were discovered in the 19th century.
* In 1859 Samuel Beal published side by side translations of the Pali *pātimokkha* and the Dharmaguptaka *prātimokṣa* in Chinese, showing their virtually identical content.
* He noted that the identity of the code in both cases seems to be established.
* In 1882 Beal described detailed correspondences between Suttas in Chinese and Pali.
* This pioneering work was followed by a series of studies by Anesaki, Akanuma, Yin Shun, Thích Minh Châu, and many other scholars.

*  Beal's findings regarding the *pātimokkha* were confirmed in 1928 by the Japanese scholar Ryūzan Nishimoto and again, apparently independently, in 1955 by W. Pachow.
* Both of these studies showed that all existing recensions of the *pātimokkha*, which total around twenty texts from at least 7 different schools, are very similar in content.

* Recently, in his detailed and thorough Comparative Study of the Majjhima Nikāya, Anālayo shows that all significant aspects of early Buddhist doctrine are the same across all extant textual transmissions of the Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya.
* Among the parallels to the Suttas of the Pali Majjhima Nikāya, the most important textual source, due to its completeness, is the Sarvāstivādin Madhyama Āgama preserved in Chinese.

* The Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda lineages must have separated approximately at the time of the Asokan missionary activities.
* This means that these texts have been transmitted separately for almost 2,300 years, including a period of separate oral transmission that lasted several centuries.
* And yet the doctrinal content is for all intents and purposes identical.

* Moreover, this conservatism must have been inherited from the more unified—both geographically and doctrinally—form of Buddhism that existed prior to Asoka.




## 3.1.2 Mhsṅhik Comprisons

* The s are shared between the oldest schools of Buddhism and stem from the period of early unified Buddhism.
* The first doctrinal split was between the Sthaviras and the Mahāsāṅghikas, with some scholars suggesting that material common to both should be considered most authentic.
* However, textual lineages can separate for reasons other than sectarian identity, such as geographical isolation.
* Despite this, it's worthwhile to consider the material in common between the Sthaviras and Mahāsāṅghikas because their split was the first motivated by doctrinal differences.

* Similarities between the s of the Mahāsāṅghikas and those of other schools include:
    * The Mahāsāṅghika *pātimokkha* is essentially the same as all other extant *pātimokkhas*.
    * Canonical Vinaya material outside the *pātimokkha* is similar in content.
    * The Lokottaravādins' Vinaya contains significant passages in common with other early collections.
    * The Mahāsāṅghika account of the First Council names four Āgama collections, equivalent to the first four Nikāyas of the Pali canon.
    * Fragments of the Mahāsāṅghika Mahāparinirvāṇa and Caṁgi Sūtras have been found.
    * The Mahāvastu narrates the life of the Buddha, largely in legendary form, but contains references to early Buddhist doctrines and Suttas similar to those in the s.
    * The Ekottara Āgama school preserved in Chinese shares basic doctrine and many texts with other s.
    * The Śālistamba Sūtra, thought to derive from the Mahāsāṅghika school, contains phrases and ideas on dependent origination found in all the s.

## 3.1.3 Lter Borrowin

* Similarities between the s cannot be due to later borrowing because known cases of such borrowing do not show the pervasive and consistent similarities found between different recensions of the s.
* Schopen suggests that shared content may be due to later borrowing, levelling, and standardisation, but Anālayo argues against this.

* Evidence against later borrowing includes:
    * The Vinaya's *pātimokkha* is almost identical across every school, while the *vibhaṅga* material is substantially different.
    * Abhidhammas of various schools diverge more than the s, but share passages quoting the s.

* Examples of actual borrowing between schools show differences from the uniformity within the s:
    * The Buddha legend shows shared borrowings of ideas, episodes, and motifs, not massive sharing of identical texts.
    * Jātakas and other Buddhist stories appear to have been borrowed across traditions, but the resulting similarities are different from those within the s.

* In philosophy, key Abhidhammic ideas are shared between schools but defined in similar ways and appear in widely differing contexts.

## 3.2 The Reibiity Of The Or Trdition

* There is strong evidence that the oral tradition in Buddhism was highly reliable.
* For several hundred years, texts were passed down orally before being written down.
* Comparative studies show that this oral transmission was reliable and core doctrinal material remained unchanged.
* Indian culture provided methods for accurate oral preservation, as seen with the Ṛg Veda.

* The Buddhist tradition used techniques like repetition, standardization of language, synonyms, mnemonic devices, and structured narratives to ensure accuracy in oral transmission.

## 3.3 A Democrcy Of Conservtism

* The decentralized structure of the Buddhist Sangha favored conservatism in preserving teachings.
* Unlike many religious organizations, there was no central authority figure after the Buddha.
* Texts were passed down through group recital (*saṅgīti*), preventing any individual from significantly altering them.
* Differences between recensions are mainly due to editorial choices and minor errors during transmission.

* Doctrinal development happened through new texts and interpretations, not deliberate changes to existing ones.

## 3.4 How To Mke It Up

* Passages in the Vinayas instructing on "making up" texts refer to standardizing background details, not doctrinal content.
* These instructions confirm that incidental details were added later for context and clarity.
* The purpose was to create a container for the text, giving it a distinct identity.

* Misinterpretations of these passages suggest deliberate fabrication, which is inaccurate.

## 3.5 The E Of Pi


* Pali, the language of the Buddhist texts, is closely related to the language spoken by the Buddha.
* While Pali may be an artificial language developed after the Buddha, linguistic differences between Pali and the Asokan period are minor and rarely affect meaning.
* The standardization of Pali likely arose from the need for a common language as Buddhism spread.

* There's no evidence of Sinhalese influence on the Pali texts, suggesting they were standardized before reaching Sri Lanka.

## 3.6 Mnuscripts

* The earliest extant Indic manuscripts are Gāndhārī Buddhist texts from Afghanistan dating back to the 1st century CE.
* These texts include Dhammapada, discourses in verse and prose, non-canonical texts like Avadānas and Pūrvayogas, commentaries, and Abhidharma texts.
* This pattern of textual distribution aligns with expectations for the period immediately after the beginning of the common era.
* Many of these texts belong to the s, and those studied in detail show a close affinity with other s.

## 3.7 Schory Opinion

* There is a general consensus among specialists in early Buddhism that the s are largely authentic.
* Scholars who specialize in later Buddhism tend to be more skeptical about the authenticity of the s.
* Several prominent scholars, including Rupert Gethin, Richard Gombrich, Peter Harvey, J. W. de Jong, Étienne Lamotte, Hajime Nakamura, Noble Ross Reat, A. K. Warder, Maurice Winternitz, and Alexander Wynne, argue for the authenticity of the s based on internal evidence and historical context.
* Critics like Edward Conze, Ronald Davidson, Karen Lang, Kogen Mizuno, Geoffrey Samuel, and Gregory Schopen express doubts about the authenticity of the s, citing lack of concrete evidence or suggesting later redactions.

## 3.8 Stbiity Of Consensus


* The views of early Indologists largely align with the consensus among contemporary scholars regarding the authenticity of the s.
* Scholars like Samuel Beal, Wilhelm Geiger, Hermann Oldenberg, and T. W. Rhys Davids argued for the early origin and authenticity of the s based on textual analysis and historical context.
* These early insights continue to provide a framework for modern Buddhist scholarship, even as new discoveries and analyses refine our understanding.

# Chronooic Tbe Of Buddhist Iterture From The Buddh'S Time To The Time Of Asok

* This text provides a chronological overview of Buddhist literature from the Buddha's time to the time of King Ashoka. 
* It lists various Buddhist texts in order of their presumed composition, starting with simple statements of doctrine and progressing to more complex works like the Abhidhamma.
* The author acknowledges that this chronology is a simplification and subject to debate but offers it as a helpful guide for understanding the development of Buddhist literature.

# Chrcter Of The Ery Buddhist Texts

* This section argues that the earliest Buddhist texts, known as the Suttas, are stylistically distinct from later Buddhist writings.
* It suggests that this unique character is due to their authorship primarily by the Buddha himself.
* The author cites evidence such as consistent doctrine and phrasing, as well as a different literary style compared to other Buddhist texts.

## 4.1 Vedic Infuence On The Ebts

* This subsection explores the influence of Brahmanical literature (the Vedas) on the Suttas.
* It points out similarities in literary style, framing narratives, organizing principles, metaphors, and imagery between the Suttas and the Vedas.
* The author concludes that the Suttas adopted aspects of the Vedic model because it was the only successful and lasting literary tradition available at the time.

## 4.2 Literry Fetures

* This section analyzes linguistic features unique to the Suttas, distinguishing them from other Buddhist texts.

### 4.2.1 Grmmr

* The Suttas exhibit grammatical features characteristic of Western India, including Magadha, but not Sri Lanka.
* These features suggest a geographical origin for the Suttas in Western India, possibly Avanti, which was on the trade route to Sri Lanka.

### 4.2.2 Vocbury

* The vocabulary of the Suttas is distinct from that of other Buddhist texts.
* It draws heavily from Upaniṣadic and contemporary sources, while later Buddhist texts borrow their vocabulary from the Suttas and more recent trends.




## References 4.2.3 Metre

* Metrical analysis can help date Pali verses and identify their historical period.
* While archaic words and grammatical features might suggest ancient origins for some verses, metrical analysis provides a more reliable dating method.
* The *vatta* metre in Pali texts is similar to that found in the Upaniṣads but chronologically slightly later.

## 4.2.4 Stye

* The s tend to be concise and realistic, while non-s often feature embellishments and supernatural events.
* The s portray the Buddha realistically, without excessive supernormal powers, whereas non-s frequently depict him with such abilities.
* The stylistic differences between the s and non-s reflect their distinct purposes: the s aim for historical accuracy, while non-s prioritize conveying timeless Dharma teachings.

## 4.2.5 Or Vs. Iterry Trdition

* The s are an oral literature, composed before the widespread use of writing in Buddhist texts (likely no later than the first century
).
* Mnemonic features like repetition are intrinsic to the s and reflect their origin in oral transmission.
* Most non-s lack these mnemonic features, suggesting they were composed for written transmission.

## 4.3 Fvour Of  Sine Cretor

* The s exhibit a distinctive personal style with unique characteristics: vivid similes and metaphors, analytical language use, irony and humour, and internal consistency.
* Many of the ideas presented in the s are revolutionary for their time.
* This distinct style sets the s apart from other Buddhist literature and even the Upaniṣads.

## 4.3.1 Consistency Nd Coherence

* The s are coherent and consistent, more so than any comparable literature.
* This consistency is reflected in their rigorous doctrinal teachings and diverse themes, contexts, settings, and presentations.
* There are few doctrinal contradictions within the s, unlike other ancient literature like the Upaniṣads.
* Examples of this consistency include:

    * Creation myths: The s consistently assert that the beginning of creation cannot be known, while the Bṛhadāraṇyaka offers six different creation myths with varying origins.
    * Senses: The s always list six senses in the same sequence and never mix them with other things, while the Bṛhadāraṇyaka lists thirteen different sense combinations.

## 4.3.2 Ntern Cross-References

* The s frequently refer to other s but never to other Buddhist texts.
* This shows that they were seen as a separate genre of texts and an integrated body of teachings representing the Buddha's message.
* Examples of internal cross-referencing include:

    * Named Sutta collections (e.g., Aṭṭhaka Vagga, Pārāyana Vagga)
    * Named Suttas (e.g., Ajitapañha, Brahmajāla, Dhammacakka)
    * Named doctrinal categories (e.g., four noble truths, sets of dhammas known as the 37 *bodhipakkhiya dhamma*, noble eightfold path)
    * Named specific teachings (e.g., craving being a dart, whatever is felt is included in suffering)
    * Named similes (e.g., simile of the saw, simile of the butcher's knife and block)

## 4.3.3 Vivid & Reistic

* The s convey a vivid and realistic picture of India and Indian society at the time.
* This realism is evident in detailed descriptions of:

    * Everyday activities (e.g., arrow making, boat building, chariot riding, conveying greetings)
    * Scenes from everyday life (e.g., acrobat, caravan of merchants, domestic scene, leper, snake catching)
    * Environment (e.g., animals, autumn sun, creeper destroying a tree, fortress, lotuses)

* These details are often accurate and specific, suggesting firsthand knowledge rather than later invention.


## 4.3.4 Nnovtion

* The s are highly innovative compared to other Buddhist texts.
* They introduce revolutionary ideas like non-self (*anattā*), dependent origination, and the Buddhist version of karma.
* Other innovations include:

    * New doctrinal structures (e.g., four noble truths, eightfold path)
    * New analyses of experience (e.g., five aggregates)
    * The *pātimokkhas*, which appear to be a novelty in Indian law

* Non-s primarily focus on filling gaps in the s, working out their consequences, and systematising them.

## 4.3.5 Cims Of Incoherence

* Scholarship has not found consequential contradictions within the s.
* A challenge to the coherence of the s comes from those who argue that Buddhism contains fundamental teachings that are hard to reconcile.
* This claim is often based on a lack of distinction between canonical and non-canonical texts.
* Relying solely on limited texts from the s can lead to misinterpretations.

## 4.4 Contrdictions Nd Oddities Not Normalised

* There are blatant disagreements between statements found in the s and other Buddhist literature, but these were not changed for greater harmony.

## 4.4.1 Odd Detis & Inconruities

* Despite being highly consistent overall, the s contain quirky details that convey a realistic flavour.
* These oddities include:
    * Rāma, Uddaka's father, being spiritually attained, not Uddaka.
    * Upaka hearing the Dhamma from the Buddha but walking off in the wrong direction.
    * The Buddha laying down rules and then modifying or rescinding them.
    * The Buddha sleeping on a pile of leaves on a cattle track in winter.
    * The Buddha washing his own feet.
    * The Buddha personally helping to tend an ill monk.
    * The Buddha not being recognized as such, but seen as a regular monk.
    * The Buddha being disparagingly called various names.
    * A brahman verbally abusing the Buddha.
    * The Buddha being reluctant to meet with noisy brahman householders offering him food.
    * The Buddha dismissing monks because they are too noisy, then changing his mind due to lay people.
    * The Buddha saying he is at ease responding to nature's calls when alone.
    * Monk Meghiya not fulfilling his duties towards the Buddha.
    * Monks not delighting in a discourse given by the Buddha.
    * Ānanda using sneaky means to get the Buddha to give a talk.
    * Monk Bhaddāli refusing to keep the *pātimokkha* rule about eating after midday.
    * An out-of-context episode where king Pasenadi conveys a message from two unknown sisters to the Buddha.
    * The Buddha teaching king Pasenadi how to lose weight.
    * The Gandhabba Pañcasikha singing a love song to the Buddha.
    * The Buddha reflecting at length in vain to help Devadatta.
    * No mention of relics after Sāriputta's death.
    * No mention of Moggallāna's death circumstances.
    * The Buddha saying the Sangha seems empty after Sāriputta and Moggallāna have passed away.
    * King Ajātasattu not knowing where the Buddha is seated in the assembly.
    * The Buddha complaining of a bad back and lying down during a Dhamma talk.
    * The Buddha getting tired from being asked about rebirth.
    * The Buddha in old age warming his back, having flaccid limbs, and stooped posture.
    * The Buddha saying rules should be kept as they are, but later saying minor rules can be abolished.
    * The Sangha not knowing which rules the Buddha referred to and keeping them all.
    * The Buddha dying of bloody diarrhoea.
    * Ānanda not reaching arahantship until after the Buddha passed away.
    * The Pali Vinaya saying only Dhamma and Vinaya were recited at the First Council, but the Dīgha Nikāya commentary contradicting this by saying Abhidhamma was also recited.
    * Purāṇa saying he will not remember the Dhamma as recited at the First Council, but according to what he heard.

* These episodes were not edited out despite their awkwardness and contradiction with later ideas, indicating a conservative attitude towards preserving the s.

## 4.4.2 Lter Texts Re Obvious


* Later texts reveal themselves in multiple ways, suggesting ancient Buddhists weren't interested in creating realistic fakes.
* Identifying later additions often involves using multiple independent criteria, such as:
    * Lack of parallels in non-Pali s.
    * Extravagant praise not found elsewhere in the s.
    * Textual duplication and redundancy.
    * Abhidhamma type vocabulary not found elsewhere in the s.
    * Juxtaposition of different literary styles.

* Redactors did not attempt to disguise later additions, sometimes acknowledging them in commentaries.
* Many Suttas are set after the Buddha's demise, acknowledged in both the s and later tradition.
* The fact that most texts don't acknowledge lateness tends to authenticate them as originating from the historical Buddha.

## 4.4.3 Life Of The Buddh

* The s display little interest in the Buddha's biography, unlike other Buddhist literature.
* This suggests that the s stem mainly from the historical Buddha himself who was interested in teaching Dhamma, not his life story.
* After his death, biographical literature developed due to a need for it, starting with the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta and culminating in full-fledged biographies like the Mahāvastu and Lalitavistara.

* The few details about Buddha's life in the s often contradict later legends. Examples include:
    * His past lives practices not leading to Awakening vs. practicing as a bodhisatta for an incalculable period.
    * No notion of being a bodhisatta in past lives vs. taking the bodhisatta vow under Dīpaṅkara Buddha.
    * Leaving home motivated by human suffering and violence vs. becoming a bodhisatta out of compassion.

* These contradictions suggest that the s were kept unchanged despite potential discrepancies, showcasing the Sangha's conservatism.

## 4.5 Supernorm Eements

* The supernormal aspects in the s can be explained by the worldview integral to Buddhist doctrine and editorial decisions enhancing Buddhism's prestige.
* Steven Collins argues that interactions between Buddha and supernaturals make the historical value of the s questionable, as later generations could have invented these encounters. However, this argument is flawed because:

    * The frequency of such interactions in the Pali Canon is exaggerated.
    * Supernormal beings are mostly peripheral, appearing in narratives surrounding core doctrinal content.
    * This suggests that redactors focused on circumstantial material, leaving the core message untouched.

* Collins' dismissal of the s based on supernormal elements is extreme. A careful investigator should analyze these elements and their roles within the literature instead.

# 4.6 Structure
* The Saṁyutta Nikāya/Āgama is structured according to the four noble truths, with topics reflecting each truth.
* This structure aligns with the *bodhipakkhiya dhammas*, suggesting a holistic and integrated collection of teachings.
* Some scholars propose that the first three *aṅgas* represent an early form of the Saṁyutta, indicating a possible proto-canon before the current Nikāyas/Āgamas.

# 4.6.2 Frct Structure
* The s exhibit fractal characteristics, meaning they are self-similar at different levels of detail.
* This is evident in both content (e.g., the four noble truths) and form (e.g., repetition).
* Fractal patterns suggest organic growth and expansion of teachings rather than artificial construction.

# Archeology
* Archaeological evidence strongly supports the widespread presence of Buddhism in India during its early centuries.
* Many sites mentioned in the s have been identified through excavations, with findings dating back to Asoka's time or earlier.
* The scarcity of pre-Mauryan archaeological finds is attributed to the use of perishable materials and the beginning of the script and picture age during the Mauryan period.

## 5.2 Asokn Edicts

* Asoka's edicts reveal that Buddhism was a major religious movement in India less than two centuries after the Buddha.
* The edicts are dated about 150 years after the Buddha and are the earliest epigraphic evidence in Indian history.
* They record Asoka's deeds and proclamations, indicating Buddhism was already a significant force in Indian religion before his reign.

* **Elements in the inscriptions that agree with the s:**
    * No living beings should be killed or offered as sacrifice.
    * Provisions were made for medical treatment of humans and animals.
    * Wells were dug and trees planted for their use.
    * Respect for parents, generosity to friends and relatives, nonviolence towards animals, moderation in spending and possessions are good deeds.

    * Proper behavior towards relatives, brahmans and ascetics, respect for the aged is important.
    * Instructing in the Dhamma is the highest work.
    * Good deeds are difficult to perform while bad acts are easy.
    * Asoka considered the welfare of the whole world his duty.

    * Asoka visited Bodhgaya on a Dhamma tour and instructed people in the Dhamma.
    * He disapproved of excessive ceremonies and favored proper behavior towards slaves, respect for teachers, restraint regarding animals, generosity towards brahmans and ascetics.
    * There is no gift like the gift of the Dhamma.

    * One should listen to and respect the doctrine of others.
    * Asoka repented conquering the Kāliṅgas and stated that "conquest by Dhamma is the best conquest."
    * He advised his officials to practice the middle way.
    * He said one should not act from envy, anger, cruelty, hurry, indifference, laziness or fatigue.

    * Asoka told his subjects he acted towards them like a father and felt for them as he felt for himself.
    * He called himself an *upāsaka*, a Buddhist lay disciple, a Śākya, one who belongs to the Buddha's (spiritual) family, and possibly a Budhaśake, a Sakyan of the Buddha.

    * He said he had visited the Sangha and honored it, hoping it has little affliction and is dwelling at ease.
    * He expressed his respect and faith in the "budha dhaṁma saṁgha" and stated that all that was spoken by the Buddha was well-spoken.
    * He spoke of the long duration of the true dhamma and listed a number of Buddhist texts as recommended study curriculum: Vinaya-samukasa, Aliya-vasāni, Anāgata-bhayāni, Muni-gāthā, Moneya-sūta, Upatisa-pasina, Lāghulovāda.

    * Asoka stated that Dhamma consists of doing few bad deeds, many good deeds, being compassionate, generous, truthful and pure.
    * He said he had conferred many benefits on bipeds, quadrupeds, birds and fish.
    * He listed ways to bad conduct: fierceness, cruelty, anger, pride, envy.

    * Asoka abolished the death penalty and prohibited violence against and killing of various animals.
    * He summarized his good deeds and mentioned the Jains (*nigaṁṭha*) and the Ājīvakas.
    * He stated that people's progress in Dhamma is achieved in two ways: by Dhamma rules and by conviction, with conviction being more important.

    * Asoka declared Lumbinī, the Buddha's birthplace, tax-free.
    * He condemned schism in the Sangha and stated that any monk or nun who causes such a schism should be disrobed.

    * An edict mentions the stupa of Buddha Konāgamana and that Asoka paid his respects there.

* Although much of the content is not specifically Buddhist, the overall tenor is Buddhist.
* There is nothing in these edicts that contradicts the teachings in the s.


## 5.3 Brbr Cves

* The inscriptions on these caves confirm the existence of a religious order frequently mentioned in the s: the Ājīvaka sect.
* Asoka and his grandson Dasaratha made rock-cut caves for the ascetics of this sect in the 3rd century.


## 5.4 Bodh Gy

* The place of the Buddha's Awakening is a rich archaeological site dating back at least to Asoka.
* The *vajrāsana*, meant to mark the spot where the Buddha attained awakening, is likely the oldest archaeological relic at Bodhgaya and dates to the time of Asoka.
* Artwork on the railings at Bodhgaya from the 2nd century depicts Buddhist motifs:

    * Lotus symbol
    * First meditation (MN 36.31)
    * First teaching, symbolised by the *dhammacakka* (SN 56:11/SĀ 379/T 109/T 110/EĀ 19.2/P 747/P 1003)
    * Indra's visit (DN 21/DĀ 14/T 15/MĀ 134)

    * *Parinibbāna*, symbolised by stupa (DN 16.6.7–9/DĀ 2/T 5/T 6/T 7/T 1451/SMPS 42.11–18)
    * Grass cutter's gift (JN 93)
    * Wonder of parting the water and walking on dry ground (Vin  32)

    * Return to Kapilavatthu (Vin  82–83 and JN 118–119)
    * Gift of Jetavana (Vin  158–159)
    * Homage to Buddha by Pārileyyaka elephant (Vin  353)

    * A dozen Jātakas (7 unidentified)

## 5.5 Deur Kothar

* Contains some of the earliest stupas and Asokan-era writing.
* Includes rock shelters, simple art, an Asokan pillar, and Northern Black Polished Ware.
* Likely stems from the beginnings of Buddhist popular monuments.
* Abstract motifs are congruent with the early s, which lacked concrete narrative but emphasized abstract teaching.

* Two brahmī inscriptions connect donors to the Buddha through teacher/student lineages.
* Inscriptions include Buddhist terms like *bhagavat*, Budha, upasaka, ācariya, and ātevāsi.
* Damaged inscriptions suggest a connection to the Buddha 9-14 generations prior.

## 5.6 Bhrhut

* Major archaeological site attesting to Buddhism as a well-established Indian religion during Asoka's time.
* Stupa begun by Asoka, with most of the visible structure dating to the Sunga dynasty (2nd and early 1st century).
* Contains many Buddhist images and references.
* Representations of the Buddha are aniconic.

* Depicts scenes from the Buddha's life: Awakening, first discourse, Indra's visit, worship by King Ajātasattu, passing away.
* Includes depictions of various Buddhas, people, places, and details from the s.
* Mentions text reciters, technical terms, divine beings, plants, assemblies, things, and acts.

* Suggests that the s existed at this time and were influential for a considerable period prior to Bhārhut.
* Includes non- details like Buddha legend, Jātakas, relic worship, stupa worship, purchase of Jetavana, Saṅkika/Saṅkassa ladder, *Gadhakuti* and *Kosabakuti*, and *Patisamdhi*.

## 5.7 Sñcī


* Large complex showing Buddhism's spread and power beyond the Ganges plain within 150–200 years of the Buddha's lifetime.
* Monastery/stupa complex located near Vidisa, nearly 1,000 km from Pāṭaliputta.

* Originated in Asoka's time, with much of the visible structure added later.
* Relics of the Buddha's chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, were discovered here.
* Smaller stupas contained relics and references to monks who were missionaries during Asoka's reign.

* Eastern Gateway depicts Asoka sending a branch of the Bodhi tree to Sri Lanka, corroborating accounts in the Mahāvaṁsa.

## 5.7.1 Artwork

* **Straight from EBTs:** Scenes depict the Buddha's birth, austerities, Awakening, first teaching, Bamboo Grove in Rājagaha, Indasālā visit by Sakka and Ajātasattu, and Mahāparinibbāna.
* **EBTs, with elaboration:** First meditation, divine messengers, Brahmā and Sakka asking the Buddha to teach, strife over relics ("War of the Relics").
* **Borderline EBT:** Serpent Mucalinda, first disciples Tapussa and Bhallika, guardian devas giving bowls, victory over *nāga*, Indra and Brahmā visiting Buddha at Uruvelā, Buddha stopping splitting wood and lighting fire, parts water, visits Kapilavatthu, converts Jaṭilas, Bimbisāra's visit, Buddha's footprint with *dhammacakka*.
* **Mostly non-EBT, but with EBT kernel:** Māyā's dream and conception, temptation by Māra, Buddha's residences at Jetavana and Nigrodhārāma, teaching the Sakyas, offering of honey.
* **Non-EBT:** Buddha leaving on Kanthaka, Kanthaka's legs supported by devas, Sujātā offering milk rice, Sotthiya offering grass, Buddha walking meditating after Awakening, jewel house for contemplation, twin wonder under mango tree, Buddha going to Tāvatiṁsa heaven.

* **Straight from EBTs:** Six Buddhas and their trees, cosmography with Four Great Kings.
* **Mostly non-EBT, but with EBT kernel:** Maitreya with his tree of awakening.
* **Non-EBT:** Relic worship, Asoka visiting *stupa* at Rāmagāma and Bodhi tree, five Jātaka stories.

## 5.7.2 Inscriptions

* **Reciters of scriptural collections:** Terms like *sutātika*, *dhamakathika*, *pacenekayika*, *sutatikiniyā*.

* **Names:** Sāriputa (relics), Mahā Mogalāna (relics), Idadeva (= Sakka).

## 5.8 Piprhw/Gnwri

* The Piprahwa finds, including a soapstone casket with Asokan Brahmi inscriptions and bone relics, suggest the Buddha's cremation relics were distributed as described in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta.
* The inscription likely indicates the Sakyan brothers Sukiti received some relics.
* Another relic casket without inscription was found at a lower level, dating to the Mauryan period.

* Sealings with "Kapilavastu" inscription found nearby strengthen the link to the Buddha's birthplace.
* Archaeological finds date back to around 500 BCE, consistent with the Buddha's life and descriptions in the s.

## 5.9 Rjh

* The geography of Rājagaha is vividly depicted in the s, including hot springs mentioned as the occasion for a Vinaya rule.
* Many ruins of stupas and monasteries exist, though their exact dating is uncertain.
* A cave identified as Sattapaṇṇi Cave, where the First Council was held, is small, suggesting a humble gathering.

* A 40 km long dry-stone wall, likely pre-Mauryan fortifications, surrounds Rājagaha.
* This may correspond to the wall from New Rājagaha, dated to the 4th century BCE, aligning with the s' account of Ajātasattu fortifying Rājagaha after the Buddha's death.

## 5.10 Mthur

* Mathurā appears in the archaeological record as a major centre of Buddhism from around 150 BCE.
* The city's artwork has a characteristic "Mathuran" style, suggesting earlier artistic cultures.
* Prior to this period, only traces of mud brick walls and artifacts like Northern Black Polished Ware have been found.
* This suggests Mathurā was a minor trading town during the Buddha's lifetime.

## 5.11 Other Muryn Excvtions

* Many excavations confirm the existence of places mentioned in the s around the time of the Buddha.
* Asokan era Buddhist remains have been discovered at major locations mentioned in the s, as well as lesser-known ones.
* Archaeological findings at Sāvatthī and Vesālī date back to the 6th century BCE, aligning with the dating of the Buddha.
* The archaeological record generally supports the descriptions of towns in the middle Ganges plain found in the s.

## 5.12 South Ndin Rt Nd Inscriptions

* Archaeology in South India confirms the spread of Buddhism and Aryan culture after the Asokan period.
* Amarāvatī, a major Buddhist site, shows evidence of early Buddhist art dating back to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE.
* Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang mentions a monastery built by Asoka's son in South India, suggesting an early arrival of Buddhism in the region.

## 5.13 Northern Bck Poished Wre Cuture

* The Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) culture spans the same region and time period as the s.
* This culture is characterized by glazed pottery, iron use, burnt bricks, and coinage.
* Magadha's rise to power may be linked to iron ore mines in the region.
* The geographical distribution of NBPW aligns with the area known in the s.

## Development Of Buddhism

* Changes in Buddhism can be traced through earlier and later texts.
* Later texts contain developments not found in earlier ones, but still refer to them.
* Earlier texts are independent of later developments.

## 6.1 First Counci

* All early Buddhist schools have a record of the s being recited and systematized after the Buddha's death.
* The First Council is recorded in all Vinayas, although they differ on details.
* They agree that the council focused on reciting the s.

## 6.2 Second Counci

* A century after the Buddha, a Second Council was held to address new practices among monks.
* This council highlights the conservative nature of the early Sangha and their commitment to preserving the teachings.
* The Sangha's duty was to ensure the "True Dhamma" lasted long, rejecting any changes or interpretations.

## 6.3 Literry Deveopments

* The content of later canonical books reflects the concerns of Buddhists in the Mauryan period and differs significantly from earlier texts.
* Two influential trends in Mauryan Buddhism were:
    * The Sangha's growth, specialization, and development of Buddhist exegesis.
    * The spread of Dhamma to a broader lay community.

* These trends are reflected in the content of doctrinally secondary books like Abhidhamma texts (highly specialized) and popular stories like Jātakas and Buddha biographies.
* The Pali school's literary style in Sri Lanka differs from that inherited from India, suggesting the Pali canon was considered closed upon arrival on the island during Asoka's time.

* The absence of mention about the Buddha visiting Sri Lanka in the Pali canon is significant as it would have been tempting to include this popular legend. This omission highlights the conservatism of the tradition.
* Mahāyāna texts, while claiming to be spoken by the Buddha, clearly belong to a later literary period than the s due to stylistic and linguistic reasons.

## 6.3.1 Jtks

* The Jātaka literature is attested in the Mauryan period but is later than the s.
* Depictions of Jātakas in early Buddhist monuments like Bhārhut and Sāñcī predate the s, despite often depicting social conditions earlier than the Buddha's time.
* Key differences between Jātakas and Suttas include:

    * Jātakas are almost entirely narrative while Suttas contain doctrinal teachings.
    * Jātakas lack distinct Buddhist terminology found in Suttas.
    * The protagonist is always the bodhisatta in Jātakas, whereas it's the Buddha or his disciples in Suttas.
    * Jātakas have a different structure than Suttas.

## 6.4 Doctrin Deveopments

* Virtually every significant doctrine undergoes development from the s to later canonical texts and beyond.
* These developments are not random but follow broad patterns characteristic of philosophical and doctrinal evolution.
* Examples of doctrinal developments include:

    * Karma as destiny (Vimāna- and Peta-vatthu)
    * Transference of merit (Petavatthu)
    * Elaboration on rebirth destinations (Vimāna- and Peta-vatthu)
    * Shift in attitude towards jhāna, especially lokuttarajjhāna (Vibh)

    * Dependent origination happening on an 'occasion' (Vibh 145)
    * Detailed explanations of obscure doctrines from the s (Vism)
    * Increased detail and expansion in core teachings (Vism)
    * Abstract teachings vs. applied teachings (Abhidhamma, Paṭisambhidāmagga)
    * Systematization of "*dhammas*" (Dhammasaṅgaṇī)

* The Vibhaṅga of the Abhidhamma clearly shows the direction of doctrinal development: Sutta analysis is similar to the s while Abhidhamma analysis is a new development.


## 6.4.1 Absence Of Sectrin Views

* Analysis of thousands of s reveals very few traces of sectarian ideas, indicating they were essentially fixed before the sectarian period.
* A rare exception is occasional interpolations of the three times (past, present, future) in the Sarvāstivāda Saṁyukta Āgama.

* Schools generally did not insert their own views into the s but developed them in other literature like the Abhidhamma.

## 6.4.2 Ery Abhidhmm


* The Abhidhamma, originating in the pre-sectarian period, became a separate class of literature, indicating the s were already developed, widely accepted, and canonical.
* The earliest stratum of Abhidhamma literature quotes from the Suttas and offers analysis or elaboration.

* This shows the Abhidhamma came into existence after the s.
* Shared material between schools suggests the Abhidhamma project began in the nascent sectarian period (around 300 BCE).

## 6.4.3 Kthvtthu

* The Kathāvatthu originated during the Mauryan period and references canonical Buddhist texts accepted by all Buddhists.
* Dating evidence suggests it was composed around 150-200 years after the Buddha, possibly under Asoka's reign.
* It takes the form of a dialogue presenting and debating interpretations of Buddhist scriptures.
* The scriptures themselves (specifically the Nikāyas/Āgamas) are considered the ultimate authority for resolving disputes.

## 6.5 Texts Rejected By Some

* Authenticity was a concern in early Buddhism, with some rejecting certain texts as late additions.
* Examples include the Mahāsāṅghika rejecting parts of the Pali Vinaya Piṭaka and Abhidhamma, and Chinese monks questioning the authenticity of some Mahayana Sutras.
* The Sautrāntikas also rejected the Abhidhamma.

# Theoretic Considertions 




## 7.1 Scientific Chrcteristics

* The theory of authenticity has characteristics of a scientific theory, while the theory of inauthenticity lacks these characteristics.
* **Falsifiability:** The theory of authenticity can be falsified by evidence like an early Mahāyāna Sūtra, while the theory of inauthenticity is difficult to falsify.
* **Plasticity:** The theory of authenticity has been refined over time based on new evidence, unlike the theory of inauthenticity.
* **Predictive power:** The theory of authenticity has accurately predicted discoveries like the presence of Pali Suttas in Chinese translations and archaeological sites mentioned in Buddhist texts.
* **Fecundity:** The theory of authenticity has led to advancements in fields like history, archaeology, and understanding Buddhist texts, while the theory of inauthenticity has not.
* **Simplicity:** The theory of authenticity relies on the simple assumption that the Buddha spoke most of the attributed texts, allowing for a clear understanding of Buddhism's development.
* **Extensiveness:** The theory of authenticity encompasses a wide range of facts about Early Buddhism, while the theory of inauthenticity considers only a small fraction.
* **Coherence:** The theory of authenticity is internally consistent and doesn't violate common sense principles, unlike the theory of inauthenticity which sometimes requires implausible assumptions.
* **Responsiveness:** The theory of authenticity engages with critiques and adapts accordingly, while the theory of inauthenticity remains largely unchanged despite criticism.

## 7.2 The Chrcter Of Inductive Theories


* The theory of authenticity is an inductive theory, similar to theories like evolution and global warming.
* It uses observations about Early Buddhism to develop general principles that explain the texts' origins.
* Inductive theories are probabilistic and better at establishing generalities than specifics.
* While we can't be certain about every specific phrase in the texts, we can confidently say that they likely originated from the Buddha based on the overall evidence.

## 7.3 The Probem Of Specifics

* It is easy to argue against authenticity due to variations in sources, but this obscures larger truths.
* An example is the phrase describing the Buddha's birthplace, which appears with slight variations in Pali, Sanskrit, and on the Lumbini Asokan pillar.
* These differences are minor and don't change the meaning, indicating a shared tradition across different sources.
* This suggests early Buddhists acknowledged the Buddha's birthplace and encouraged reflection upon it.

## 7.4 Deniist Buddhism

* Critics of Early Buddhism use skeptical arguments reminiscent of denialism in other fields.
* Denialist Buddhism shares characteristics with other forms of denialism, such as extreme skepticism and a lack of contribution to the field.
* Genuine epistemological problems exist in studying Early Buddhism, but dismissing the entire field due to uncertainty is unproductive.
* Studying Early Buddhism is valuable and worthwhile, despite challenges.

## 2. The Use Of Fake Experts (Often With The Smearing Of Real Experts).

* Denialists often cite "experts" who disagree with the consensus, but these experts are often from unrelated fields.
* Most hard skeptics come from later Buddhist traditions, while those specializing in Early Buddhism tend to affirm authenticity.

## 3. Demanding Impossible Standards For Research.

* Critics point to the absence of early manuscripts or specific archaeological evidence as reasons for doubt.
* This mirrors denialism in other fields, where the lack of certain concrete pieces of evidence is used to refute established theories.
* However, conclusions about Early Buddhism are based on converging lines of evidence, not singular proofs.

## 4. Use Of Fallacy, Including Misrepresentation And False Analogy.

* Schopen misrepresents the methods used by scholars of Early Buddhism.
* He claims that the cardinal tenet of higher criticism is that agreement among text versions indicates a pre-sectarian origin, ignoring the historical development of Buddhist scholarship.


## Concusion

* We know a great deal about the Buddha's life and teachings with greater certainty than for most historical figures from a comparable period.
* This knowledge comes primarily from the suttas, which exhibit a careful and conservative attitude towards knowledge.
* The Buddha emphasized the importance of wisdom and warned against rash conclusions.
* While caution is important, the Buddha also believed in the human capacity to know.
